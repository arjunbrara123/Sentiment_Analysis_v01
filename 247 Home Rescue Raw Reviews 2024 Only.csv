01/01/2024,01/01/2024,Ultra responsive,The company were ultra responsive to my enquiry. The cover provided meets all my expectations (on paper).The representative was obviously having to cover all his legal obligations when dealing with my application but it seemed a little rushed & not quite 'As Personal' at it could have been. I was satisfied with the final outcome & everything was included in the 'Welcome' letter.
01/01/2024,01/01/2024,If I could give this company 0 stars I…,If I could give this company 0 stars I would. The service we have received is absolutely disgusting. I’ve rang 6/7 times today chasing an engineer to come out and fix our boiler. For the last three days now we’ve had no heating or hot water. They told us they have referred our job to the manufacturer which is a load of crap. I rang the manufacture and they have no record of the job! Absolutely disgusting customer service. Payed a call outout fee of £45 and the engineer didn’t even take the boiler apart. He just looked at it. Don’t go with these cowboys.
02/01/2024,01/01/2024,"Not only was our experience shameful, the company has attempted to have me silenced on Trustpilot and other review sites.","Please read this review before placing your trust in this business. It would take me a week to detail all the areas where 247 let us down and behave in a manner which is beyond dodgy! Just a few are: 1. Abusing our personal details to repeatedly call, when you have expressly told them not to on several occasions. 2. Sending a racist engineer who told us ‘he only works for P****** because they pay him £15k a year more than his previous employer3. Supplying official paperwork telling us we needed essential safety work (not covered by our policy of course) despite never having carried out the necessary observation/ assessment of the area concerned. 4. Making critical errors in paperwork. Our boiler was serviced on 17/11/23; the date given for the next service required? 17/11/23. 5. Offering to quote for unnecessary work, which was described as a safety issue. 6. Their engineers will warn you that despite writing ‘customer not interested in new boiler’ you will get a call trying to sell you one, because that’s all they’re interested in. Taking your money! 7. Offering 3 months compensation for their poor service and engineer’s behaviour, then when you reiterate you want your contact details removed from their records, they cancel your policy completely, 3 months early, leaving you completely without cover over the winter. If you are considering this company for your boiler cover, be warned. Their customer service agents are ‘not allowed’ to escalate complaints to the managers. Apparently when their engineers tell you ‘they are all greedy (racist term!) who are only interested in taking your money’, they may indeed be speaking from experience."

02/01/2024,01/01/2024,How's your crystal ball ?,"Don't know about you, but mine's often dim so I don't get to predict the future much. However, when it comes to the central heating boiler I know what could happen in the future if it isn't given a little TLC, which means an annual check at least. Here's where the people at 24/7 home rescue come into their own. For not a lot of wonga they provide the necessary, which doesn't have to include the entire heating system, but does cover everything boiler.  Fortunately I have the tools and experience to cope with the rest, so I only need the boiler taking care of with the afore mentioned TLC. Once found their website is easy to navigate and the form filling's a breeze, checkout's not at all complicated, and did I mention it's affordable ?All necessary documentation arrives via email PDF so no snail mail, and if like me you like to have a hard copy to hand it's done and dusted in minutes.Talking of which I need to go and give my crystal ball a polish."

02/01/2024,01/01/2024,Extremely disappointed,"Extremely disappointed! Very poor service. My boiler had issue on the 30th December 23. The engineer was quick to arrive but after spending 1 hour the engineer couldn't find out what was wrong with the boiler.  In the end he gave up and said he needs to order a new front panel which he will do today and will be back either same day or Wednesday 3rd January 24. I was very understanding as I know its holidays etc so I will have to survive with no heating and no hot water for next few days. Received call today on the 2nd January 24 and I was told they ordered the part today and it now now be delivered and fixed on the 9th. I am family of 4 with 2 young kids. One child is under 3 years. We have been left to die in this cold weather with no heating or hot water. We all are ill due to cold weather and using cold water. 4 days no one had a shower.i have been left with extreme disappointment as I paid the highest amount per month to this company from day 1. Never missed a payment and in return what I get? Lies, delays and no positive response or help.Would really like a manger to call me to resolve this issue ASAP otherwise I will take my complaint further to OMBUDSMAN.  If not resolvedLooking forward to quick response."

Have monthly cover with them and on 2 occasions we've called due to a leak from our upstairs water tank, water pouring through the ceiling downstairs for them to tell us they can get someone out tomorrow. I fail to see how this company is 24/7!! Absolutely useless, don't waste your money, use a company that will genuinely provide 24/7 help! And to top that of, said water tank had just been serviced with themselves a couple of weeks prior, we asked for several things to be checked as had noticed some unusual changes, but was told it's all working perfectly, would seem this was incorrect now we have a flood as now we have a flood due to these changes we asked to be looked at!"

03/01/2024,01/01/2024,My annually invoiced contract was massively increased.,"My annually invoiced contract was coming up for renewal at the end of January and I had an email advisory from this company saying that the monthly equivalent (but annually billed) rate was going up from just over 5 pounds per month to over 14 pounds per month! So an over 2.5 times increase in premium. I had no claims and the same items of equipment i.e. no changes at all. I informed them that I would not be renewing based on this. Within a couple of days, I had a further email now saying they could do it for just over 8 pounds per month. It's like dealing with a shady used car dealership. I don't want a negotiation- I want a rock-solid reliable provider. I declined their volatile offer and canceled the renewal direct debit due in a few weeks. I then received a further email saying that my account is immediately suspended even though I have a few weeks left. So they have declined to provide a full years cover purely because I don't agree to a massive price increase and a renewal for the next year. I will certainly not be using them again and thankfully never had to lodge a claim. Now, they will respond to this post by either saying: (a) they can't identify me (i.e. this is intended to convince you, new Customer, that this is a fake review- it's not) or (b) please call us to discuss (that is intended to show you, new customer, how customer focussed they are and is not intended to offer me anything different).I guess my rating and advice on this vendor is pretty clear."

The recall was quickly accepted by the call centre, though I was a little disappointed that there would be a delay of 4 days before the engineer could come because it was reported on Friday and a weekend and New year's Day were upon us. On the Tuesday scheduled, the engineer rang first thing and arrived shortly after.

He noticed something that hadn't been done properly by last person and missed by previous maintenance from another company. Fantastic service from him! Regarding 24 /7 it takes a long time to get visit booked in and previous one got cancelled so waited another month but least worth it in the end and they did call before to try and sell me a product which I said no to.  Would also be good if you got a time slot nearer the time rather than having to be on standby for a full day.

Heating died, so Called 247 on Friday 29th due to no heating paid a 95.00 excess fee - engineer arrived 30th Dec 23 looked at system and said he had ordered new parts. not heard from again until pm 1st Jan 24 to say job is complete - NO ITS NOT STILL NO HEATING- 2nd engineer came out on 3rd Jan said he had ordered the parts, when he arrived I did have hot water but now NO LONGER HAVE HOT WATER - then on 4th Jan I am told I have to pay 108.00 for a drain down  for them to fit the parts,  so central heating is not really covered because if they need to fit parts they will charge you - day 7 tomorrow without heating and now no hot water - parts not ordered until i pay the £108.00 . They are supposed to supply 2 heaters if they cannot fix the heating they tell me I have to buy these and they will reimburse me  £30 - um no thanks decent heaters cost more than £30 each. the call system is a joke where the agents blame you for the delay in repairs. The complaints department if it exists seems to be unreachable. I feel like I am being SCAMMED by this company the contract is pretty much worthless.AVOID at all costs - the company name gives a feeling of immediate repairs  - pigs will fly firstUPDATE: they want me to pay the 108.00 and they will credit me 2 months premiums (about £26.00) as a gesture of good will.... its a joke shove the offer .... 7 days without heating and now 2 days with no hot water. Its costing me an extra 10 to 15 per day in additional cost for heating and hot water and they still wont resolve my heating. THE INSURANCE CONTRACT IS WORTHLESS.OMBUDSMAN, RIP OF BRITAIN AND COURTS  IN WAITING. OH AND THE CALL CENTRE IS IN KARACHI AND THEY HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF HEATING ISSUES ONLY WANTING WANTING PAYMENTS.UPDATE 5th Jan 24Took several calls to get the complaints department - don't believe it is the complaints department as the caller is in Karachi to call me. If I pay the scam money to get a drain down done they cannot say when it can be done 1 day, 2 days,  one week ??????.Have asked for a resolution letter but they are reluctant to provide this. day 8 tomorrow"

I am trying to cancel but they are trying to make it difficult by putting obstacles in place.Ref number is WS630765 and all I am getting now is messages telling me my direct debit has been cancelled which obviously I am aware of because I cancelled it also threatening my credit file if I don’t reinstate cover!!! To be honest not interested what so ever as the way you conduct business is both threatening and quite honestly a little bit desperate to get your £15.99 a month!!! Please stop texting and e-mailing me…..16/02/2024 STILL GETTING LOADS OF TEXTS AND EMAILS DESPITE GIVING YOU THE REG NUMBER!!!! Go away and stop bothering me!!!!!!!"

I haven't had a single instance with these guys that was not a headache. The team on the phone is extremely unhelpful and not well trained on customer service. I have this insurance so I don't worry about home repairs but instead it's always a pain every time I call. They try to push back on claims! The latest one was an electrical issue in the circuit of the washing machine socket and they say they do not cover isolated circuits. Watch out as they pick and choose and push back like hell. All my experiences with them have been a headache. I have asked for my services to be cancelled and I paid an excess, that's how much I needed to get rid of these guys. Even though they were the ones that didn't fulfil the agreement. The good reviews here have to be fake because believe. me they are inflexible and I urge you not to get cheated like I was."

We have a Home Care policy which covers plumbing amongst other things and when I logged a claim regarding a leaking water pipe in the kitchen, I was initially told that an engineer would NOT be able to come out until the leak was clearly identifiable, visible and accessible. Forgive my confusion, but is this not part of a plumber’s remit?After taking advice from a plumber friend, my husband cleared the area around the pipe. The leak was now clearly visible and accessible.Great, we thought, 247 Home Rescue will now be able to help and I immediately logged the claim a second time. How wrong we were : (When the call handler phoned me I again explained the fault but I was told because I’d informed (wrongly - it’s not the main supply pipe at all. But hey, what do I know about plumbing?) him it was a main water supply pipe, this is not covered under the policy. I actually asked how can they provide plumbing services when they don’t do plumbing? Ludicrous?!?! I was then asked to email a photo over which I did straight away. It’s now 24 hours later and I’ve still not received any communication from them.Please be extremely cautious before you sign on the dotted line.Please also note that the majority of 5* reviews on here are for the low price of the cover or boiler services."

They do not adopt fair practice and do not treat customers fairly. Absolutely no action was taken from 247 other than a failed call out on their part. I was charged for the failed attempt.The contractual terms and conditions are misleading and the 247 teams refuse to address it. I'd go to Homeserve instead."

Contacted customer service in relation to the leak not being addressed and denied they knew anything about a leak even when this was pointed out to the engineer.  Customer service spoke to the engineer who denied any knowledge of the leak.  Absolute liars.  When challenged they dismissed claim about the leak and basically called me a liar.  Customer is obviously not king with this shower of clowns.  Policy and renewal canceled with immediate effect.Update:After their token ""investigation "" not surprisingly they have dismissed my claim.  This underlines their engineers incompetence and their lack of customer service.  Asked to provide evidence of the water leak - why would I continue to let water leak over my brand new kitchen?

When I asked insurance to pay me that after sending them invoice, nothing? They said they will not pay me a penny😡👎🏻 please it’s worthless having emergency insurance with them if they're not going to help in need"

11/01/2024,01/01/2024,New boiler help,After my boiler broke down an engineer told me due to its age it was beyond economical repair. I then received a call from a man called Liam who explained my options. At all times he was clear and concise and took time to make sure I understood the situation and if I had a query he answered it fully. He was more than helpful with no hard sell. He also explained the benefit of having a Stay warm plan.
11/01/2024,01/01/2024,"'24/7 Home Rescue,' feels like a mockery","I wish to express my total dissatisfaction with 24/7 Home Rescue following the incident yesterday. The company is an utter chaos. I lodged a claim for a boiler breakdown, expecting professionalism, only to be met with dubious practices. They assured us of an engineer's visit which never materialized, leading to a cold day in our home.I called them multiple times, and each instance was met with fabrications from their agents. They repeatedly stated that an engineer would arrive as late as 19:30 hrs yesterday, which is laughable. It's particularly distressing as we clearly communicated that we have children at home, and it's becoming a nightmare without hot water and heating.Calling them again today did no good as they still had no intel on their engineer's whereabouts. Their lack of responsibility in keeping customers apprised of the progress is alarming. Moreover, my request for a callback from a manager has been blatantly ignored thus far, and we're still left shivering in the cold.The company's name, '24/7 Home Rescue,' feels like a mockery given this undeserving experience. Their service is far from a rescue, and I find it necessary to caution others before they consider utilising their services."

In this day and age so many engineers are rude and only want to spend as little time as possible rather than be thorough and give confidence to the customer. I would welcome him back into my home if ever we have more problems with our central heating system. 24/7 should be proud of having such a good engineer on their books. Thank you again."

12/01/2024,01/01/2024,Very bad service from this company,"I experienced extremely poor service from this company. They conducted an inspection of my boiler, which was functioning perfectly. However, the engineer arbitrarily shut down the boiler and left. Consequently, my children and I have been enduring freezing temperatures without access to hot water and heating. Upon contacting the company, I was informed of an issue but was told to wait 24 hours for a team to check for necessary parts.After the stipulated time, I called again, only to be informed that they could obtain the required part for a fee of £90. However, an additional waiting period of 24 hours was necessary for the booking team to contact me and schedule an appointment. Despite paying for the repair, the technicians arrived days later and departed without resolving the issue. Subsequent calls revealed that another part was needed, and I was required to wait for authorization for the purchase of the new part. Upon calling after 24 hours, I was informed of a charge of £340 for the additional part. This seemed absurd, considering I had already paid £90.Expressing my dissatisfaction, I requested to cancel the service, but I was told that I needed to pay £99, even though I was within the cooling-off period. I argued that I had already paid £90 for their service, which was not provided free of charge. However, they insisted on the £99 payment. In light of this experience, I strongly advise against choosing this company, as they lack competence and seem more interested in promoting expensive new boilers or charging exorbitant amounts than providing genuine assistance. Additionally, navigating through different departments and enduring prolonged response times make the overall experience extremely unhelpful."

No one called me back and now when I call them for repair for same issue, they are charging £95 call out fee as 14 days has passed. They are not helpful at all and are trying to just make extra money through call out charge. When their engineer came for Boiler service on 31st Jan, I requested him to take a look as he had only done the initial repair. He refused and said to call 24/7 for a new claim.

So I still have the problem! was just given advice! Was told I NEED TO CHANGE THE VALVES, so they are unable to cover this!  When signing up to the company they will be extremely convincing and persuasive, however don’t care they just after monthly payments and excess and not give anything in return! Can’t fix problems like they say they can! Would not recommend and homeserve much cheaper! And definitely will be sharing my experiences with others!

14/01/2024,01/01/2024,Change of mind!,"I changed from British Gas to 247 home rescue a couple of months ago.I was having problems with my boiler and had no hot water in the house. It has to be said that I was very excited when I first telephoned them because the call got answered in 30 seconds where with British Gas you generally have to wait 30 to 40 minutes.They telephoned me the following day and said that the first appointment they could give me was three days later… so much for 24/7 emergency! Also they gave me a time-slot between 8am and 6pm. At least British Gas give either a morning or afternoon slot.  I hope that I’m able to give you an update where I can give this service five stars.UPDATE!!They got back to me to tell me that somebody would come the following day and, allow me to be frank, the plumber, Ben, wasn’t just good, but he was absolutely fantastic. He had a lovely way with him rather than the British Gas engineers, who I am very sure must be picked for their lack of personality.I’m pleased to change my one star review into a five star review."
14/01/2024,01/01/2024,The one thing I needed them for - they did not do.,"I made an appointment for boiler service months ago via a link on a text message. I did not receive any confirmation of the appointment and had to call to chase this up. I work full time and I had to book a day off work for this. Booking time off work in my line of work (healthcare) at this time of the year is difficult enough. On the afternoon of the day before the boiler service was due I received a call cancelling my appointment. The next available date offered to me was 2 months away. After speaking to a rather unhelpful customer service representative, I managed to bring this down to a month. Suffice to say that a routine boiler service is costing me two days off work in a time when my workplace is under such an enormous pressure. My boiler is working fine but I have noticed the dial on one of the controls being in the red. I was relying on this visit to get this back into the green. I have had a boiler broken before because I attempted to ""fix"" it and I am naturally apprehensive to endeavour to fix things myself.  Every time I had a boiler service in the past, it has not taken longer that 10 minutes, even on my old 15 years old boiler. I will most certainly not going to renew with them Frankly, if it was not going to cost me, I would have left mid contract. If this is the service I receive for a routine boiler service, I wonder what it will be like for a real issue."
14/01/2024,01/01/2024,they are reliable.,this company is quick to respond and they always send the best engineers out  who are very friendly and helpful..i just needed a pressure valve repaired.unfortunately  the price is so high i will have to cancel it next year a £95 is too much excess to keep the price a little lower. Next year i will just call in a local heating engineer. that is not an 'insurance'.

This rather undermined the need for the insurance.

Initial emergency visit and a misdiagnosis, before finally mending, and this is the reason for 3 stars.Shaun, the engineer for 4 visits, did all he could, kept me informed of progress, and let me know ahead of time when he would arrive. He couldn't have been more apologetic for the length of time the repair took, but it turned out to be an unusual fault, and difficulties sourcing parts. I would give Shaun himself 5 stars."
16/01/2024,01/01/2024,Mithering calls,The company have badgered me to leave a review but I only went online to choose this service when i received 2 phone calls taking over the booking and offering 10 per cent off.That's all I can say
16/01/2024,01/01/2024,Long time frame,Engineer was knowledgeable and kept me informed about how the boiler was performing. My only criticism is that we are given a very long frame for the visit (8am to 6pm) which ties you up for the whole day.
16/01/2024,01/01/2024,Doesn’t stack up,"For me, 24/7 wasn’t worth the money. I had a policy for over 3 years and never claimed - when the time finally came, they weren’t able to get someone over quickly. Given I had no heating, and a small child at home, I called around to find someone locally. It cost me £150 to get a local plumber to come out on the same day, but given 24/7 Home Rescue costs £41 per month, you’re paying £492 per year. You need 3 breakdowns to make that stack up and you need to be confident that they can actually deliver quickly in an emergency situation (hence the name). They didn’t for me. Additionally, customer service is painful. I spent 28 minutes on the phone trying to cancel. They offered me a bunch of minor incentives to change my mind, like £40 credit, £30 towards a temporary electric heater and £5 off my monthly fee etc.They also told me I’d have to pay expensive fees if I cancelled - I had my terms to hand, so I could rebuff that easily, but for someone caught unprepared, they’d be forgiven for aborting the cancellation under the threat of fictitious fees. I guess you can’t fault them for trying.Just as I thought I had finally finished cancelling, I was transferred over to the team leader, who spent a good 10 minutes trying to explain to me that if I canceled 24/7 Home Rescue, I would have to pay somebody else money if ever my boiler broke, but with 24/7 Home Rescue, I wouldn’t… (except the £492 per year… right). She was also particularly forceful in telling me why I was wrong. Finally, about 5 mins after I reported my issue I got an unsolicited sales call, presumably from a different department - unbelievably they tried to sell me a new boiler. He started off by saying “I know you’ve had trouble with your boiler and we couldn’t get a someone over”… he asked my boiler age etc - I thought he was trying to resolve my issue and get someone over faster…. until he proceeded with his sales pitch - 🤦🏻Lordy Lordy"

No time given of call back, I just have to wait for a call, so inconvenient and unprofessional. There boiler service was what I would class as a check, they wanted extra to add inhibitor and extra to empty my magnet filter. So they just check there was no leak. Certainly don't recommend them and can't wait to leave. Trying to get anywhere with this company really effect my MH as they make things so difficult"

He's product knowledge and customer awareness was impeccable. Nice to know that you have a direct customer service number to call. I cannot exude much higher an appreciation for the level of exemplary service I experienced. Well done to all at 24/7, especially Syed Ali.In a world that is so deeply entrenched in a mindset of bottom line stats and profits, that good service normally takes the back seat, it was a breath of fresh air to feel those good old values of being, well, valued as a customer and not just a stat. When people take a genuine interest in your needs as a customer and tailoring a package that is not superfluous and hiked, we customers are more willing to choose you and shake on business. And, after a lengthy call duration, due to the excellent service received, I indeed, did not hesitate to give 24/7 my business. Finally, a big well-done again to all at 24/7.!! I will review again to see if the service is endemic and not just a one off wonder."

Since then the boiler pressure has always fallen eventually registering zero and no matter how I tried to fill it, this never worked. I therefore had to ask for an engineer to come and rectify the problem. I then had to pay an upfront charge of £95 being the ""excess"". The engineer came and spent 10 mins messing with something - no spare parts needed etc and suddenly all is fine. I could probably have done whatever it was myself yet now am out of pocket by £95 which was probably more than if I'd asked a local heating expert to come out and sort for me! Not happy at all and feel that this ""excess"" on every single call out is far too high. Going to cancel this cover as it's really not worth it in my opinion."

I did call them when it was getting close to midday and was advised that an engineer will definitely be there before 12pm. A fine example of a company overpromising and under delivering.

24/01/2024,01/01/2024,Rip off company,"Unfortunately the company picks and chooses what part it will replace which was not stated at the beginning of taking the insurance. The service was done stating no problem. Breakdown happens and I am to be charged for a part. How do you cover a boiler but not all of its parts? This is just a way of making customers pay extra. Be careful, even the parts when ordered through them takes weeks to arrive leaving you without heating or hot water. And ontop of it all, the premiums nearly doubled.PS: you just replied asking for my policy/ref no.  Do i send it here or want it over the phone? Not that I have any hope of anything getting done about it as your customer representative that we have been speaking to is not assisting but keeps repeating that the part isnt covered. As said, a boiler should be covered with all its components."

I am going to report to trading standards so many similar pattens of fraudulent business activities. They dont fulfil their part of the service, do some research on company on other review sites same common complaints. No different to email scams. Stick to locals"

25/01/2024,01/01/2024,Proof is in the Pudding - AVOID,"Had been with 24/7 for many years, used them every year for boiler service. This was a pain each year as they subcontract all the work out so can't tell you when it will be or control it. This year's service was rearranged 3 times on me.This year was the first that I had to use them for a boiler breakdown, the experience was awful, they again subcontracted out the work, but the subcontractor didn't send the worksheet to them for ages, all 24/7 could tell me was ""we will contact you within 24hrs"" - nobody ever contacted me back, I had to call and each time was told ""we need 24hrs"" finally got to the end of my tether as the 24hr thing was a lie; Nobody in this company will ever contact you as promised.My family and I were without heating or hot water for 2 weeks due to the inefficiency of 24/7 and their subcontractors. I have then received my renewal quote - this time it's far more expensive than a new business quote. I advise them I don't want to renew due to cost and experience, and all I get is offers of reduced premium. I had to reiterate 3 times my clear intention to leave before the message got through.I will be more than happy to never deal with this company again. I cannot recommend these to anyone either, please go to a local company or a bigger company who control their own workers."

I received an email advising me that the policy has renewed for double the price! I spoke to them yesterday and was advised I received a renewal invite to say its on auto renew!! told them to cancel as it is fraud to take my money when I have clearly told them not to, they have now cancelled but will not refund a months premium, I am fuming and will definitely take this further.What a patronising reply !! just typical of a company such as yours."

Then couldn’t get out of house fast enough. Wasn’t in long, so don’t even know if he did full service. Did quick wipe of sink, as had some muck on. A day later, realised, he had been sick in sink. I had missed some of mixer tap, when I cleaned. It smelt strong of sick. Too late for me, I picked up virus, he had. I was ill for 2 weeks. Lost 12lbs. If only he had told me he was sick, would have used a lot of bleach immediately. I was offered £20 as compensation, as had no evidence (really). Not impressed at all."
25/01/2024,01/01/2024,Use this company with caution,"The engineer turned up to service our boiler, he declared it was “live” the casing, pipes and our bathroom taps. He then left leaving electricity and gas still on with a potentially very dangerous situation. 24/7 wouldn’t send an electrician out as they claimed this wasn’t covered under the policy which was only for breakdown and emergency, surely this situation with a “live” boiler and “live” gas was an emergency situation?Independent  electrician and heating engineer declared no issues and that the fuse would have tripped .I don’t know why we were told what we were, but we were left in a potentially dangerous situation and no paperwork to support the “live” claims.Please be cautious about using this company"
26/01/2024,01/01/2024,POOR SERVICE,"I have been with a contract paying £12.91 a month and an annual boiler service is included in this. Firstly I was booked for a service on 24th November 2023, and then the day before I had a text message saying “Appointment booked for tomorrow, engineer will contract you within the hour” and then on the SAME Day of that text message I have a voicemail and a text saying it has been cancelled by you, saying “unforeseen circumstances”. So I rang you up saying I need to rebook as you guys cancelled on me. So it was RESCHEDULED for 26th Jan 2024 (today of complaint) Yesterday (25th Jan 24)  I had the same text saying about the engineer coming tomorrow and YET AGAIN a few moments later you cancel on me for the second time! It is ridiculous, I rang you up yesterday and spoke to someone to tell me that you guys are not taking bookings at the moment. But my policy will end on the 31st January 2024.It is ridiculous how this company is. Poor service."

I explained i wasn't a plumber and they still said i wasn't covered as it is a tap! I couldn't warn people off this company more. There is always an excuse to not come out. Avoid like the plague"

27/01/2024,01/01/2024,AVOID THIS COMPANY!!,AVOID THIS COMPANY!!Had the boiler cover with my24/7 for 4 years and always booked the annual service which always amazed me that they could fully service in the time they was here! Booked for this year's service and engineer arrived not having a clue how to use the tado system which is one of the popular WiFi heating controllers so didn't have much confidence right from the off.  Within 5 minutes of him there the boiler had mysteriously packed up and wasn't working at all. Even tho the boiler had been working perfectly fine all year and was working as he managed to get a emissions reading from it. He then said he couldn't do no more and left! Leaving me with no heating with a family with children isn't very good at all.  Couple of days after I get a call saying that they will send out a service engineer only after I've paid £75! I begrudgingly paid up and waited a day for him to turn up. He turned up not happy that he had to work on Sunday and couldn't wait to get to the pub! Told me boiler was beyond economical repair and left again with no heating in the coldest spell we've had this year!! To say my house and kids was freezing is a understatement! Finally 9 days after it stopped working on a so called service and me having to chase them all the time they finally say they can't do anything and cancel my contract with them!! Now stuck with a dead boiler that I've now got to sort out.   Over the year they have bombarded me with phone calls trying to get me to upgrade my ageing boiler with the same response that if its working fine im leaving alone.  This company will only want to take all your money and help out the least they can !!! I would highly recommend using other company's for your heating system as these are a complete waste of money

My living room spot lights started to drip water really badly and on my own not knowing what to do I was terrified. It took me ages to get through only to be told that if I could not identify where the leak was myself, my insurance would not cover this. All of the summary info and start of the policy did not mention this. Tucked away on page 10 under ‘trades and access’ there it was, they won’t find the problem? What- are you serious. Would never ever insure with this company again"

Once my period had lapsed I logged in to be informed that I could not have a service until August.Sorry - that is not what I was promised (check your telephone recording of our conversation).Called them.  Was told I could have on in 5 weeks but would need to pay an extra £30.Basically, I was lied to from the start.I have now cancelled and will go elsewhere.I cannot comment on their actually work, perhaps they are great, but for keeping to initial promises - AVOID."

The only downside is that it's not possible to book a service appointment - someone phones on the day when an engineer is in your area in case you can fit in a visit, which is a pain when you work full time.

31/01/2024,01/01/2024,I strongly advice you to steer clear of…,I strongly advice you to steer clear of this company.  I took out service for my combi boiler with them.  I paid monthly then when the boiler broke down on 14th January 2023 I had to pay a fee of £75 before they would agree to send an engineer.  I am 81 years old and was supposed to get priority treatment because of my age.  The engineer didn’t turn up for 2days.  This happened right at the beginning of that bitterly cold week we had mid January.  The engineer said the boiler needed a new fan and he would return later with that.  After 30 minutes I got a call from the company trying to sell me a new boiler. I quoted what the engineer had said about a new fan.  An hour later I got another call from them trying to sell me a boiler.  I stated quite categorically I didn’t want a new boiler because my current boiler only needed a new fan.  Later that day I got another call from said company stating the engineer would not be returning with a fan because the boiler didn’t warrant that expense (about £100).  They refused to refund my monthly payments or the £75 fee.  I got nothing at all for my money.  I subsequently purchased a new boiler - not from them of course.  I was without heat and water for a full week before the new boiler was installed.  Home Rescue couldn’t have cared less.  Do not under any circumstances give them your money.

31/01/2024,01/01/2024,Diabolical Service,"Complaint Reference: TF1087026Full Policy £26.99On the first November 2023 I called 24/7 as we had heavy rainfall and there was water leaking from the bottom of the boiler. An engineer came at 6pm in total darkness.  He was immediately rude stating this was his last job and he just wanted to get to the pub. I offered him tea or coffee and he was rude again stating he didn't drink that crap.  I offered him a torch as it was so dark but he didn't want one as he had his phone. I left him to it.  A few minutes later he came in and said he had cut a piece of pipe off and put it on my kitchen worktop.  He said the pipe was incorrectly installed and someone from the office would call me to sort out where we go from there.A couple of weeks later I saw that the drain the boiler pipe went into was overflowing.  I called the company and an engineer came and unblocked the drain. He stated that the pipe was blocked and that is why the water was coming out of the bottom of my boiler and if it hadn't of been dark the boiler engineer would have seen that.  I repeatedly called the company to find out what was being done about my pipework and was told three times that the job had been closed.  I was passed from one department to another and eventually in January 2024 I was told that nobody would be calling out as it was an ""incorrect installation"".I explained it was installed and maintained under the Worcester 7 year warranty and then has had the last two yearly maintenance certificates by a well known homecare company. So apparently there are 9 gas certified heating engineers that are not doing their jobs properly according to 24/7.  I asked to speak with a manager as I now have an independant quote for £140 bill to pay to repair the cut pipework, I spoke with four different people who appeared to just be reading from a script and not answering my direct questions  and they refused to pass me on to a manager.  I asked to terminate my contract and was told it was yet another department I needed to speak with.   Eventually I was told it would cost me £186 the chap then asked me to wait a moment and then came back saying I could terminate it for £135.  I said the £140 repair that I now had to pay because of their error  should be offset against the £135 to get me out of the contract.  He stated that this was not possible.  I asked once again to speak with a senior person.  I then received a telephone call offering me £30 compensation which obviously said I did not want as I no longer had any faith in the company.  I then received another telephone call the day after offering me £50 compensation, to which I declined.  I was then offered the £50 compensation as part of a reduction of the £186 contract exit fee.  I also received a letter offering the compensation with a detailed letter of my problem stating the dates November 2024 (REALLY).  The incompetencies within this company are outstanding.  Needless to say I have contacted the Worcester boiler company and am prepared to take this further."

An independent engineer has completed a riddor report about their concerns from what was found and cadent are in discussion about this as it’s the 2nd gas leak within 2 months since this company messed around with my boiler.They don’t do a tightness test so you’ll be unaware if you have a leak after the boiler is ‘serviced’ get a proper independent engineer who carries out all safety gas leak checks."

They charged me £250 to cancel it!!!!!!! Don't waste your money on insurance for your boiler,  rather get a gas engineer out to service it and if needed, repair... Will be a whole lot cheaper and sound!Reply: Your complaints team has already looked at it and deemed it ok... which is why I want everyone to know what you do!!!!"
01/02/2024,01/02/2024,Absolute cowboys,"Absolute cowboys. Engineer arrived to replace stopcock and fix boiler, I knew within 5 minutes he wasn't going to do either. Tried to blame stopcock for the reason the boiler wasn't working and said I wasn't covered for the stopcock so someone from the office would call. Complete fabrication as they tried to fix the stopcock before and obviously failed. Packed his tools up and left, big pool of water under the sink,  stopcock in bits and no working plumbing in the house whatsoever plus bits of the boiler on my worktop. What a bunch of jokers, cancelled cover and got proper Engineers put who fixed issue no problem. Avoid these losers."

01/02/2024,01/02/2024,24/7 rip off,24/7 call you while you are still in your cooling off period and ask if you are happy with the service. I responded saying I haven’t used the service. They then pressure you into leaving a trust pilot review while they wait on the phone to check you have done it. Once the policy is out of the cooling off period and you try to make a claim they tell you it is an existing fault and refuse to process the claim leaving you to pay for a policy that is worthless for a fault that was not existing before. The app is terrible to navigate so you are better of just calling them directly.

Left the property to the small leak turning into a big leak and cause the boiler to stop working!! This then turned into having no hot water or heating in freezing cold conditions to them sending another engineer out who confirmed that the fault was due to the leak not being fixed the first time. He then made a phone call and was told to leave the property and not fix the problem because it was going to cost £250!! Customer service not interested leaving me without water or heating with a small child for days!! No options given just a straight no but they will sell me a new boiler sorry but I don’t think so!!! I got a second opinion and they also confirmed my boiler was now not working due to the leak not being fixed!!! 24/7 this is not the end!! You had no compassion, no apology and you just didn’t care or even try to help.  Basically they didn’t want to fix it because they wanted to sell a new boiler.

Boiler was still not working and had to ask them to send back someone again. again 24 hour delay in sending someone and yet the issue isn't resolved. still waiting for a fix and my tenants are living without heat and hot water. the company said they would reimburse for portable heater but no sight of any reimbursement yet. terrible customer service and technical quality of people sent. Very unhappy with their service. Update as of 14th Feb, still having isssues with this company. they are now avoiding fixing my boiler and has picked up different clauses from the insurance document to deny any further claim. I will appeal now with ombudsman service."

So I chose this this company little that I know it’s the  worst out of all the other companies.  So I booked a gas safety check and a boiler service for the earliest appointment they could give me which was 10/1/24 which was cancelled  a day before. And was  reschedule for another day which was the 18/jan, I heard nothing from the company for about 10 days kept looking at their app and there’s no paperwork or cp12certificate or  a report from the engineer the only thing it shows job completed so I called the customer service and here where I I realised how bad is this company…. I was told the our engineer attended the job and he refused to carry out the work ⛔️⛔️…. (As he said that the gas meter is too close to the electric switch board) bear in mind this has been the case sines I bought the house (no one has touched the gas meter or moved it and so is the electric) and several  gas safety registered engineers including British Gas have been to service the boiler in the last 8-9 years never been an issue ….. so I asked for the failure report, which it should have been loaded to my account,  they refusing to give me any details for the engineer that attend the job not even his gas safety no . I have been in touch with gas safety themselves and I was advised that he shouldn’t have fail the check and should have flag it as advice. It’s been 3 weeks now since and the company failed to send paperwork. Been in touch with citizens advice and Trading standards to look in to this company and have been in touch with BBC so no one have to go through what I’m going through. So please avoid this company not sure if they use gas registered  engineers ⛔️⛔️⛔️. As I don’t see why they won’t give details."

I had a problem which they discovered while doing my service, which was not an existing problem. They told me the  item which was a pressure valve and said it would be £450 to replace and told it was a maintenance problem. What’s the point of having there top of the range cover.

However, with the next 2 issues they have given us nothing but difficulties.We have been loyal customers for 5 years and despite this have been told that as our dishwasher (that they are happy to insure) is broken and no longer available they will only give us a voucher that will not cover the entire cost of a new dishwasher.The people we speak to don't understand the policy enough to explain why and just say ""that's what I've been told"". Not good enough.To add to this the customer service with 24/7 (NOT the engineers who come out who are all lovely) is appalling. I've been put on hold then the call fail numerous times, having to call up multiple times a day as they cannot call me back when I've asked for it and a lot of the people not understanding what I am asking. (This has now been going on for 4 weeks).I would have hoped the company would have honoured their policy but they are trying to get out of giving us what we are owed."

07/02/2024,01/02/2024,Avoid,"Increased from 1 to 3 stars following 'resolution'. I'd still suggest looking elsewhere if you want reliable customer service. We have a 'comprehensive' cover plan with them (appliances, plumbing etc etc) but in the event they cannot fix a fault, they'll eventually force you to accept a derisory Curry's voucher to put towards a replacement. But to make things even worse they won't process that voucher with any urgency, oh no, you have to wait 7-10 days and after repeatably chasing them you get fobbed off with the same stock answer that 'it's with the accounts team' who you cannot possibly speak to. So frustrating. Final Update: After spending a disproportionate amount of my time chasing with multiple calls etc over a 3 1/2 week period, I have finally been sent the £300 Curry's voucher for a £600 appliance. Whilst the time taken to resolve this is not acceptable, or the value you place on my appliance, at least you did send through the voucher so some credit to 247 for that. I tried to encourage a better response by tagging/messaging 24/7 the issue on social media, and their response is to block me. Pathetic."

The first year they sent me a third party company's details for me to organise the appointment myself who not only never responded and was impossible to deal with but when eventually turned up run my hot water for over an hour as a part of the ""servicing"", and failed to carry out my boiler service eventually.  The 24/7 boiler service team who eventually had to come out to service my boiler was good, but unfortunately this year I am facing the same issues and it's impossible to get my boiler serviced because they are so incredibly understaffed. I had an appointment for January which was cancelled by them due to illness, then they couldn't provide me with an appointment for a long time saying they haven't got any slots in their calendar? Like for the whole year? I am speachless.I have asked many times to put me on a cancellation list, they called me 20 mins before arrival if I am home. I wasn't as I was at work, and this is frustrating. Not to mention that they have called me about 12 times to try to sell some cleaning solution - when the engineer never even reached my premises. This is my second year with this company definitely looking for a new company boiler insurance for next year."

They were quick to collect our £95 excess/callout charge, but since the problem turned out to be a leaking hot water tank, we weren't covered and the £95 got us precisely nothing. We're looking at a bill of more than £1,000 for a repair which would have been covered if we hadn't tried to save money by switching away from British Gas's expensive but comprehensive policy a few months ago!I might add that 247's offshored call centre is infuriating, repeatedly asking you the same security questions, even when they're ringing you. They were much keener on taking our callout payment and repeatedly asking about parking than on helping."

Unfortunately sometimes later I had an issue with my boiler which led to lack of heating and warm water. I contacted these guys and explained my difficult situation and promised to get me an engineer as soon as possible. Oh my God these people are clooks  they simply charged me the access fee and left with no heating and no warm water. Eventually this so called engineer walked in and no proper diagnostic carried out, opened my boiler and five minutes left and said that a message was forwarded to 24/7 . He said that he will come back once authorised to order the part.No contact from them there after and I made a complaint about their lack of customer service and inappropriate behaviour towards clients. I was then surprised to speak to this guy who explained that my boiler had been declared BER( Beyond economic repair) therefore it was my responsibility to pay for a full repair or replace with a new one.He then offered to sell me a new one with the price which I have never heard about ithe cost of a boiler and offered to use a finance to pay over time.I simply cancelled the policy and left them with my access cost and all monthly payments made before Please if any one is looking for a boiler cover never consider 24/7 .

13/02/2024,01/02/2024,As a customer of 247 homerescue Gas…,"As a customer of 247 homerescue Gas Company, I've unfortunately encountered numerous issues that have left me deeply dissatisfied with their services. It's important to note that their offices and call center are located in Pakistan, which often leads to significant communication barriers and frustrating experiences.First and foremost, the technical support provided by 247 Gas Company is severely lacking. The representatives seem to have minimal understanding of technical issues, leading to prolonged wait times on the phone and an infuriating game of passing customers from one department to another. It's incredibly frustrating to deal with individuals who cannot provide meaningful assistance or resolve issues in a timely manner.Furthermore, the gas engineers employed by 247 Gas Company appear to be inexperienced and, in some cases, dishonest. Instead of providing genuine solutions, they often attempt to find faults that can be used as leverage to pressure landlords into expensive repairs. This unethical behavior not only damages trust but also creates unnecessary financial burdens for customers.The complaints department is equally disappointing, displaying a complete lack of understanding regarding the concept of ""the customer is always right."" Instead of addressing valid concerns, they seem more inclined to dismiss them, leaving tenants in the cold without proper resolution or compensation.Additionally, despite being marketed as a budget-friendly option, 247 Gas Company's premiums have increased substantially without any justifiable reason. In fact, their prices have surpassed even those of larger, more reputable companies like British Gas. This price hike, coupled with their abysmal service quality, makes them a poor choice for anyone seeking reliable gas services.In conclusion, I strongly advise avoiding 247 Gas Company at all costs. While they may offer cheaper rates initially, the subpar customer service, lack of technical expertise, and questionable business practices make them a truly regrettable choice. Save yourself the headache and invest in a more reputable gas provider that values its customers and delivers on its promises."

14/02/2024,01/02/2024,Boiler service and now not working!,"Booked an annual boiler service only for the central heating system not to work after the engineer had left!  He came back later the same day and said we should have a power flush which would cost £599.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with the boiler (or radiators) prior to him undertaking a service so I find it very hard to understand why a power flush is needed  (and he could not guarantee it would solve the problem).  Surely it was something he did to the boiler that made it suddenly not work.  He was constantly on the phone asking more senior engineers what he should do.  Requested second opinion and engineer booked to attend tomorrow.  Got a call weeks before the service pushing for us to have this power flush and then got two further calls on the day of the service recommending this power flush. I wish I had never booked the annual service as there was nothing wrong with the central heating system! Hopefully the new engineer will be able to sort this out.Update: New engineer found that some valves under the sink area had not been turned back on - so problem solved thanks goodness and power flush not required.The response from the admin team was very good when he came to rebooking an engineer so from a communication and customer service point of view, 24/7 has been excellent.  Just wish they would keep pushing to sell you a power flush even though it is not necessary."

Engineer visit was booked for Tuesday 13th February. On the morning of 13th February, I received a call 30 minutes prior to the engineer arriving. He arrived on time, was respectful of my white carpets by putting on shoe covers and then did a thorough job of finding the fault with the boiler, and fixing it all in one visit as he had the parts in his van.  I was only without heating and hot water for two days so I am really impressed with how quickly I was booked in and how knowledgeable and efficient the engineer was in fixing my boiler. Would recommend 24/7 Home Rescue, this is my second year signed up with them and the first time I have had to call them out so I am happy with the service and that everything went smoothly."

Got refunded one month as compensation but empathy just eager to close the complaint. Sent engineer and said boiler is beyond economical repair. Pushed to go for a new boiler or a repair on my own expense which is bizarre because that's why iv got the insurance (total scam) had an independent company come check it out and they got the part and fitted within 15-20 mins and all done the same day calling them. Part is less than £100 online and I got told there cost would be £350 plus! For a 15 min fitting job? Absaloutly livid! Have asked to speak with cancellation. This is my second negative experience! It's not worth it they have lots of exclusions which ends up costing silly amounts! Avoid at all Costs. It was a simple job and fear mongering and extorting extortionate prices was just terrible! Read reviews on other sites and you will see the same thing over and over again! I gave the company benefit of the doubt but totally reckless and expensive! I hope my experience isn't replicated with other customers.NB reply : they have forceably cancelled my contract now. Despite giving me 2 options to go with due to boiler not working. I had a full cover not just boiler and they have emailed me that the contract is cancelled with ""immediate effect"" iv asked for T and Cs where there allowed to cancel it without any discussion despite having a full home cover (not just boiler).

And registered with 247 as a vulnerable person (age).I experienced a problem which caused the sockets fuse on the fusebox to trip, and not reset. I called 247 for help on morning of Friday 9 February and described the symptoms. 247 offered to send out an electrician to have a look at the problem for £95 call out fee. Before the engineer arrived on the Saturday I had worked out by elimination that the problem was in a circuit related to the heating system and so had turned off the related isolating switch, and the rest of the electrics worked again.When the electrician appeared, he said he could not find any faults and that I would need a heating engineer, and left. 10 minutes after he left, I could smell electrical burning around the area where the plumbing electrics were. So I isolated the heating circuit again and called 247 (on the Saturday after I semelled the burning) with more details of the problem, and that a heating engineer was needed, as well as an electrician who would review the problem properly...247 said they needed to collect a £95 call out fee before they would send a plumber, during the next week sometime. I paid again, and explained that I was still without heating... so a plumber and an electrician were booked to attend my property on the following Tuesday.The electrician arrived on Tuesday and identified the problem as a faulty Honeywell 2 port valve for the heating. This valve had been replaced by 247 less than 6 months ago. The heating engineer arrived within an hour later and agreed that the 2 port valve was faulty, and that he would need to report this back to 247 for them to decide what to do.I called 247 on Wednesday and Thursday (yesterday) to ask what was happening with getting the problem resolved and get my heating back on...and was told that they were waiting for engineers reports, and waiting for quotes for repairs.Got a call from 247 today saying that I would need to pay £200+ to get the system drained down to complete the repairs - and I have had to pay upfront before they try to source and engineer .... so 8 days without heat later, I am waiting on an appointment to get repairs completed ... so sometime next week....Spectactularly unimpressed... will not be renewing with 247!From 247...""...24-Hour AvailabilityOur claims helpline is always open.

My gas cooker lid's safety feature stopped working, and so their gas man cut and capped the physical gas connection from behind, to an unreasonably low height. Any reasonable person would have simply disconnected the cooker and made it safe. Instead, their amateur work resulted in an extra £150 for me to get the cooker connection re-piped.When I cancelled this year, they also still took an annual payment out of my account despite having notice of cancellation for over 2 weeks.

We initially received no service record, or confirmation of the tasks carried out. We had asked for a system inhibitor to be installed, but again no record of if that task was carried out?Furthermore to this, and the main issue, since the engineer left the house was the boiler not in working condition. Thus, we were left with no heating or hot water, in the midst of winter and a 1 year old in the house also. The engineer was effectively just in a rush to leave the property and did not ensure the boiler was in a working order, which is absolutely scandalous. The boiler was in a working order beforehand and he had just ‘passed’ the service.They did sent another engineer out around 36 hours later and he said it was a loose connector and rectified the issue, however the same issue has returned 2 months later. This isn’t the type of experience you’d expect on the back of a service. Based on the initial service by 247 Home Rescue I have had with yourselves, I certainly will not be recommending yourselves to any family, friends or colleagues."

Very knowledgeable and thorough with his inspection, talking through what he was doing and why whilst also explaining that things would soon be changing with boilers etc..

22/02/2024,01/02/2024,Proceed with caution,"I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel compelled to share my recent appalling experience with 24/7 home rescue. After a routine boiler service, they flagged my boiler as ""at risk,"" insisting that I needed an immediate replacement of the heat exchanger due to a broken part. This claim was particularly suspicious, considering they had been servicing my boiler for the past three years without any prior issues.They quoted a staggering £900 for the replacement, despite admitting that the fault would have occurred during their own service. Outraged, I contested their assessment, demanding further investigation. Eventually, after many telephone calls, they begrudgingly sent out the boiler manufacturer for a second opinion, only to discover that the supposedly defective part was perfectly fine.This ordeal exposed not only their incompetence but also their blatant disregard for customer satisfaction. I shudder to think about the vulnerable individuals, like the elderly or those unable to advocate for themselves. They would have needlessly forked out a substantial sum for a repair that wasn't even necessary.The lack of accountability and empathy exhibited by 24/7 boiler service is utterly unacceptable. I implore anyone considering their services to proceed with extreme caution. Trusting them with your boiler maintenance could lead to unnecessary expenses and undue stress. Avoid them at all costs, and spare yourself the headache of dealing with their shocking customer service.Complaint Reference Number: HR1088800"

23/02/2024,01/02/2024,I am seeking guidance as I am…,"I am seeking guidance as I am experiencing high levels of stress and frustration. I’m not the person who complains but this is getting serious now.In August I have taken landlord home rescue insurance. I have  adviced that as A&e nurse, I may not always be available to promptly respond to phone calls for claims and approvals for my tenant. After the reassurance that  my tenant has been authorised, I have opted for the premium insurance coverage to ensure peace of mind and a smooth process.On January 29th , I had a boiler service. The gas engeneer informed me that he would be turning off the boiler and marking it as risky due to a flu that was not completely sealed on both sides , (there is a gap between the wall and the flue). He explained that this could potentially lead to a CO2 leak back into the property, causing issues. I asked the technician on site if he could repair the necessary work ( that he can issue me an invoice and I will pay for problem to be fixed) and he mentioned that he was not authorized to do so. He advised me to contact the call center, and they would send another engineer to address the issue.On January 30th, I contacted the 24/7 call center and was informed that even this is emergency, my emergency coverage does not cover this work and that a third-party engineer would need to be found, which could take up to two days. After calling again after 2 days I was being told they were still searching for an engineer, I became concerned about enduring three days without hot water and electricity in the cold weather. Consequently, I decided to seek out a private engineer for assistance hoping to fix problem quicker. The call center had no objection and advised me that once the work is completed, I should contact them again so that a qualified engineer can return to the property to service the boiler.Regrettably, I had to travel overseas and my phone's roaming  was not functioning. My tenant have been attempting to communicate with 24/7 , but he was saying that I must speak to them in order to obtain authorization. Consequently, I have sent four emails urgently requesting an emergency visit, as the property still lacks hot water and heating.On February 15th, upon my arrival, I placed a phone call which was subsequently transferred to three different departments. I was given assurance that within 24 hours, an engineer would contact me regarding the appointment details. No one contacted me.On February 16th, 34 hours later, I called again and obtained the job ID. Once more, I was assured that someone would reach out to me within 24 hours. Unfortunately, I wasn’t contacted.On February 17th I contacted the 24/7  and I was informed me  he needs to place it as a new request since there was no record of a previous one.!Additionally, after one week of my written request for portable heaters as outline in my premium policy, he advised me to purchase the heater myself and submit the receipt.Furthermore, I had made a request to be contacted regarding a complaint by either complaint  team or the supervisor.On Monday, February 19th 12:56, I missed a phone call. I called back after just two minutes, and followed the given voicemail instructions. This led me back to the call center and I was given a new date for engeneer appointment on the 22nd. Once again, I was informed that a new request had to be made for a callback.Consequently, on Wednesday, February 21st, I received a phone call, but due to work commitments, I was unable to answer.Therefore, on Thursday the 22nd, I called again and requested a new callback. On the 23rd, in the evening my tenant confirms that engeneer attended, and that he had to cut off the gas pipe to the boiler.So I call 24/7  trying to find out what happened  but I was informed that it was outside of working hours and there was nothing that could be done. I was advised to wait for the report to be reviewed and for a callback.I am growing increasingly desperate and unsure of what steps to take regarding my tenant's living conditions. It is concerning to see them relying on portable heaters and a kettle for their basic needs.I was unable to get my enquiries sorted via 24/7 mobile app as chat bot is automatic and I wasn’t offer to chat with live advisor ; neither I was able to log in new claim request.I acknowledge that I missed two phone calls and I appreciate text messages expressing apologies for the negative experience resulting from the phone calls feedback. Regrettably, this does not resolve the issue with the heating and hot water.Is there any regulatory bodies that could provide guidance in this matter?Thanking you in advance for any guidance "

23/02/2024,01/02/2024,Avoid this scam company,"Avoid this scam company! Go to other review sites and see the truth about them. I did a service and repair completed last year by this company. I could explain all issues that occurred last time but its pointless. Just be be aware of terms and conditions. This company gets you by delaying its service requirements till a few months into your policy. Then when an engineer is sent to service your boiler, it will not be completed because an issue will highlighted which will abort the service. Now you need to pay for the repair which will not be covered by the policy and worse if you cancel the policy you have to pay a big fee. So according to their terms a call out was made and thus you are liable to their huge cancellation fee. In effect your monthly fees paid so far and cancellation fee or repair cost depending upon your choice will be more than your annual policy cost. So its no loss to them either way. But for you there is no service certificate completed and you need to pay for any repairs before your policy is valid. My boiler is perfectly fine and i would rather cancel my policy than to continue with a company i cannot trust anymore. Will return to my previous company who were only a little more in monthly premiums but so much more professional."

23/02/2024,01/02/2024,Avoid this company,My partner took out boiler and central heating cover with this company. An actuator valve broke recently and needed replaced. The repair man came to take a look and said the part needed replaced. A couple of days later the call centre phoned to say the part was included in our cover but the system needed a full drain to install the part and that wasn't covered and would cost £180.We asked if the repair man could call us back to discuss this and the call centre told us to expect a call in a couple of days and we never heard anything from them.Thankfully I had a friend to ask for a second opinion and he said the system did not need draining at all and I ordered the part and he installed it in ten minutes. This company are clearly trying to charge for things not covered in their plans to make extra money from their customers. Promptly cancelled our cover and will be sticking to local tradesmen from now on.

At the beginning of this winter 2023 my central heating wasn’t coming on and it took me 2 weeks of battle with 24/7 operators to send an engineer in . when the engineer from the Navien boiler did come though his work was spot on and he fixed the problem and we have the heating working really well. However the Navien boiler engineer requested 24/7 for the annual service to be done and again after much struggle I got an appointment a month later in December for it to be cancelled 2 days before the appointment as 24/7 was short staffed. Service still not done February 2024.And now since last Wednesday I am struggling with no hot water from the boiler … I called 24/7 they asked me to call Navien boiler I called Navien boiler they say they won’t come until 24/7 shows them that the service is done.. between the companies internal departments I am still struggling as a customer to get my boiler fixed by 24/7 for hot water.  Appalling level of Customer service. I had to try out a diy of switching the boiler off for 2 days use my parents hot water facilities instead . I switched the boiler back on yesterday Sunday and just about getting lukewarm water to do the washing ups etc… today Monday , still struggling for hot water and still in numerous calls with 24/7 to get this sorted. It is indeed my bad experience . Hence sharing with others on trustpilot in hope that no other customers are experiencing such bad service and I hope new customers are treated better. "

27/02/2024,01/02/2024,Taking money even though not a customer,"Had the most infuriating call with a guy that was not understanding anything I was trying to say, but kept telling me I’m a customer. I had a contract with 24|7 home rescue probably 5 years ago maybe more, but I didn’t renew the contract and I joined British Gas instead. Now since 2018 to 2023 I have not paid a penny to this company, obviously because I am not a customer. However, a month or so ago I get a call from an engineer to say he is outside my house for my boiler service (very dodgy). I told my parents not to answer the door because we haven’t booked anything so my parents literally locked themselves in the house all day. They take a payment out of £39 in January (why do they still have my account details on their system is very dodgy as well). I went to the bank and cancelled the payment and told them it’s fraudulent activity. I received a message this morning saying they have reinstated my direct debit. I called them company, the guy asked me for my policy number ( i don’t have because i’m not a customer). I kept telling him I can provide him proof that no money has been taken out my account, he kept telling me i have been paying. He also said the engineer entered my property for a service, i told him i have camera’s around my house i can provide proof that no engineer entered my house. He kept telling me my contract has been renewed and I have been a customer since 2018. What clearly has seemed to have happened is whoever took my call however many years ago cancelled my payments but didn’t register on their system that i was not a customer anymore. But now reinstated a direct debit payment in January 2024. I asked the guy a simple question ‘if my contract was renewed in October 2023 should I have not be paying every month’ and he said yes. I said to him if he can give me a email address i can provide him with proof of nothing being paid to their account. I had to hang up the phone on him because the solution he gave me was a lower premium price of £22 a month. I have reported this to my bank and would be expecting my refund for January’s payment. "

I have refused to renew my policy, this seemed to get their attention a lot more than repairing my boiler did. They even offered a discount on the price to maintain my custom. When I told them I wouldn’t take the renewal even if it was free, they answered “we can’t do it for free”. I think that really sums up this ramshackle company. Do yourself a favour and avoid like the plague!"

I believe they don't record the customer's rating if they give them a lower review. I tried several times.  When I gave a higher score it was recorded. That's one way of getting good reviews!PS Didn't turn up! Now it's the 1st March.Engineer came no sockets with him. So couldn't do the job.

They should call it the toilet blockage cover. I asked them for a refund but found out they renewed the contract when I asked them not to and this has been going on for sometime.

The policy covers boiler service, I pay for full cover boiler , drainage, electric. I use there app drop down box. Pipe behind sink leaking with easy access. Not covered, I ask to cancel with 14 days notice & they want £135. When I’ve called them out they don’t turn up & use the excuse I didn’t answer my phone. When I question that they told me the engineer had emergency?if I wasn’t home I would of been fined £30, I’ve waited in 2 times & been told I didn’t answer my phone? As all the other reviews says good job on boiler service that is all there good for & what you pay your money missleading £34.99 a month?"

I was assured by the engineer that I would receive a call when they were ordered and for him to come back to fix the boiler. Lo and behold I had waited 6 weeks and heard absolutely nothing. As it was coming up to the the renewal anyway it had made my mind up that I wasn’t going to renew with them. So I cancelled the policy as it was no longer needed and informed the company by calling them, with the renewal price being expensive also. 4 weeks before the renewal took place, I found better anyway, 5 months down the line this company is still constantly pestering and bombarding me with texts and emails to get me to renew. This is after being told I would no longer receive any correspondence from them. Terrible company.From now on until the pestering and bombarding of texts and emails stops I will keep giving a review on here every single time. "

06/03/2024,01/03/2024,An update on my previous post:,"An update on my previous post:I called to say that our heating was making a noise only to be told that they do not come out unless the system is not working.A week or so later the heating did not work and boiler was showing a fault code, so I called again.  The guy told me to turn off at the mains and this seemed to work but said someone would come out.  The system working and making the noise was intermittent and when the engineer came out it was working fine.  I told him the fault was intermittent and told him the fault codes that showed on the boiler.  He hardly looked at the boiler and the pump, said that as it’s working then he couldn’t do anything. This cost me £75 excess.However after he went it stopped again so I called out an independent engineer.  Straight away he diagnosed the fault (even though system was working again when he arrived).  He took off the pump and cleaned it out and the system is now working properly and no noise.Basically it’s cost me £75 excess for nothing.I put a note of complaint on your site and you also said on your reply here that you would get back to me.  I still haven’t heard anything.  Not impressed.Latest 18/3/2024As above I’m still waiting for the reply from your complaints department and a reply to the note I put on your web site More latest 2/4/2024You stated in your reply that you would refer to your complaints team and get back to me.  I’m still waiting.  I also put comments on your web site that you have ignored.I would avoid this company. "

Difficult to get boiler service. When I called 2 months earlier before the boiler service was due, the staff said I had to call in the month before the due date. When I called 1 month before the due date, I could not get the service as they said they were very busy. And the slot they give is an open slot like the whole day, which means you have to stand by the whole day.  When I wanted to cancel my policy, they tried to convince me to stay and offer a break, but then I decided to cancel, I still had to pay another month to cancel. I accepted it but when the time they did direct debit, I was double charged. They promised to do a refund but did not. Be careful when its time to cancel your policy. They are cheater. "

The problem still hasn't been fixed, and asked for £95 a third time. So today she's tried to cancel, and they now say, it's £40 to leave.The company is an absolute joke.They had her sit in all day for an engineer who didn't show up either.And didn't even apologise about the situation. When I get the time I will be going to Trading Standards and The FCA.You complain to them on the phone, and they do nothing about it. Just after money, and wasting your time.

I was then told 5th March 2024 was the next available date, this was over 5 months since being told I needed a boiler service!

10/03/2024,01/03/2024,Problem with 24/7 cover,"We have a fault on our Vaillant boiler that says there is a pressure problem (F.75). It will run for an unpredictable amount of time and then raise the fault again.  A reset will start it again. The boiler is pressurised in the correct range (1.7 bar) so I know that can be excluded, which leaves the pressure sensor or a boiler pump fault. Because the problem is not “persistent”, in other words, not technically fully broken down, it is not covered by the policy. I was told that if an engineer was to be sent and the boiler was working on arrival, the engineer would leave and my £75 excess would be forfeited. Understandably, I am not happy and wish I had stayed with Corgi, but they wanted 3x the monthly cost, albeit with no excess. I guess if it was to fail completely I would be covered, but I don’t know if that is going to happen, leaving me with having to reset the boiler at random intervals!!! Looks like I will be finding an engineer I can trust and deciding whether I want to cancel the policy.Update 11th March 2024I tried to trigger the fault while watching the boiler, but only succeeded in getting it into the pressure danger zone of 3.2 bar (the max recommended is 3), at which point I turned it off. Pressure release valve and/or expansion chamber problem? No sign of water being ejected to lower the pressure, which is worrying.After this review went live I had a phone call from the Complaints Resolution team. However, after being passed to the Claims Team yet again I still wasn’t sure if an engineer would come to investigate and fix what is an obvious problem.Now I have escalated the issue.It seems that I have to pay the excess to get an engineer out to investigate and pass on the details of the problem, if one is discovered, which will then be evaluated by the technical team to see if anything will be done under the contract or I pay to get it fixed.Update 12th MarchA local company engineer arrived and diagnosed the problem immediately. He replaced the pressure sensor and filled the empty expansion chamber. No external authorisation needed. Sorted.After all the hassle and days lost trying to get it fixed, I have lost all confidence in 24/7 being able to handle a problem effectively. I will continue to use the local company. So no more answering the same question multiple times on the same call and being told that I said something I hadn’t, and no more explaining why the questions I was being asked made no sense, eg “how many times in a day does the boiler exceed the maximum pressure?”. As I don’t watch the pressure gauge 24/7 how am I supposed to answer that question? As the Call Centre is in India is it that they don’t need or use central heating and really have no idea what they are supposedly supporting? No obvious local technical support backup either.I cancelled the contract."

I had to call the Emergency every single day for a follow-up and Eventually, I had to hire a private pest control company at my own expense. Unfortunately, the company subcontracted by 24/7 Home Rescue to handle the job in Kent proved to be highly ineffective in attending to the property."

The repair could not be completed on the first visit as my cistern needed to be removed and the engineer didn’t have the bolts to replace the rusty ones that needed to be hacksawed off. He returned 2 days later and replaced the flush system and the float valve. Communication via text was good throughout. Considering I only pay £6.99 a month I thought the service was good, even with a £45 excess"

He spent time checking, reviewing and servicing the boiler.  He found that there was a small leak which was effecting the water gauge on the boiler which leads to having to fill the boiler up every few weeks.  James called and ordered the part.   Partly my fault for not checking with 247 but realised that no one every came back to repair.  I spoke to the Habib in customer service who said the order was not placed and would have to start a new claim with me having to pay an excess fee.  With that in mind and the delayed timeframe I would cancel the policy.  Habib spent time communicating with his Manager which resolved in wavering the fee and arranging an appointment for this Thursday 14 March to rectify the problem.  If it was not for Habib being so helpful I would seriously have cancelled the policy.  So please be made aware that you have a fabulous customer service colleague who is professional, helpful and goes above and beyond.  I do  hope he receives some remuneration for his services. "

13/03/2024,01/03/2024,Two things wrong....,"Two things. Firstly, our Carbon Monoxide alarm sounded so we called the emergency (not 247) number. They came in 20 mins and confirmed no leak of Co2 but said they were required to cap the meter so the boiler could be checked for leaks.  Fine.  So we called 247 to come and check the boiler and uncap the meter.  They wanted £95 to come, despite our all singing, all dancing contract with them.  Their reason.....in case there was a problem with the gas hob which is not covered by them.  The kind man on the phone even read the small print buried in sub section, sub section, sub section etc. Just an opportunity for them to grab more money so I called a local heating engineer who came for £60.  He discovered issue number two.  On opening the boiler he found it stuffed with paper towels soaking up a tiny water leak.  The very same boiler that had been serviced by 247 in October.  So either their engineer saw and ignored the water leak and stuffed paper towels in or he didn't actually check the boiler. Either way, unacceptable.  There was no gas leak and the water leak is being fixed. Seems like the Co2 monitor was at fault. Clearly you get what you pay for in life. I will be going back to British Gas as soon as possible.Advice:  Have two Co2 monitors so you can verify if one is faulty/at the end of its expected life. Reference # WS533083"

When I do have a problem with my boiler expecting it to be covered within the insurance. I was told this would not be covered within the insurance as it was ""at risk"". But they'd be happy enough to fix it for me for an excessive amount. The insurance isn't worth the paper it is written on and they will get out of paying for it even after paying for the annual insurance cover. Avoid using 24/7 and save yourself the hassle and use another company. You'll see by the the other negative comments- I'm the only one with this issue. "

13/03/2024,01/03/2024,Beware,"We called the company and asked for an engineer to call as the pilot light had gone out and would not reignite. He came as arranged and one of his first statements was to inform me that the boiler was very old and he would quote me for a replacement. As it happens I had already instigated arrangements to replace it. He then proceeded to attempt to light the Pilot light which was successful and said he’d wait for 15 minutes to see if it stayed on. After this time I returned to the room and found that he had removed the boiler from the casing and condemned the boiler as irreparable. For the next hour and a half he brought up the sales spiel on numerous occasions. My concern is was this representative a Salesperson or an Engineer!! and why he dismantled the boiler to find a fault ie a leaking seal. Interesting considering I have a carbon monoxide monitor in the room. I now know the price of a new boiler, interest free credit and when it can be installed ie 2 days. Now left with no C/H or hot water as the new boiler is on the free Government scheme and can’t be fitted for a few weeks.Be very careful of this Organisation."

It was never ""at risk"". We had to pay ourselves. They refuse to give us the money for that, or back our monthly fee that we wasted for a year, despite providing them with evidence. I think they are running a Scam! I think they thought they could take advantage of an elderly, disabled lady.

At the beginning of the year was sent message that my boiler was due a service/ inspection (tenanted property) which I knew ,so got in touch and they couldn't do it until March! Booked it in and asked if there was a cancellation to let the tenant know as this was really to long to wait!.Service booked in for today 15th March and received text message 4.50pm yesterday saying the appointment had been cancelled due to unforseen circumstances. My tenant contacted me to say the engineer had rang her and said that he had an emergency job to do tomorrow where there were people with no power and I wd have to make another appointment. My tenant outlined that she was moving out on Saturday and new tenants were moving in the next week. I contacted 24/7 and explained that I had been waiting weeks for this service/ inspection and needed a current gas certificate before tenants could move in which is next week.The agent apologised and said the reason for the cancellation was the engineer had gone sick! I outlined that he had told my tenant he had been called away so someone wasn't telling the truth!Silence on the other end of the phone  then I was offered an appointment but again explained that this had to be either tomorrow or Saturday as the tenant was moving in next week (had van booked and had to be out of thier current property)I was told that it would be sorted out and I would receive a call in the morning.No call!Rang back again went through the whole thing again and told someone would ring   back shortly  , yes you probably can guess no call!Rang back again explained whole thing again and told that it couldn't be done and offered a later appointment which didn't work.Went to cancel policy and told 30 days cancellation so would be charged in April   asked to speak to a manager to complain as I was paying for a service that they couldn't deliver and that not only had I been lied to but still no phone call back.Told a manager would ring back  guess what still waiting.Had to get another engineer   nothing to do with this dreadful company so job is getting sorted. They are nothing sort of a bunch of scammers who don't deliver the service they have charged me for for months.Ref.WS532351"

Today they took the full years money from my bank. I contacted them and after back and forward. They said they would refund into my account 7-10 days. As far as I am concerned this was not acceptable I had other commitments leaving that account that would not be fulfilled due to them taking over £200 from my account I asked would they pay the charges due to them taking the money and they said no. Be aware to cancel your DD if you are leaving this company. Luckily my bank sorted it within minutes. Details have now been supplied.

Engineer has been sent and with the findings, I was requested to pay for the part and my boiler was deemed to be beyond economical repair. The part I was requested to purchase wasn’t even the root cause of the problem. The issue I had was intermittent. I have opted in for British Gas repair and problem was shorted without any statement that my boiler is “BER”. I don’t recommend this company to anyone who would like to have a form of protection in case of the breakdown. Go for British Gas instead, you will save yourself money, stress and time of sending your ping-pong emails.RE: there is no need to investigate, as there was sufficient time to do this.

Later phone call from company claiming my boiler was beyond economic repair either buy a new boiler or pay £920 for the repairs myself although policy stated I was covered for £1000. They could have sent the manufacturer out for £300 to check if the boiler was BER and if so I would get 200 back but lose 100. I said no and soon recieved an email to say my cover was cancelled. Since then the boiler had broken down again so I got a friend who is a gas engineer who told me there was nothing wrong with the parts they stated and it was the control panel and a pump. He advised me to get in touch with worcester as they do a one off payment of £355 so engineer came out and fixed it no problem. Needless to say it's back to British gas. Wouldn't advise anybody to use this company.

Policy can't even be cancelled as that will be another £134! Don't be fooled into thinking all is good after the first visit, after that, all they care about is taking your money. Complete Con!! Avoid at all costs!! Both of your replies to this complaint are not in any way helpful. You have not contacted me directly, despite me sending you my contact details. You are more concerned with your reputation then good customer service. Shocking. "

20/03/2024,01/03/2024,This is follow-up review of bad service…,"This is follow-up review to my review on 08/03/24 to make people aware if you are stuck in critical situation 247 does not support. We were loosing Boiler pressure was told Boiler is faulty , we replaced the boiler , the problem of pressure loss has not gone. Since 16th March I have been trying to ask 247 rescue team to send engineer and after almost few days no one has been assigned. Imagine to be without hot water and heating for 3 weeks. Even after advising emergency no one has bothered to come out. It’s better to pay a company which does not leave you out in emergency situations."

21/03/2024,01/03/2024,!!!DO NOT USE 24/7,"i believe sent a check a trader i paid out £96 for a call out to replace my heating pump in the airing cupboard 6 weeks later my ceiling in the hall collapsed through the constant drip of a failed connection, 24/7 would not get any one to stop the leak for 24 hours, i paid for a plumber who repaired it on a sunday afternoon and 24/7 reimbursed me a month later but refuse to pay for all the damage to my stair way and hall ceiling even after i offered to pay half the cost, their technical team decided it could not have been their been their fault after admitting and paying for it to be corrected by a professional firm, who said that even an apprentice would not make a mistake like that, DO NOT TOUCH THIS COMPANY!!!   i am contacting the mail and express you tube tiktok face book to warn people, they have even said sorry for the distress  and anxiety that they caused two 80+ disabled people i am contacting my solicitor to sue for that and damages STAY CLEAR OF 24/7 calling themselves we care, it means once we have you money we could not CARE LESS!!!       "
21/03/2024,01/03/2024,Avoid at all costs ,I have always been one to ensure that I have cover in place. I paid them for 3 years previously being with homeserve n AA. They only ever came to do a boiler service once a year.. at the cost of £20 to £25 most recently every year. The boiler was making a rumbling sound which the service guy ignored n did not tell me this was potentially dangerous. I lived with this sound for 1 year until recently another guy came to service boiler.. he immediately shut off boiler saying the gas valve was faulty n to contact home rescue to fix. Now comes the joke home rescue do not cover replacement of the valve.. they will change it for me at the cost of £400!! Reason being it is at risk job. Seriously why did I have cover in place I dont no.. their website shows cost to repair valve is £180 to £220.. where does a £400 cost come in.. advisor spoke to manager n cost was brought down within half hour to £304. I am disgusted with this company avoid at all cost as no repair is covered when u need it. People pay u for peace of mind.. I found a company outside who changed the valve in 1 hour for half the price quoted. I will be cancelling my policy with uRef:WS485924 here is my policy number for you to investigate... I am positive you will not do anything and will give me the same 'its in my policy terms n conditions'. However my response to this is u r a home emergency response which I have been paying 25 pounds a month for 3 years. Emergency response should mean just that! Cover is cover why should I pay extra when you offer the service.

21/03/2024,01/03/2024,scandal,"Again I write a review .  After all the stress resulting  in me having dangerously high blood pressure this company has put myself at 82 and my partner at 85Through so much stress starting  after having a brand new boiler bought and installed by them and then through their electrician making so many problems resulting in having no heating for Five days and told lies that they would come and fix and it took 5 days for it to be done. After the first 12 hours I was offered £30/35 compensation without asking for it. So after five days during the cold month of January I asked for more after a long time they decided I could have £40 compensation. I wasn’t happy.  With the way they dealt with this.  So approx 2 months later I asked to cancel the £15.39 per month I was paying for the cover , taking into account that the boiler had a guarantee of 10 years anyway.  I was told that I had unknowingly signed electronically a 10 year contract, bearing in mind I am 82 and I don’t consider that I could have possibly been explained that this contract was for 10  years.  All the people I have told of this say 10 years. Is so unacceptable and find it hard to believe.I have no paperwork at home to show me this agreement. I have had to get the prove of this signatureThrough on line and as I say at my age I don’t always find on line easy. So when I asked to cancel the agreement They say I need to pay £70.00 per year resulting in £630. In my case . So please beware any new customers of this ridiculous 10 YEAR contract. Especially if you are in your 80s."

Took some pics and left. Later had a call from 24/7 stating ‘the field engineer has reviewed the pics and confirms what the visiting engineer has said. We will not cover it’.We got our own plumber in. He laughed, changed the valve, tested the system and left. He stated on his invoice that the valve and the pipe work were completely unremarkable. The only reason I’ve given 2 not 1 stars is that 24/7 reimbursed me immediately on receipt of my plumbers invoice and report. Like all insurance companies, it seems 24/7’s first reaction is NOT to cover if they can get away with it. Don’t give up, stand your ground, and do NOT renew your policy with this company. And no doubt they will cut and paste some piecemeal apology to this post. Just disregard that sincerity.

Then straight after my service, when my boiler was in perfect working order and excellent condition especially considering its age and should keep going a good few more years ( engineers words), I get another call trying to sell me a new boiler claiming the engineer suggested it,  They eventually said it because of the age nothing else, in other words lying to me.  Then I get another call asking if everything with my service was ok and asking for feedback. I say I can’t talk as I am about to goInto a meeting.  So they say they’ll send me an email for feedback.

They never contacted me to arrange the repair I called 3 times to schedule this. They told me on 2 occasions I had no heating and hot water which was not the case and they had no knowledge of what the problem was. After telling them I wasn't a heating engineer I suggested they read the service report.

Have had 2 phone calls from them trying to get me to get a new boiler on their scheme.  Not interested.Due to get my boiler service.  24/7 called me a day before they were going to send an engineer.  Told them not enough notice.  Then they did the same again a couple of weeks later.  Said I would be available between 12 and 4, surely enough time for the engineer to fit this in.  Now I have just got a text from them saying an engineer will call between 12 and 6!!  I told the person on the phone I had to go out at 4.  SURELY THIS IS NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND ALSO FOLK NEED MORE THAN ONE DAY NOTICE.  Definitely not going to renew next year.  "

I did not receive this and consequently had to stay at home all day as the engineer did not arrive until 4 pm.

29/03/2024,01/03/2024,Ombudsman complaint being prepared,"Sadly, my experience with this company doesn’t deserve a rating. I have been trying to help an elderly relative deal with this company, without much success unfortunately. The reason for them approaching me to assist them, is that I used to be an Area Manager for a High Street bank, and fortunately my close friend is the former Director for General Insurance at the FCA, so we have a good understanding of both General Insurance regulation and Contract Law, which is relevant to this grievance. To give the reader some background to this case, my relative had a boiler on a rented property that was insured through 247 Home Rescue, the boiler being approximately 19 years old. I believe they had been insured with 24/7 Home Rescue for several years, and had called them out previously to the boiler, so the company were well aware of its age. However, on this occasion (despite the policy document being the same as previous years, and their schedule stating zero excess) they refused to go out to the boiler unless my relative paid £75 up front. Being desperate to have the boiler repaired so the Tennant wasn’t without heat and hot water, she begrudgingly paid the £75, and their engineer appeared. However, he was unable to repair the boiler, pushed for her to have a new boiler, and reported back that the boiler was blocked and required a system flush before a repair could be made etc… It was at this point I was asked to intervene. My relative rang 24/7 Home rescue and authorised them to deal with me going forward. On the 3rd October 2024 after a great deal of discussion a, manager agreed that my relative had been misled, as her policy document incorrectly stated zero excess on the policy schedule (There fault, not the customers). Despite my explaining that this invalidated the policy, and as no works had been completed, they should cancel the policy and fully refund the customer, as the policy was set up incorrectly (their words not mine), therefore under a regulated policy rules invalidating the policy as the customer was misled. However, all they offered was a £75.00 refund, or £75.00 to be deducted from the repair should she wish to proceed down that route. They advised that they would put these two offers in writing to her by email, and she would need to advise them what she wished to proceed with. Sadly, she never received an email with these offers on (Spam box also checked!!). Despite not having received any email, she contacted them again to advise them that she would like to accept the £75 reimbursement as a minimum. Unfortunately, they claimed they had no record of their conversation with myself, and refused to reimburse her anything. Knowing how much time I had spent trying to resolve this for her, she was too embarrassed to tell my that she hadn’t received the £75.00 reimbursement. It wasn’t until I met with her again yesterday, that I asked her if she had been refunded the £75.00 from this company, that she advised me that they denied all knowledge of my call, and was never refunded - Even worse, she was still paying the monthly premium for a product she was mid-sold! To add insult to injury, it would appear she had to get her own heating engineer out to repair the boiler.Upon hearing this, I rang the company yesterday. At first the representative at their call centre denied that they had any of my details in connection with this policy. It wasn’t until I mentioned a GDPR breach that I was transferred to a different person, who miraculously found the authority on file. They initially didn’t find the notes relating to my call from the 3rd October, but after approximately 40 Minutes they did, and kept apologising, as it became clear to them that a manager had previously admitted the policy schedule was wrong, and that manager had agreed to at least reimburse the £75.00 that she was wrongly charged. He then offered to reduce the next two premiums by a further £10.00 per month which I accepted on her behalf (but he now corrected the policy to include a £75.00 excess, which I presume is how this company tries to cover its tracks?) - Won’t work for a pre-existing contract I’m afraid!!This representative (while continuously apologising), said he needed to put me through to yet another department who will process the £75.00 refund. Sadly, this is where the call went further south. The representative didn’t want to simply refund the amount, but wanted proof that she’d repaired the old boiler (Not sure what this has to do with wrongly charging a customer a fee?). After 1 hour, I was cut off 🤷‍♂️  This case is now going to the ombudsman if they don’t fully refund her premiums paid to date, and her £75.00 they agreed. This will now cost them a further £750.00 in a case fee with the FOS, which is what happens when your staff don’t understand the law!"

The engineer was pleasant and efficient and managed to rewire the boiler plug so we could use the boiler on another circuit. However my gripe is that the engineer stated that 24 7 would contact us to send an electrician to fix the breaker and restore the boiler plug. After 24 hours I had no contact other than a call from 247 to say the job was fixed and complete and was I happy with the work. On me phoning the claims line again, even though we had the right cover I was informed that our problem was no longer an emergency and that I had to find an electrician myself to repair the fault !

Called to book the boiler service. The first appointment was aborted as the tenant misplaced the gas prepayment card. The second appointment on 12/03/2024 was aborted as the engineer was unable to reach the property as the road was closed by police. They rebooked the appointment for the 3rd time on 02/04/2024.When the engineer did not arrive on 02/04/2024, I contacted them and to my surprise, they cancelled the appointment as the policy had expired. They did not even bother to let me know!Rather than rebooking the appointment, customer service pushed me to speak to the retention department.I insisted on speaking to the manager, they promised me to get a call in 24 hours This never happened.This is not the first time for me to leave a poor rating for this company, but this would be the last one as I moved all my properties to other companies.Update 10.04.2024Promised a callback from a manager within 24 hours on 02/04/2024Still waiting for this call!"

And we had elderly in the house with medical condition, this urgency was completely ignored by the team who dealt with my request in a very unprofessional manner. I had to pay an excess of £75 on top of the monthly £26 I was paying them for nearly 9 months. My experience with this company has made me rethink about renewing the policy at next renewal date.

Engineer shut off gas and advised we get a boiler check done.  Called at 3pm and was told to expect a call back  'very soon'.  Called again just after 4pm and was asked to send engineers report and that, once received, soemone would call back 'almost immediately'.  Called again around 6pm to be told the report was being reviewed but an engineer would 'certainly be with us that evening'We then endured an awful and cold Scottish night with young children.  i called on the way to work around 6am to be fobbed off with the same excuses.  I was then told as it was 'an overseas call centre' they had no authority to do anything.  This operative couldnt tell me the out of hours hours but advised that my query the day before came 'out of hours'......remember I called at 3pm, 4pm and 6pm?I was 'promised' a call back at 9am.  I received a call (again on a very bad line from overseas) after 9am to be advised that it was not covered by my policy and it would be £95 plus labour!  I have read the T&CS and it clearly states 'Boiler Emergency'.  The SGN engingeer has advised we get the boiler checked in case it has a fault but a boiler policy doesn't cover that?  They said its a 'risk' but if I pay almost £100 plus a few hundred labour that risk apparently doesn't apply?I asked a more senior person to call me back and never got a response. I shall be contacting the Obudsman and urge you to PLEASE avoid this outfit if you have any sense! *They have since contacted me to discuss the situation and it';s went from bad to worse - standard 'copy and paste' emails as responses.

Requested an urgent appointment as no hot water or heating.Advised an engineer would arrive in 2 days time. I purchased the product on the basis of emergency same day appointments.After much arguing I’m told an engineer will arrive today. Received a text to confirm and say if I’m not in then I might be liable for a £30 charge. No engineer turned up, no call to advise me. Called them back to be told that the engineer is probably not coming. When I asked why the agent said it might be traffic, a job might of run late as they are busy because of winter. It is Mid April.Clearly didn’t know and not able to speak with the engineer directly. That is the domain of the scheduling team. They will call me back. No timeframe to call me back given. I tried to call back to be told they have now all gone home and back tomorrow at 9:00. Called the next day at 9:30 and they have not arrived. Not to worry though, I am on a priority list. When I ask when they will call me they cannot give a timeframe let alone tell me when I can get an engineer.I asked about escalation and complaints and told to go online.Just left wondering how long this is going to take. Sold a policy on the basis of emergency help when you need it and in this case it certainly is not. "

14/04/2024,01/04/2024,OLDER BOILER - DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ,"OLDER BOILER? BE VERY WARY OF THIS COMPANY! I have been paying premiums for 5 years to 247 Home Rescue. No claims.  In recent years I got an email to say as my boiler was now over 10 years old, the excess was going up to £75 and premiums were going up 40%.  As I am 65 years old with no family, I thought it was still worth it to be covered in case of emergency.   First claim ever, happened last month.  I had to pay the £75 excess up front, then they sent an engineer out.  He advised it was the pump and would let the office know.  The cost to supply and fit a new pump was £405. I was glad I had insurance.  247 Home Rescue called me later that day and advised my boiler was beyond economic repair and they wouldn't be fixing it.  I asked how they worked this out as it isnt explained in their policy wording.  They said 15 years ago ( the age of my boiler), my boiler would have cost £766 (I have no way to verify this, but possibly?) they don't count installation cost.  With 10% depreciation each year they said it is now worth £156. The repair cost is more than the boiler is worth so they won't pay, or even contribute to the repair.  They won't even send the engineer back to repair it if I pay the £405 in full. Beyond Economic Repair Limit £250? No they won't pay that either.  Value of my boiler £156? No not a chance, theyre not paying anything.They initially refused to pay back the excess charge and simply cancelled my policy! I'm listed as vulnerable on their data base. Goodness knows how they treat people who aren't vulnerable! So 5 years of premiums, £75 excess fee, and they simply said we're not paying anything and your policy is now cancelled.  Oh, but we can sell you a new shiny boiler for £7000 from our sister company.  Conflict of interest, or what?I worked out that even 5 years ago, by their reckoning my boiler was only worth £268.  So inflated premiums and an increased excess charge, really meant they were never going to cover pretty much anything that would require to be supplied and fitted. After 5 escalations (I may be vulnerable, but not stupid), and pointing out wording on their key facts sheet, I eventually got my excess back plus £30 for a small fan heater.  Useless at my property, and I will now have pay for another engineer to come out and do the same tests. This feels very much like a boiler insurance scam to me. So it's off to the Financial Ombudsman to see what they make of these very shady practices. "

The company is a CON. I raised a claim that my sink is blocked and shower is blocked. Their Engineer came and said I dont have the parts to fix we will have to come out again to fix. Then it took over 5 days for 24/7 to come back to me on phone and say its not in terms and conditions. Your pipe work is not correct. It was correct when it was working fine but now when it needs fixing its not correct.The Engineer on site also said your boiler drain is not connected and it leaking in the property which needs fixing. I pay preminum price to 24/7 to fix the issues but its a CON. The guy necr fixed the problem and the kitchen sink and shower is still blocked. Boiler pipe is leaking. I want to take 24/7 to court. I would need the reports from your professioanl (unprofessional) engineer who came to the property with out informing.When i raised a complainet 24/7 have the guts to call me and say we will give you compensation for £30 and our engineer has said the job is complete.Utter lie. The job is incomplete. The Engineer did not unblock the shower. he did try unblocking the sink by exerting pressure in the sink waste which eventually knocked the bioler pipe out of the ""T"" and now that is also drainging in the house. How unprofessioanl the Engineer also left his tools at my house.They are CON and know they are worng and hence trying to fob off by giving compensation. I need my full money to be returned which is in couple of hundreds and not £30.I will for sure cancel with 24/7. British Gas I have had over 15 years at my second house with out any issue or terms and conditions issue like 24/7 has. They just want easy money and not willing to fix the problem.My previous review on 5th April has more details. I would recomend all to think carefully about this company if its easy job they will fix it as its quick in and out which most people can do themselves but if it requires investigation and implmentation they will fob you off and refer you to terms on conditions.BE VERY CAREFUL. THIS IS A CON COMPANY"

Absolutely shocking and not fit for purpose. All they want to do is get you to book extra visits or try and sell you a new boiler. Call out charge both times I used them first for electrics said they could only stop so long, didn't fix problem just got electrics back on in kitchen but nothing for the rest of the house said we would need to book an appointment for them to stay longer to find the fault which would obviously cost. Got a proper electrician in who found the fault and sorted everything on 20 minute charged me £30. Second occassion upped my excess for call out as came up with some story about the boiler being over 12 years old. I built the house its only been built 10 years ago. Came out fixed it and said it was the board that was playing up but said it was only  a temporary fix but it was beyond economical repair and we needed a new boiler. Got the office to give me a call suprise they have an offer on £3000 for a new boiler. Got another gas engineer genuine bloke out didn't charge me a penny said there was nothing wrong with the boiler or the system just get a flush at the next service and call him if we have any further problems but for now it was working fine. Gave me a price.  Would charge me £350 to replace with a brand new board sourced one on the internet in seconds, but he recommended we get a reconditioned one and he would do it for  £120 parts and labour. Neither of the above to me is beyond economical repair. "

Obviously by the time they came I had to restart it. I told the engineer it was losing its ignition but because it was on he said he will report it as nothing wrong and keep an eye on it and he will keep the claim open. It’s happened again and apparently they only keep it open for 2 weeks as that is by there standards how long an intimitant problems exists and want another call out charge. Really I’m unhappy with this and past experiences with another useless engineer. Thanks for saying I’ve had a chance to speak to someone yes I did you are right another offshore manager who called me regarding the complaint. Who I told I already had a manager call me but he said it still said I wanted a call from a manager because it wasn’t closed, oh now I see companies are even getting around the trust pilot review system. Still nothing sorted to my satisfaction so not really interested in what they have said here on the review. I’ll go somewhere else in future."

19/04/2024,01/04/2024,Total scam,"We were contacted by company to arrange annual boiler service, and the was able to complete same day.Their technician was very polite and appeared competent in his work. UPATE. I initially was pleased and entered a 5 star review.However I have now lowered to 1 star.10 days after the service I noticed that the boiler was over pressurising and expelling loads of water out of the overflow. (Pressure showing at over 4 bar when heating on).I contacted the company to ask for the boiler to be checked again, as it worked fine before being serviced. However I was told I has to now submit a claim for repair as over 7 days has expired. I reluctantly did this and paid the £95 excess.When the second engineer attended he stated we required a new expansion vessel and pressure relief valve. He said he would order the parts and we would be contacted by head office.I later received a call where they stated they would NOT undertake the repair because the cost was £425 and uneconomical due to the age of the boiler, and the only option was to buy a new boiler. I asked them to advise the parts and labour costs, and it was clear they had been over-inflated the repair cost. I have now arranged for a repair by another company at a much lower cost of only £160.This company is clearly selling boiler cover under false pretences, and know they would not honor any claims if the cost exceeds £250. In view of their inflated estimates I bet they don't undertake many repair at all !!!Their conyract small print also states we cannot now cancel the policy without paying fees of £135 for the call out and £85 for the service. So I am left paying for a policy that cannot be used. TOTAL SCAM."

20/04/2024,01/04/2024,Been a customer for 3 years - poor service,"Been a customer for 3 years - service has got worse. Used to be a UK call centre with attentive staff. Now I booked in a boiler service recently and they only offered 2 dates which didn't match what I could do. I asked for alternatives and they placed me on hold for 10 minutes to find alternative dates. They could not offer any day other than a Wednesday for a service and that was over a month.I had a family member come and stay in at my house for the boiler service on the date they gave me as they could not offer any day other than a Wednesday! After they had stayed in all day without an accurate time given for the boiler service they eventually cancelled the appointment at 15:22.  When I tried to rearrange, I was placed on hold for 10 minutes by the call centre worker who was trying to find another date! I hung up as this is unacceptable and this kind of data should be at the operator's fingertips. When I emailed to rearrange a new service, I was offered an alternative date in 6 weeks. Would absolutely not recommend this company.========UPDATE - 1 week later =======Company tried to call me to discuss.  I called back and the person who answered had no record of me calling the company since over a year ago! In spite of the fact the company had been calling me most days since I wrote this TrusPilot review.After explaining what had happened the operator then requested to put me on hold.  After saying I wouldn't be put on hold as every time they did that I was on hold for 10 minutes he agreed very kindly to investigate and call me back.  1 days has passed since and I have received no call back.In my experience, the company has not kept up-to-date records of my account or my personal data. I requested to cancel my contract with them a week ago and still have not had a reply to that email. Just a deluge of phonecalls during the working day when I am unable to answer.   ======= Update 1.5 weeks later =====Company emailed to ask for a convenient time to call. I said after 4pm and gave the number they already have on the system. The company attempted to call me twice before 4pm then sent an email asking me to call them as they were unable to contact me. Have you even read my emails. I would advise people to avoid this company at all costs. They still have not cancelled my contract despite me putting this in writing twice."

Call centre overseas and the team there can only log a claim so you have to wait 24hrs for another team to call you back, and then book in an appointment. It’s then a wait for a few days for a visit. In my case the engineer failed to show up at time given but 247 had no idea. I then chased and a new engineer came hours later and said he’d fixed it but the same error code flashed up few hours after. Im now back into the cycle of calling and waiting. 247 must mean 24hrs waiting for a call back and 7 days waiting for a visit. £18pcm + £95 call out for that service! Engineers also subcontractors so its roulette as to if they are any good or care at all about fixing the issue. Crap. Avoid. "

As such, I have looked at yourselves and some competitors (such as YourRepair, Hometree and more). I have a scheduled call tomorrow with one of your colleagues to discuss whether to go-ahead and use 24/7. I wanted to find out a little more about your company, service and reputation. As many prospective customers would. I looked on Trustpilot and Google reviews then Facebook.So I had reviewed some '24/7' Facebook posts. In doing so I found a number of posts that had comments on that I could not see. I asked in a couple of these posts why the comments might be hidden (at that point I was assuming they must be negative). I have had another look today and you have either completely removed your presence from Facebook OR you have blocked me. This explains a lot.Needless to say, I won't be using you now.I'd like to think that you have a) an employee who is not representing your values OR b) is doing this with your full company approval. Either way, this is pretty poor.It's not the good reviews that win peoples trust - it's the bad ones (and everyone has bad ones), the ones that show the reader how you treat people when things go wrong.Some of us ALWAYS start with the 1* reviews and work upwards."

25/04/2024,01/04/2024,Absolutely appalling experience with…,"Absolutely appalling experience with 247 Home Care. Currently, I have a complaint being handled by the Ombudsman service due to their incompetence.A couple of years ago, I had an engineer service my boiler. Despite mentioning that the boiler pressure dropped every few days, the engineer didn't bother checking any of the radiators and simply dismissed it. As expected, the issue persisted and worsened over time, eventually dropping daily. After paying a £95 excess fee, another engineer replaced the expansion valve, claiming it was the problem. Yet, the very next day, the issue recurred. Shockingly, no radiators were inspected for leaks during either visit.Upon contacting them again, I was informed that they couldn't check anything else as per their terms and conditions, leaving me stranded. Days later, my living room radiator pipe burst, causing a major water leak that flooded one side of the room. This resulted in additional expenses of £160 to an independent plumber to secure and replace the damaged valve, not to mention the water damage to my laminating flooring, which is now uneven.Following my complaint to 247, they callously requested all invoices and pictures of damage, only to then wash their hands of any responsibility, claiming it wasn't their fault.To add insult to injury, amidst this chaos, they went ahead and renewed my policy despite my cancelling my auto renewal, then blamed it on me saying their system showed I renewed it. In summary, opting for 247 Home Care is nothing short of a waste of money. Spare yourself the headache, hassle, and stress by choosing a more reliable company. A few extra pounds spent elsewhere could save you from endless frustration."

","Before going into the specifics, I want to say that Richard (the senior engineer who managed to fix the issue with my boiler) was brilliant. Very good, thorough, and managed to sort everything in no time, and if I could rate him personally, I would rate him 5/5Having said that, I am rating 24/7 Home Rescue a 1/5 because I cannot choose 0 stars. The whole management process of my claim was appalling. I opened a claim for leaky (1 yo) boiler with loss of pressure on 8th March. The whole situation was resolved (thanks to Richard, again) on 25th April! 7 weeks in total!In those 7 weeks I had:* 4 different engineers attending my property * Each one had a different diagnosis requiring new spare parts to replace* The lowest point was when I had to live without hot water and heating for a whole week (and partly without electricity/internet for 2 days) because one of the engineers who attempted to fix the boiler ended up completely messing things up AND rip some wires off the walls, hence the no electricity* After being very vocal on the phone, Richard was sent to my property on a Saturday and immediately identified the issue. He also fixed the broken electrics straight away and made sure he ordered the (actual!) spare parts needed to fix my boiler once and for all and came as soon as the parts were available. Not a single time was I taken seriously (would anyone live without hot water and heating, especially when it is effectively cold outside?). In short, I would definitely avoid 24/7 Home Rescue as a company but would 100% recommend Richard as a senior engineer. EDIT: Now that the review is live on TrustPilot, I can also say that I was lied to on the phone earlier. I was told that the review (i.e. the rating) would be exclusively about the engineer who fixed my issue, not 24/7 Home Rescue. I argued on the phone that it didn't seem like it would be the case, if the review were to be published. I was assured multiple times that the review would only be about Richard, who was brilliant (as said above). I am quite glad I didn't trust the person on the phone and maintain my 1 (well, 0) star rating for 24/7 Home Rescue. Now on top of a poor customer experience I can add lies to the long list of unprofessional behaviour. EDIT2: As per the response below, it seems that this has been passed onto the complaints team. Very ""funny"" as when I was asked about raising a complaint, I was told I would be called back. I, of course, never was. "

28/04/2024,01/04/2024,This is my second negative experience…,"This is my second negative experience with this company. I reported a leaking tap on their online page. A couple of days later I received an email saying they’d tried to phone me and had no answer so if I still required assistance to phone them. They hadn’t tried to phone me as I had no missed calls on my phone, so that wasn’t true.I phoned them only to be told my leaking tap wasn’t covered. I was a bit baffled as it’s on their drop down menu and isn’t mentioned in the one page of what’s covered and what’s not covered. The operator then without hesitation said it’s in page 7 of the T&Cs. Obviously a page all their operators are familiar with so they have no need to scour the lengthy documentation to find the clause.I’ve now looked at all the documentation I received and there is no mention anywhere that they will not repair a leaking tap. So I would like the company to tell me where that clause is buried?My homecare agreement has a big green tick for all plumbing.Last time they refused to fix a lock on my back door as my conservatory door was considered my back door. I could only see a mention of a porch. I left the operator a 1 out of 5 although it’s not his fault. I later received an email asking why I was unhappy?? Really. No reply yet but I’m not expecting one. Ridiculous that companies say they cover plumbing etc.They’ve even removed my claim from my account so it’s no longer there. I’ll leave my service contract number so the company can show me the clause on page 6 as I can’t find it in anything I have.Well, after telling me they’d look into their policies to make sure my experience with them doesn’t happen again, I have heard nothing whatsoever. No explanation of where this get out of jail clause they quoted is. That’s because I’ve scoured the documents and it’s not there. So they don’t have it.I final bit. I did get my service and on my boiler last time with these guys. I asked the engineer to fill the readings in on my Valliant service book. He didn’t know them as he hadn’t done them, so he made them up!Also, I have a filter attached to the return pipe to the boiler. He hadn’t cleaned that as I had a bit of paint in the seal which wasn’t broken. He’d never touched it.Can I have a reply about all that ? "

30/04/2024,01/04/2024,Six weeks and boiler still not working…,"Six weeks and boiler still not working properly after numerous visits from engineer(s). Only intermittent hot water and heating until the boiler issues an error code and shuts down. If an engineer orders parts, there is typically a two day wait for the parts to be authorised and arrive and then two or three days before an engineer is booked in, meaning any repair that needs ordered parts is going to take about 5 days even if they manage to guess what the problem is first time. If it needs a second visit that’s another 5 days and so on. Call centre staff are not able to answer any technical questions or complaints, so you have to wait another day for a call back, so the whole process drags on and on. I will update my review if they manage to get the boiler working again. Update: Now trying to cancel the policy and get someone else to look at the boiler but of course 247 are saying I cant end the policy before the 12 months is up and they will charge me if I leave early. Adding insult to injury is the only way I can describe this. I would recommend anyone avoid this company at all costs. Update: After 9 phone calls 247 have agreed to cancel the policy and take no further payments. I still have water leaking from the boiler on to the kitchen worksurface but at least I’m not paying for the privilege.   "

Engineer was called in and he managed to break the boiler completely on his first visit and said more parts are required. During the second visit he changed some parts and realized something else is required and left the home with no heating and hot water after troubleshooting and looking for videos on youtube on how to fix.. 1 week later waiting for an update and upon calling 24/7 they said that they are waiting on the cost for gas valve. Absolutely horrible service as the person that I spoke to had no empathy to the fact that they had left the house with no heating or hot-water for an entire week for a person with health condition at the property. Everything they promise at the time of signing up is nothing but a lie as when it comes to delivering the service they care the least.After calling to get an update, I am told that the cost of repair is £500 so they won't repair it and want me to pay approx 2700 to get a new boiler installed through them. I can understand the reason for repair if parts are not available but denying to repair the boiler because it will cost them £500 and expecting me to pay for new boiler is a joke. Everything they promise at the time of selling insurance seems a lie and when it comes to delivering the service they find excuses to not deliver. This company is a joke"

He had to use my hairdryer on it solidly for 30 minutes or so, using up my electricity money...then laid it on thick saying I needed a new boiler as mine was so old and I'm obviously ill and vulnerable so need a working boiler.Within a few hours of the service, boiler stopped working and took 4 days for an engineer to come out. Phone customer service was terrible and unhelpful. In the meantime I had 2 calls trying to sell me a new boiler. When the engineer came to fix it second time he was helpful and friendly, said I didn't need a new boiler, and the problem was a simple thing the first engineer had forgot to do as he left.Very regretful I'd already signed up to another year of their boiler cover as I would have definitely not continued had I known their service, inefficiency, slowness and priority to upsell."

07/05/2024,01/05/2024,Do not use if a Landlord/Landlady,"Dreadful customer service. I have had HUGE problems both times I have tried to use them despite having a Landlord complete house policy including boiler, plumbing and electrics. The first time I had HUGE problems trying to book my boiler service in time for compliance with legislation. Initially they told me that I was calling too early so to try again nearer the time. When I tried nearer the time they tried to give me an appointment which was too late to be compliant. Recently I had problems with booking an emergency plumber. They could not immediately get through to the managing agents so tried to leave a message on an unrelated mobile. They eventually managed to get through to my tenant but then failed to book an appointment and left a potentially problematic water leak for a whole bank holiday weekend. I was eventually informed via my Managing Agent that the supplier had failed to go ahead as they needed to speak to the policy holder- however the supplier had not at any time tried to contact the policy holder and I ended up having to call them. This was due to the excess on my policy which needed to be paid first/upfront. If the policy holder had not been contactable (e.g. abroad etc) then the plumbing fix would not have proceeded as the supplier refuses to invoice for this excess fee and wants immediate payment before any job takes place. This is even despite the problems I explained to their customer service team regarding booking any appointment.Further Update (8/5/24) Despite having reported all the problems that I am having messages that should go to tenant regarding timing of plumbers visit still being sent to landlord's mobile when this is not appropriate/required as these should be sent to the tenant instead. Also as the landlady after the plumber's visit I phoned up 24/7 to obtain a report as to how the plumbers visit had gone and whether the issue was now fixed. Unfortunately 24/7 customer service were unable to advise me. It was important for me to know quite quickly as I am having a new washing machine delivered. I did explain this to the representative but they did not seem at all interested in my dilemma."

The engineer didn't Service the boiler, only checked the gas emissions.  He was here for 20 minutes at the most.  The boiler broke down and they told me they wanted ove £360 to repair as the gas control valve needed replacing.  This was even though it was under contract and they had been taking money off me every month (boiler was 11 years old) I refused and got a reputable company in who cheked it over and it wasn't the gas control valve. It was broken because they hadn't Serviced it properly. Servicing should take at lease an hour. Because of this I've had to get the boiler replaced.I van only say AVOID AVOID AVOID THEM."
10/05/2024,01/05/2024,Another update from the company that…,"Another update from the company that rescues you from nothing… apparently their engineers can fix your central heating system without going anywhere near the plumbing. When they claimed to have fixed it through some form of telepathic plumbing and your water pressure crashes, then that’s not linked and they want an additional £90 call out fee, then when the original fault recurs 4 weeks later, that’s another £90 call out. When you complain and refuse to pay the £40 cancellation fee, you get Stanley. Stanley is head of complaints for the company so he must be extremely busy. He did take time out of his hectic schedule to answer my complaint and offered to reduce the fee from £40 to £30, Stanley said this was his final offer, Stanley is currently singing for his £30. 😂"

Now the customer services are telling me they can't do this. They kept me on the phone for over 20 minutes, refused to pass me onto a supervisor, I asked to make a complaint, they hung up on me. When the department that makes appointments called, they gave me the password, so I don't understand why I was being told they couldn't. Really stressful experience.

If you buy a plan the first 30 days you are unable to claim, this I would expect to be normal practice, if your appliances have a breakdown after that 30 day waiting period and the engineer orders your parts and then the parts are on back order with no idea when they will come in , this company will not do anything until you have paid your plan for over 6 months ( never told this when brought) Why 6 months, nearly every other warranty company only have and I believe should have a 30 day waiting period for anything wrong with that appliance, up to a certain limit if a replacement is needed. Not value for money at all, I have realised better plans out there for the same cost . "

16/05/2024,01/05/2024,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"During 2023 an engineer attended at my property to service the boiler.  This engineer broke a clip holding the inside boiler cover to the boiler itself.  The engineer confirmed to me that he had broken the clip at the time (0.27p each).  24/7 then tried to charge me for this breakage at £109.00 for the engineer to attend back at the property to fix it.  When I queried this 24/7 contacted the engineer who initially admitted to me that he had broken the clip and he also admitted to 24/7 that he had broken the clip.  The clip was replaced free of charge and in this engineer's report it was confirmed that both clips were intact - 24/7 confirmed this to me during my complaint.  Then in 2024 a different engineer attended at the property, admitted he too had broken a clip, the black plastic remnants were on the floor and he told me he had ordered a new clip.  After he left my property, the control panel of the boiler dropped down as this engineer had not screwed it in properly (he told me he could not find his blue screwdriver).  I heard nothing from 24/7 so phoned up and explained what had happened and made a complaint when I was told again, I would have to pay £109.00 to replace the clip (which costs 0.27p) which held the internal boiler cover in place which 24/7 said had caused the control panel to slip and as the clip was not covered in the policy, as the engineer had confirmed that he had not broken it but confirmed to them that it was missing when he arrived at my property on his report, I would need to pay £109.00.  I confirmed that the engineer had indeed broken the clip as I had swept up the evidence.  The complaint was looked into but as the 24/7 engineer had reported that the clip had been missing, which was untrue, the complaint was not upheld so I asked for a manager call back.  This was received and I explained that if the clip had been missing previously, then the boiler cover would have shown signs of this as the cover would not have been on.  The complaint manager refused to accept this or accept that the engineer's report from 2023 confirmed both clips were on the boiler.  I confirmed that no-one had been in the boiler since the last engineer serviced it during 2023 and if the clip had dropped down from the boiler then it would still be within the boxed-in boiler compartment, and it was not.  The complaint was not upheld again and the complaints manager, who totally refused to give me his manager's name etc, told me I would have to pay for a further engineer visit of £109.00. I explained that if the clip was not on the boiler from 2023 then the engineer who attended the property at that time would not have been able to attach the internal boiler cover at that time.  When the boiler was serviced in 2023 there were no signs on the boiler that a clip was missing and no signs that the clip was missing when the engineer attended during 2024.  WOMEN WHO ARE ON THEIR OWN - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY - the engineer during 2024 said 'I hope I am going to get a thank you when I have finished' - creepy or what!   DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AS IT WILL COST YOU IN THE LONG RUN AND IT COSTS YOU TO GET OUT OF THE CONTRACT.  BE VERY WISE AND GIVE THIS COMPANY A TOTAL MISS. TOTALLY UNSCRUPULOUS COMPANY AND UNSAFE FOR WOMEN TO USE. 247 replied to this complaint very weakly, stating the 2024 engineer's report said the 'clip was missing"", however, the engineer's report from 2023 confirmed that '2 clips were present at that time on the internal boiler cover. So which engineer lied?  No one but the engineer ever goes in the boiler built in cupboard.  Martin Lewis' website has a dossier on 247 and the reviews are dire.  As I said previously, DO NOT USE 247, you will end up paying the price.  Martin Lewis' website is full of complaints about 247 with many dissatisfied customers.  "

From the moment Steven arrived, his politeness and professionalism were evident. He greeted me warmly and took the time to explain the service process, which immediately put me at ease.Steven's extensive knowledge was apparent as he meticulously inspected and serviced the boiler. His diligence ensured that every aspect of the service was thoroughly completed, and he was more than happy to answer any questions I had, providing detailed explanations and useful tips for maintaining the boiler's efficiency.What truly stood out was Steven's efficiency. He worked swiftly yet meticulously, ensuring that the job was done to the highest standard without cutting any corners. The service was completed in a timely manner, leaving me confident in the reliability of my boiler for the upcoming year.Overall, Steven's exceptional politeness, deep expertise, and diligent efficiency made this boiler service experience with 24|7 Home Rescue truly outstanding.

17/05/2024,01/05/2024,Age discrimination?,"24/7 have been accepting a premium from me to repair and service my boiler for years in the full knowledge that it is over 20 years old. The first time I actually need a repair I'm told that they won't do it because it's ' beyond economical repair ' The  cost of the repair is just over £300( inc vat ) and apparently my boiler is only worth £250. If I had been told that they wouldn't carry out a repair above this amount this before I took out the policy I wouldn't have wasted my money. It seems that although I pay the same premium as for a new boiler, for which they would have carried out the repair, they won't repair mine because of it's age '. I can't really see the relevance of this ' beyond economical repair ' defence - we aren't talking about a written off car( to use thier analogy ) just a boiler which is getting older. I can't seem to get this point across to them as they just  keep spouting ' beyond economical repair' like some invisible shield "

Had to keep chasing them to carry out an annual service which we were supposedly paying for. To cut a long story short we called them out in May 2024 because hot water kept going and coming back. We were told boiler irrepairable , or under their policy they were claiming would cost more than £250 to repair so not worth it. I also had to pay a fee for call out as boiler was over 10 yrs old. Something like £75. Very very quick to get out a very overpriced quote for a new boiler. Cancelled our cover and went elsewhere calling in an independent gas fitter. Came today carried out a full service drained off so much gunk commented that boiler hadn't been serviced properly for many years. Got it working now its been cleaned properly should last about another 10 yrs..... i mean what the heck. What were we paying for if services havent been done properly for years... Avoid for boiler care anyone reading this. Save yourself the money and stress."

Finally when they arrived they broke the boiler and then needed parts (another booking). We spent a long time without  heating & hot water.Six months later the Fridge Freezer broke down and a similar thing happened.

Contacted the company but a bunch of looters sit there and say they cant do anything. Never touch this company again. I regret choosing them. Homeserve and British gas are much better

Following one visit at Christmas we were left with a gas leak. Company says it couldn't have been caused by them but when emergency gas service say the fitting hadn't been tightened, it's a bit puzzling. Personally I'd avoid.   Message below said they'd look into it...two months later no reply."

30/05/2024,01/05/2024,Unacceptable Delay and Lack of Prompt Service from 247,"I am deeply disappointed with the service provided by 247. Yesterday evening (29/5), I discovered that my boiler was not functioning, leaving my entire home without hot water. I immediately called the 24/7 helpline at 10 PM, and the customer service representative assured me that they would notify me as soon as an engineer was assigned to address the issue today (30/5).However, by 11:30 AM today, I had still not received any update. I called the helpline again, and the customer service representative kindly followed up on the status of the repair. Regrettably, I was informed that the earliest available timeslot to fix my boiler was on Monday (3/6) - a full 5 days after the initial breakdown.I am shocked and dismayed by this unacceptable delay. I should not have to wait nearly a week to have my boiler repaired, especially given that my whole family left without hot water for the entire duration. This is a wholly unsatisfactory level of service, and I had expected a much more prompt and efficient response from 247.I sincerely hope that the company will review its procedures and resource allocation to ensure that customers experiencing urgent issues can have their problems resolved in a timely manner. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied, and I would strongly caution others against relying on this company's services based on my disappointing encounter."

When taking the policy out the agent reassure you that the engineer carry the parts with them in their van but this is not true they don't have parts they always have to order and by the time they get to you it takes 4 days+. Vulnerable people like myself have no other choice but to suffer like this. I have been neglected don't know how long I will have to cope with this.

14/06/2024,01/06/2024,What a nightmare! Please be wary of the positives…,"Please be wary of the positives reviews. This is LONG! Unfortunately I fall under the “should be no star” reviews. I called today - 14.06.24 at 11:03. This was after trying to use the App which is rubbish, but now rather telling of this company as they are the same.  I tried to use the chat - luckily I got the number I needed from them of whom to contact. So… I put my heating on last night and on switching it off -E1 code came up. I topped up the pressure. Now the boiler is 11 years old but is still functioning. Today when I woke up at 6 am, I noticed the boiler pressure had dropped again to E1 and has since done x3 times in the space of 3 hours (after being topped up each time). My partner noticed the carpet in the hall was soaked and we noticed a leak from the radiator. We have made an attempt to turn off but there is water is dripping out and it is next to an electrical point. We have pulled back the carpet and underlay and the floor was soaked. We dried it off and have a dehumidifier set up.  This is relevant because once I managed to get through to someone at 24/7 I explained all this to them. They advised they could arrange a call out and that it would be a £95 call out fee. I accepted, paid and then got told that someone would be out tomorrow on 15.06.24 between 10-18:00 with a 30min call beforehand. I advised this was not suitable and what I was told,  as I would class this an an emergency - it’s an uncontainable leak!!! Plus the employee on the phone never indicated that it would be the next day on the call. The phone went silent and then there was a dead tone. I called back and got advised that 24/7 had no engineers available. Sorry - they do have engineers in the area but they are full. The also advised their policy is 24hours! So I explained they have until 11:03 on the 15.06.24 then! They couldn’t care less. I wouldn’t trust them to empty a bath let alone run one. I advised I would have to call a plumber as this is an emergency. They just kept sticking to to the “24 hour policy” jargon. I told them this pointless conversation was cutting into my time to get a plumber so they should cancel the call out and refund the payment. I was told this refund would be between 5-7 days. I ended the call and I found an emergency plumber which is now going to cost me over £200 for a call out but they will be here before 4pm today. During that call I noticed I had three voicemails from 247 - all very difficult to understand due to the background noice, but I did make out they wanted me to call back and confirm if I wanted the call to be cancelled and refunded. I called back and the person I spoke with said it had been cancelled and the refund would be 7-10 days! 3 people at 24/7 and it wasn’t sorted.  At this point - I wouldn’t trust them with being able to tell the difference between a bath and a shower! I pay £14.95 a month for this and now I am out of pocket and I have had zero service provided for.  24/7 rescue????? More like “how do you spell rescue”! Shocking company. And I better get refunded! I can’t want to not have to be with this company anymore. I may add that my per month amount went from £6.95 per month to £14.95 the next year and I didn’t get a service in my first year as they have no availability so the they didn’t provide the boiler check in the first year. And a little nod to 24/7 - no, before you ask… i won’t provide my policy number here as it goes against GDPR as I’m pretty sure you “won’t be able to find my details”…. Your gold standard response.

He did no work, claiming that the issue was not classified as an emergency, despite the fact that my apartment had no electricity. I complained to 24/7 Home Rescue, but they have not contacted me and have refused to refund my money. I had to pay £150 to another electrician who ultimately resolved the issue. Overall, it was an appalling job done by 24/7 Home Rescue. I would strongly advise against using their services."

So I had to call up and sit on hold and wait for someone answer. The gentlemen on the other end of the phone proceeded to give me the hard sell about transfering my policy. When I told him I wasn't interested he then tried to get me to give him the contact details of the people moving in after we leave! After I rejected that as well he put me on hold to check ""my cancellation process"". Then after a long wait he then tried to say I needed to pay another month's cover for  ""30 days notice"" for a house I won't be living in. Super scummy process to cancel a boiler cover that was not very good to begin with. If you are considering getting cover from 247 Home Rescue I would STRONGLY advise against it. Terrible company. "

Failed the emission test and stated the burner had gone and it needed a new burner my Ideal boiler which is just 10 years old. Was quoted to pay an extra £325 to fix a problem to which you think it would be covered by the breakdown cover I pay for monthly. Shocking customer service I was told to either pay or find someone else to fix the problem. I will not be renewing. Spread the word, these people are scamming customers and refusing to pay out on a broken boiler. I was told I couldn't use the boiler yet they wouldn't fix it."
18/06/2024,01/06/2024,Peace of mind or lottery with a middleman?,"I was hesitant to post this review initially, but eventually posted as you might find some thoughts in here useful. I’m letting a few properties and have had an emergency cover contract with 247 for around 5 years, covering all let and my own property. During these5 years there have been 3 emergency cases altogether and 247 didn’t provide any emergency support with either: Saniflo systems aren’t covered (even in case of emergency), leaks must be visible and accessible (now I know track and trace excluded, but why don’t you state this in bold when advertising your peace of mind?), toilet blockages aren’t emergencies as long as there is another toilet in the building (regardless of the number of inhabitants), etc. The small print takes care of minimizing 247’s headache. Ultimately, now having gone through all of this – buying the emergency cover won’t provide you with so heavily promoted “peace of mind” whatsoever, instead, you acquire a lottery ticket with limited chances of getting help, ending up with even more hassle. Last case: electrics tripping across the ground floor, no domestic hot water, no shower, no fridge, food went off, plus the risk of fire (which was subsequently confirmed upon examination of one of the sockets). 247 couldn’t bring an electrician the day of logging the request, advised the tenant to expect an electrician next day 9am-7pm. Despite minors staying in the house. By 2 pm next day still no electrician and no updates. Long story short, given the risk of fire, the tenant arranged an electrician through myBuilder platform who turned up 30 mins after the call and did the job within 2 hours.Conclusion: 247 are just a middleman happily taking your money. No peace of mind, good looking on paper but in reality - very limited support with extremely poor turnaround time. I will not prolong my contracts with 247, or any other emergency company, instead, all the money saved will go into a savings bank account forming an “emergency fund”. If anything - myBuilder guys are always there and don’t hide behind the small print. This is the real peace of mind.PS: just read a nearly identical Trustpilot post, where a customer complained of 247's electrician not considering their electrics tripping as emergency. In their polite response 247 reassured this wouldn't happen again, what an irony 247. Very sad..."

I spent ages getting through to the correct department again, for them to send out engineer to test and turn boiler on. I was asked 3 times to send the Transco report which I had sent on the first request, so that had been sitting somewhere with no progress while I (a priority customer was without heating and hot water for 3 days). They kept telling me it was a service (I had the service on the 4/6) I kept saying it was a test, check and turn on!

I DO NOT WANT TO REACTIVATE MY ACCOUNT AND I DO NOT WANT TO RECEIVE ANY MORE EMAILS FROM THEM. Should I receive any further communication from this company I will immediately take the matter with the financial ombudsman. ARE YOU LISTENING 24|7. These people are a disgrace and I would urge anyone seeking boiler cover to seriously consider NOT USING 24|7. 7 Mar 2024DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE THIS COMPANYI am a cancelled boiler breakdown customer with 247 Home Rescue and recently ended the policy. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE THIS COMPANY. After cancellation, they have regularly sent reactivation texts and emails which at first I ignored but then forwarded one such email to a scam email agency. After which 247 somehow managed to reactivate my account and set up a direct debit with my bank without authorisation. I have contacted 247 and they assured me the contacts will stop. It has not stopped. If it continues I will take the matter further starting with the Financial Ombudsman.Date of experience: 04 March 2024"

We had provided details of our oil fuelled boiler at the outset, so were shocked to learn that this company will only service and repair gas boilers.  This is not made clear in any of their documentation, or at the time of purchase.  When we complained we were advised to check the small print on page seven, bullet point 3  where it states 'We aren’t able to cover any non-natural gas boiler'.The company sold us this policy despite being fully informed of our boiler type.The lack of clarity is misleading.  The consumer Rights Act 2015 states that 'key terms must be prominent and transparent'.We feel that this policy was mid sold as it was not suitable for our needs."

The boiler is not accessed by us and I am unsure of how we could have broken something. Disputing the issue, 247’s T&Cs and requested the contract be cancelled.

03/07/2024,01/07/2024,24-Jul,"24/7. Terrible. High excess fees, which would be the usual callout and charge for anyone else to do the required job. Their small print often excludes covering the job that you expect to be completed, but they will try their best to complete the job. Just disappointing customer service. Not good value for money and will try to force excessive price increases year-on-year with worse customer service each year. Renewal cost for year was £336!!! Wowser! And then you have to pay an excess on any call-outs of £75, really excessive excess! However, at the smallest sniff of leaving them, they’ll try and keep you by offering a price which is “apparently” competitive; it truly isn’t! Would NOT recommend. Additionally, when I cancelled my final DD, they attempted to cancel my contract, even though it still had over 2 weeks to run, which was in breach of the contract which had been setup. Not trustworthy. Definitely wouldn’t recommend. "

I leaked into the shower wall and I have been asked by the Customer advisor to break the tiles so that their engineer can see the leak visible. I'm not sure why you would ask customers to break things for their competent (or not) engineers to observe. They will insist on collecting excess before even confirming whether they can fix the job.

06/07/2024,01/07/2024,Brilliant Customer Care from 24/7 Home Rescue & Competitive Price Offer. ,"I spent weeks looking for boiler home care provider that would be conducive to my Mother & myself, as we both have disabilities. I was with SES but, their services were taken over by Home Serve. I had a few issues with Home Serve customer services which I felt couldn’t be resolved & mainly, because the renewal contract price, which was extremely unaffordable for my Mother. I did take out a contract with a company called Your Repair but, I cancelled within a few days. They were not able to provide a service that would accommodate the disability needs for my Mother & myself. I then came across 24/7 Home Rescue & I had seen some excellent recommendations from Moneycheck & Heatingforce.I had also read about 24/7 Home Rescue & various reviews on Trust Pilot. I felt quite confident that I had found the right boiler home care provider. Whilst I was applying online to signup to 24/7 Home Rescue, I got a phone call from one of their customer service representatives, whose name is Ajmal. He had seen my online application & that I had used a promotional discount code. He said he could offer me a better offer.Ajmal was very polite & friendly & listened attentively to the problems that I had experienced with other providers. He was very empathetic towards the disability needs of my Mother & myself but, more concerned about by my Mother’s chronic multiple health issues. She is currently 87 years old & I am also her carer.Ajmal was so courteous & professional at his job & explained everything to me very clearly. He was so kind & patient & I felt that he understood my circumstances & what I was looking for. He provided me with an excellent monthly payment, saving me over £30 compared to my previous providers. After I had setup a new boiler contract with 24/7 Home Rescue, I received another phonecall from call from Ajmal, confirming that he had received all the necessary documents that he needed & confirming that a hard copy of my boiler care contract, would be sent by post, which I have received.I like to thank other customer care representatives who had also called me a few days ago, just to make sure that my Mother & I were happy with everything & I said that we were extremely happy. I can truly recommend 24/7 Home Rescue as a boiler care service provider & for the outstanding customer care that they had provided me.   Thank you "

08/07/2024,01/07/2024,Avoid this company at all costs! hidden charges,"I had protection through one of there policies. When I made a claim they always came out with charges in the fine print that were more than the actual repairs. I got a service done on my boiler at the very start and they then tried to charge me for repairs. When I showed this to the gas engineer as it was the same person who came back out to do a ""repair"" he couldn't understand the charges they were trying to bill me. They also threatened to cancel my policy if I didn't get them done. When I made a claim for a repair they then told me I would need to wait a week at least. I live in a city so found this unacceptable. Wasn't like I lived rural. They were constantly trying to charge me for repairs under my policy and didn't want to acknowledge some repairs. Their customer service is also a shambles. To avoid doing repairs they tried to offer me pennies to refund my policy to avoid doing repairs. I have calls which I made to the company on record of them trying to charge me hundreds of £ before a repair can be carried out. As insult, because I didn't auto renew I have been bombarded with emails and calls trying to get me to renew. Clearly just forgetting how they have treated a customer. PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! Happy to send on calls as a example of what people can expect from this company & emails that show what they tried to charge me during there annual service to help customers avoid paying ludicrous fees."

Second day I receive email from 24/7 that my boiler is write off and they cancel my insurance because the costs are too high. I didn't ask for any claim,or intending to do one.

We got insurance for our boiler just to make sure we were covered incase it stopped working or we had any issues. Our boiler started playing up and the hot water wasn't working so we reached out to them.When you contact them they tell you it can take 48 hours to find an engineer to visit the property so all you can do is wait. An engineer visited the property the next day and found the problem in 10 minutes but could not fix it (even though it was a small and easy job) because he needed to go back to the company to get permission for the work. Another 24 hours have passed and we still haven't had the work approved and its still being reviewed. It's now been 3 days without hot water and we are simply told to wait even though this is classed as an emergency not having hot water. We pay £20 a month for this cover but its a complete waste of money! Do not even consider using this company because they are completely USELESS. We will be cancelling our contract ASAP and finding another provider even if we have to pay more.  After complaining about this terrible experience I get a reply saying they don't have my details in the system when both my partner and I are on the policy. This proves exactly why you should stay away from this company! Complete rubbish.

They instructed 24/7 to refund my excess and pay me an additional goodwill payment for all the inconvenience. On Thursday July 4 24/7 emailed me asking for my bank details. I replied the same day and the £ was in my account first thing Monday morning. 24/7 never did anything so quickly before.What pleases me as much as the settlement is the fact that 24/7’s handling of my complaint and the appalling way they handled it is all on the FOS records as well as Trust Pilot’s.The only reason I have rated 24/7 as 1 star  is solely because there is no star that is lower. I would have rated 24/7 as ZERO if that had been possible. Their customer service and care it non-existent.On Nov. 27 last year our 6 year old boiler broke down and it took until Dec. 27 before the problems were fixed. We were without hot water and central heating for 4.5 weeks and Christmas and Boxing Day were cancelled.In those 4.5 weeks we received 4 visits from 24/7’s appointed boiler engineering company and 3 from the boiler manufacturer. The latter  had to come 3 times due to the incompetence of the former and their last 2 visits I had to organise myself as 24/7 did nothing about it.1 	I hate to think how much time I wasted on phone calls and emails to 24/7 in those 4.5 weeks with endless hours waiting to speak to someone.2	It was impossible to speak to the same member of 24/7’s staff each time I phoned and that meant going through all the details every time I rang.3 	7 visits by engineers to fix a boiler only 6 years old is ludicrous and it was only due to the boiler manufacturer's engineers that the boiler was finally fixed on Dec. 27.4 	On Jan. 2 I sent a comprehensive diary on a day by day basis of everything that had happened in those 4.5 weeks to the FOS and the FOS never had to ask me for any more information.5	Prior to 4 above 24/7 had offered to reimburse my excess. I countered that saying that I would accept that if they paid for the new pump as a gesture of goodwill. They refused - hence my approach to the FOS.6 	24/7’s Ts and Cs indicate that they will offer customers in our situation portable heaters. The offer was never ever  forthcoming.The paragraph below is taken from reviews on TP  and is another 1 star only. It very aptly sums up their utter incompetence and ""could not care less attitude"". This is a “bog standard “ 24/7 reply to more than one 1 star only dissatisfied customer. 24/7 could not have summed up its busines acumen more accuraletly if it had tried. Talk about “shooting yourself in the foot”. What a bullseye that 24/7 cannot find the detailsl on their system!Reply from 247 Home Rescue4 days agoHi,We are sorry for this poor experience. We aim to deliver a great customer experience and, on this occasion, can see that we have let you down.We’ve tried to find your details in our system; unfortunately, we cannot find that information.Could you please share your reference number with us?

I was then charged £93 for a plumber to attend with ""special"" equipment and told I could have a refund if it wasn't used. Two days later a plumber arrived, but could not correct the problem saying the pipework was installed incorrectly when in fact a clip had simply come loose. He did not use any equipment. The company point blank refused to refund me, effectively calling me a liar, and apparently refusing to investigate further. i had the plumber's phone number so got him  to  contact 247 to confirm what I had told them. They offered a refund but no apology. I made a formal complaint and also obtained copies of my phone calls which their investigators showed no signs of having listened to. I was offered £30 compensation. In disgust I asked to cancel my policy, due to run for the rest of the year. They eventually agreed. "

Despite paying for their 24/7 call-out service for this year as a cheaper alternative to British Gas, I encountered significant issues when I needed urgent assistance, I guess you get what you pay for, lesson learnt. After an engineer did his annual service, he advised me the PCB had blown, although it was serviceable before his visit. With no heating or hot water, I tried reaching out to them through various channels, but to no avail. The lack of responsiveness and absence of an apology left me frustrated and disappointed.When my boiler was serviced, it was found to be faulty. I expected the repairs to be covered under my policy, but I was informed that certain parts were not included, and it was not economic to repair, which meant a new boiler. This misalignment between what was promised and the actual coverage was disheartening.I strongly advise potential customers to carefully consider their options before choosing 24/7 Boiler Care. While some positive reviews exist, my personal experience has left me questioning the value of their service.There communication is non existent and I feel completely ripped off. They have offered to install a new boiler for a price. I THINK NOT!"

18/07/2024,01/07/2024,Avoid,Update - I have now found out how 247 were never going to repair the boiler by using the term beyond economical repair. They gave a well below price of my boiler brand new and then stated it reduces in value by 10% each year. The insurance policy was therefore pointless and they need to provide much clearer information. If you have to claim good luck. Made a recent claim. Fully relaxed that the 247 insurance policy would cover the boiler defect. How wrong was I? We ended up paying the full repair price to 247 of £329 as well as the £75 excess.If your boiler is not brand new then pay a bit more and go with an honest repair company that doesn't harass you with the new boiler team and try to charge you £3000+. Also don't listen to these salespeople that harass you - they will say anything to try and get you to buy the new boiler (I'm hoping my recent calls are all recorded for the follow up complaint).

I have been with them for the last 2 yrs and had no problems until they done last service and identified a 'risk' which didn't exist before whilst I was with them and quoted £336 repair costs. They said I am not covered for this as per t&Cs but the fault occurred whist i was covered and I didn't exist a year ago when last service was carriedout. They said its at risk of breaking but not broken enough to fix it but they issued a service noticed to say not safe to use but safe enough not to repair.. I would say its all good to pay for 'cover' and think you are covered until something breaks down. I would afford and go with a reputible business instead. My Account reference is ms581022. You can't say its not accurate.

Since the service, the radiators now automatically turning on whenever I switch on the hot water. This issue went unnoticed for eight days, during which time it resulted in unnecessary heating and increased energy bills.When I contacted customer service to address this problem, I was met with confusion and a lack of understanding. They repeatedly questioned how servicing the boiler could affect the radiators, despite my clear explanation of the changes that occurred immediately after the service. Not only did they fail to provide a solution, but they also refused to acknowledge that the issue was caused by the recent servicing.Overall, I'm extremely disappointed with the service and the customer support provided.

The engineer went there and said it was not fully serviced.Well it was free service was included no one called me to book service.So they refused to repair it.3rd time I called them for a tumble dryer they took £30 excess after that refused to repair it by saying it was a non-economic repair.4 times I called them for a mains water emergency there was no water in the house my garden water stopper was broken and not releasing water. And guess? They said we don't cover mains water. I'm so frustrated with them why they don't clear on websites we don't cover these. Now even though they are not cancelling my policies and keep charging me by saying im in contact.So please stay away from this company 24/7 Home Rescue.Still waiting

I made complaint and  was given £10 refund has they contacted me once I complained that's all they would offer me but it ok when your not in and boiler man show up they can charge you up to £30 so don't seem very fair at all. My Year is nearly up end august and paid £19.99 a month not even had boiler service done yet, it is rebooked in but not hopeful. not very good service at all. Will look to go elsewhere after this experience worse I have had .The boiler service did get but i cancelled the renewal but since doing that they keep persistently calling me and I'm ignoring. "

After two texts this morning confirming engineer would be with me today I received a call 30 mins after the last confirmation text saying service would have to be rescheduled offering me a date in September which is just not acceptable as I am not renewing current contract on 19th August 2024 and September is not in this current contract.

Was asked to expose the pipe myself and send them evidence as I have to diagnose where the leak is and expose it before they can fix it! I am not a plumber and have a recent slipped disc but apparently I will find that in the small print on the penultimate paragraph of page 16 of terms and conditions.After I did what they asked and sent pictures they said sorry it is past 6pm will have to be tomorrow. Tomorrow came went and 6 phone calls later they said we did not receive my email. That is after they had confirmed they had. Two days later I am still chasing them as after locating my email they said the leak is not too visible on the pictures. Shocking company. False promises based on made up excuses.Will report to regulator as even trying to file a complaint with their manager the line got ""disconnected"" and did not call back."

As a disabled person what am I supposed to do. don’t trust home emergency 24/7 !!! Please bear in mind that the majority of the good reviews are for a boiler service I’ve had no problem with the boiler service but wait until you actually need them in a emergency then you will see the real service I’ve been with them for 4 yrs and it’s only now when I actually need help that I find them useless they have offered me £30 compensation I don’t want the money I need hot water.Update from 24/7 they want schedule an engineer for next week problem is I’m in hospital having surgery then I’ll probably be stuck in hospital because there is no hot water in the house making it uninhabitable but they are very sorry 😂oh and they offer to refund my £95 call out fee and he’s escalating my case I’ll get a response to that in 24 to 48hrs he’s going to make a note that I may not be able to answer due to anaesthetic 😂

I have encountered inconsistent information from their customer service representatives, each providing a different explanation for the delays and issues. I have been without hot water for nearly a week now because they keep dragging the days on , Additionally, I was sent an email with a quote for the repair, stating I would have to pay £250 out of pocket, despite my policy having a £0 excess.

11/08/2024,01/08/2024,Avoid this company,"I hope someone is fortunate enough to read this review. I’ve been a long-time customer of British Gas and HomeServe, and there's simply no comparison between them and this company. Trustpilot reviews may not reflect the true experience. This company asks for 5-star feedback after a pleasant conversation, but that’s before you actually need to make a claim or request a repair.Compared to industry standards set by companies like British Gas, this company falls short. While I’ve had my frustrations with British Gas, 24/7 Home Rescue is an outright nightmare. My tenant experienced a leak, and while British Gas had no issues with handling repairs directly, 24/7 Home Rescue created endless obstacles. They don't allow tenants to arrange repairs directly, dragging out the process to the point where my tenant was left stranded while I was on holiday.In contrast, British Gas once promptly repaired a leak under the bath without any fuss. But with 24/7 Home Rescue, they insisted we identify the source of the leak ourselves, asking us to open panels and send them videos. How are tenants or students supposed to do that, especially when the landlord lives two hours away? After endless discussions and phone calls, they never even showed up.When I requested a refund for the 10-11 months we had already paid, they flatly refused. Consider yourself lucky if you see this review and avoid this company at all costs. This nightmare happened 10 months ago, and I’m still appalled by their service."

Additionally, the engineer was not available immediately, with a wait time of 2-3 days and no guarantee of availability. This policy is misleading; it is not truly “Unlimited Call Outs” as it depends on the specific policy. The company, “Home Rescue,” did not provide the help I needed. They seem more focused on making money than on customer care. I wouldn’t recommend them as they play around with words and provide poor customer service. "

I wish I'd stayed with British Gas Home Care. Guys!... cheaper is not always better. Lesson!They say they cannot move a 'close to the wall' toilet in order to stop the water from constantly flushing. They sent 3 different 'engineers' to my house - and then each time they state that you have to wait in ALL DAY 8-6pm for them to visit (Even British Gas have sorted themselves out and will give you a window of when they will call... who has time to wait in all day for a silly engineer, when we are all so busy?) and if you miss the appointment they will charge you £30 for the pleasure!!. The 1st man just came and wandered around my house and didn't even attempt to flush the toilet to see why it was leaking. He reported the job was 'COMPLETE'! The 2nd man was much better and he said in his report that the TOILET NEEDS TO BE MOVED FORWARD to get to the rubber washer behind to sort out the issue.... SO THE COMPANY KNEW THIS .. so why did they then insist on sending another man a few days later to 'LOOK' at my toilet... He then said that the toilet needs to be moved forward to get the washer... 24/7 said he shouldn't do this - even though he was a qualified plumber and had all the tools and replacement parts in his van and the experience to do this. THEN  THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME £93 so they could move the toilet forwards. TALK ABOUT A SCAMMMMMM!!! THEY 'UPSELL' their services and things that should have been inclusive in getting the job done in such a shocking barefaced manner.BUYER BEWARE. I am a real life customer and I am tied into this company for the next 10 months and I won't be using them ... but they will still get my money by direct debit MONTHLY.Hey 24/7 NOT SO home care. I am really disappointed in your sales and your customer services. You sold me a damp squib. I need to be allowed to leave your company with NO false charges as you are not going to do my work, and will probably blacklist me as I have spoken out. But the truth needs to be told - so other vulnerable customers don't lose their hard earned cash coming to you. I've been a British Gas Home Care customer for many years, but thought cheaper was better. DON'T DO IT. its not better. Go direct to British Gas Homecare .. all the other startups are simply fakes and cant even live up to their standards with better staff and better customer services as BGH. I need the truth to be told. They have trumped up that i said this and that just to validate their refusal to let me leave and to refuse my complaint. So I have used my voice here to warn other customers of the issues Ive been left to deal with at the hands of this company. I BET IM NOT THE ONLY ONE TO SPEAK OUT WITH THIS COMPANY. But we know we can get 'great' reviews!!!Your response that the complaints dept. will get back to me... They already did. That's why I had to voice my honest and open review on here...This is what they said... 'We therefore are unable to waive your cancellation fee of £140 and maintain our position to repair your toilet if you are happy to pay for your toilet removal in the sum of £96.Please note that, under terms of our Complaints Procedure, this is our final response.'Its your final response... So this is my evidence for people to see. "

They will literally do everything they can to rip you off. Do not trust them as far as you can throw them and be prepared for ridiculous sales tactics to get you to buy a boiler.They treat customers so badly."

We called 247 who, after checking there wasn't any very young, elderly or vulnerable people at the address organised for an engineer to call. He rang when he was half an hour away and he tried to repair the boiler without success.  He told me the options and we decided to have a new boiler fitted by 247. The engineer came prompt at 8.a.m. a day later. He was very friendly, respectful and professional . He explained what he was needing to do and made sure I knew when the water was being turned off and on. He completed the work, cleaned up checked the boiler worked correctly and talked me through the controls. A very positive experience using 247 from first contact. Would highly recommend. "

15/08/2024,01/08/2024,Great service from the engineer,"I’ve had the plan since December, I’ve not needed an emergency call out but recently booked my annual service. The engineer kept me informed of his estimated arrival and was very friendly when he arrived. he serviced the boiler and gave me feedback about how good condition my boiler was in for its age (11 years). He did say that I’d receive a report of the service that I haven’t received yet (2 days later) so not sure what’s happened to that?? One thing I wasn’t happy with is a call I got the week before my service trying to upsell a central heating inhibitor (at a cost of £40!),  very hard sell on the phone, basically telling me that my system needed it otherwise my boiler could breakdown but I’ve never had to pay for it when British Gas serviced my boiler for the last decade so why do I need to pay for it now? I have a magnetic filter on my boiler which cleans the rubbish out and the engineer said when he finished how clean my system was so don’t feel pressured into paying extra for it if you also have a filter fitted. My response to the upsell call was if it’s needed as part of the service it should be included as part of the service so I’m not paying for it.. Other than the annoying upsell I couldn’t fault the service I received from the engineer and would highly recommend 247 for boiler cover…"
15/08/2024,01/08/2024,Great service but attempted upsell annoying,"I’ve had the plan with 247 since December 2023, I’ve not had to call them out for an emergency but recently booked an annual service. The engineer called me giving me an update of his arrival which was helpful and when he arrived he was very chatty and friendly. He serviced my boiler well and remarked that for its age it’s in great condition (11 years old). He did say that I would receive my service report (I thought by email) but I haven’t received anything (2 days later) so not sure what’s happened to that??? One thing that annoyed me was the call I received a week before, I assume from some sales team, trying to upsell me some central heating inhibitor (at a cost of £40!). The caller tried to scare me into getting the inhibitor saying that the boiler needed it otherwise it could breakdown but British Gas had serviced my boiler for the last decade and have never charged me for this, nor was it listed on my service paperwork, so I told the caller that if it’s needed as part of the service it should be included as part of the service so I’m not paying for it. My boiler has a magnetic filter fitted to it which clears the rubbish out of the system and the engineer remarked that my system was very clean so I took that as confirmation that I didn’t need to spend the extra money for the added chemicals. Other than the annoying attempted upsell I had a great experience with the service of the boiler and I couldn’t fault the engineer…"

The way he handled the call was so unprofessional and made it really hard to do a simple cancellation. I felt so pressured and was made to feel like I as in the wrong for cancelling my plan.

20/08/2024,01/08/2024,Not worth the money you pay for this…,Not worth the money you pay for this service. 247 hire a set of cowboy third party service providers and 4 of 5 times ensure they flag your boiler as risk. They would not honour your claim if an issue is identified at the time of boiler service even through your plan clearly mention all labour and parts covered. You are better off hiring a local gas engineer who would do a better job. I have remediation team who are happy to provide additional quotes by not render a proper service. I would strongly advise you stay away from this company. I have had a manager call me chewing her lunch in midst of being pre-occupied with another perhaps personal tasks to pay much attention to what I was saying. So much for customer service.

20/08/2024,01/08/2024,Change of service provider,"50 years plus as a customer of British Gas I was surprised on Sunday to receive my annual service renewal document which showed an increase of circa 30%. I phoned to see if there had been a mistake, but to no avail, apparently whilst I thought that I had not made use of the repair facility for 3 years, during the last routine service lubrication of a hive switch (less than a minute) constituted a callout. So sadly I cancelled the product.I searched the internet for a new provider at 77 years of age I was fearful that I had made a hasty decision however the price being asked left me no alternative. I need not of worried as I soon found Home Rescue, their site clearly set out a comparison with many other providers. Further documents clearly explained what was and what was not included in the package. So spoke over the telephone with a very friendly agent who was both knowledgeable, professional and above all humanistic. After answering some simple questions I signed up for home heating and kitchen appliance cover and was pleased to be offered a further 10% discount on the quoted price. (The welcome letter and terms and condition document arrived immediately by email as promised) So I end up paying less than currently let alone the 30% increase requested by BG. With the set up service offered by Home Rescue all my fears have been put to rest. So far seems a very professional organization, so as a pensioner (entered on their priority service schedule without any prompt from me) I have peace of mind for another year. Need not of worried should have changed supplier sooner."

Main issue with this company is that they cannot give you an estimated arrival time for the engineer, only the full day, no AM or PM so you have to hang around all day until the engineer rings you when he’s on his way to you.

Their customer service told me to expect the engineer between 8-12. At 07:30 24/7 messaged to say the service was booked but they couldn't specify a time! I waited in hope that the engineer would arrive but at 11:30 24/7 messaged to say the service would now happen between 12-18:00 so again I wait and wait. At 16:00 I get a call from Rachel Vixen who works out of a call centre in Pakistan to tell me the service would now need to be rescheduled. I have told her I want to cancel my policy and have whatever has been paid refunded. If I had a home emergency and this was what I could expect in an emergency then it fall short of what is expected both as a customer and as a business. Someone is supposed to be calling me by the end of today but I strongly doubt they will. Do yourself a favour and DON'T choose 24/7 for anything you may depend or rely on. I've experienced nothing but incompetence, inefficiency and chaos. This isn't what anyone wants AVOID these as it's nothing more than a SCAM. I've been offered nothing but lies, misdirection and this whole thing is nothing but a waste of money! "

Conducted service ruined my washing up bowl with a greasy black liquid he said came from draining boiler, however I have a cylinder also so draining should not be done how he did it. He shouted to say all done, I noticed the boiler was leaking water he said it was excess from his work ( no attempt to clean it ) he then left. My service record book was saturated in water and now ruined. The boiler was buzzing and smelt of burning. Within an hour the boiler was totally dead. Called to complain, call centre was awful and now Im told I have to wait another 24 hours for a call back. YOU WOULD NEVER have this awful service from British Gas you certainly get what you pay for. Uodate: you called me today to confirm my complaint and said someone would call to arrange a return visit of an engineer a a priority - no call received but had text to say to call you, I called on the number provided the person who took the call had no record of anything - I suggested they found out and called me back. STILL no call back from you it seems poor service runs throughout your business. "

I reported no hot water in my property. The pathetic service started there. Customer service keep you on phone for hours. There was a person called Hamza who is incompetent, takes very long to understand and respond to the most basic queries. Customer service is in some offshore location. He even called me at 7am in the morning. They should at least know to be mindful of the timezone of the country they work for. I asked them for a complaints process. They don't have a proper response to that. The technician said the valve for hot water is gone and needs replacement. He said he was putting that on his notes. As it turns out he lied to my face and his report apparently says he has fixed the problem. He did a manual override just as a temporary solution so we have hot water. That's no way to fix an issue. Now 247 want me to raise another request and charge me another call out fee. I have spent hours explaining to mindless people why it's not acceptable, but to no avail. And this has been ongoing for over a week now. In their policy they say they will deal with issues arising from visits withiin 14 days for free. This must be their tactic to stall so they charge callout fees again. I have been promised a call from someone in UK. I am hoping to get a call soon and to speak to someone sensible."

An electrician attributed it to our Boiler.On Monday, we asked for help from 24/7, our insurer, paid £75 for a boiler engineer call-out. He was absolutely useless and confirmed there was a problem of “reverse polarity”and added this to his call sheet.He then said that we need another engineer! We paid another £45 for an engineer for a callout, but he opted to call us on FaceTime to view the Boiler. He then said he would call the Insurer to request a Plumber for us on Saturday but we have never received the call? A further call to company today, Saturday, confirmed no action before Monday, and another charge of £45. I am now arranging for a private Valiant technician to call. As far as 24/7 are concerned, a letter regarding a claim or legal action is my next .  I Would not recommend this company because some of their staff work from home/office and there is background noise. We are pensioners aged 82 and have had no hot water or shower facilities since Sunday 25 August, and have to carry a kettle of hot water upstairs, when needed! We are also both DISABLED!Today, Wednesday, we were asked to call you the claims line. The first person I spoke with could offer us a service in October and there would be another charge. We rejected this offer. Later we received another call and this time an engineer will be coming to our home for a service on Wednesday.Very pleased to say that 24/7 pulled out all the STOPS on Tuesday by sending us a professional engineer who quickly identified three problems requiring replacements. The boiler was then written off and we received vouchers for £495 towards a new boiler if  provided by 24/7. The company are also going to refund the £75 and £45 charges. "
31/08/2024,01/08/2024,Unfortunately I have to write a…,"Unfortunately I have to write a negative review. My boiler was working fine until the engineer came to do the annual service last week. I have been with 247 for a while now and they have always been really good up until this point. The following morning I woke up to all the radiators being on full blast upstairs even though the heating was turned off. I double checked the thermostat and my cosy system and hoped it was just a blip. The following morning the same thing happened. I called the service centre as I have a service plan. The same engineer came out and said I needed a diverter valve. I received a call from 247 to say that I needed to pay £95 excess plus £108 for a system drain down. As you can imagine I was not happy as everything had been fine before the service. I then asked my partner to have a quick look. The electric motor for the diverter valve had been removed and once this was put in place everything was working well again. I complained and said I wanted to cancel my policy as I have absolutely no faith in the company. They carried out a service and left it not working properly. They said if I wanted to cancel the policy I would have to pay £84!  I am not happy about this as their service, which caused the issue, could have cost me over £200 for something that did not need doing. "

04/09/2024,01/09/2024,I would avoid,"Until my renewal date I would have gave a higher rating but this is definitely the worse company I have had to deal with when it comes to a renewal. Firstly they tried to hike my monthly payment to £16.47 from £5.49, I know this is common practice but in the renewal email it stated ""If you have an increase, this may be due to a claim you made or because your cover may include a boiler which is now older than the age thresholds of 6 or 11 years, when boilers often need more repairs"" my problem is my boiler is 2 years old and I have never claimed, the only service i have used was a boiler service which is included.So because of this I ring them to cancel as I can get the same cover for around £6-£7. I speak to a man for a few mins and he tells me he can drop the cover to £12.99, I politely refuse and ask to cancel. He then puts me on hold to speak to his supervisor. When he comes back he tells me he can drop it to £10.99, I politely refuse and ask to cancel to which he puts me on hold again then comes back and says he can drop it to £8.99. at this point I'm getting a little annoyed and telling him I'm finding it hard to stay polite because you are not listening to me, I just wanted to cancel the damn thing. He says ok I will proceed with the cancellation and puts me on hold again. He comes back and says my supervisor has said I can drop the cover to £7.99 but the cover won't be as comprehensive. At this point I'm pretty annoyed and I get a bit more annoyed with him. I tell him to cancel it and he says ok I will proceed with the cancellation and puts me on hold again. He comes back and says that he's about to cancel but his supervisor has said he can drop it to £7.99 for the same cover. I told him that if he would have offered me this in the first place I probably would have said yes to save me having to switch covers but after all this Im definitely cancelling. I was pretty annoyed when I said this so he finally cancelled. This process to around 30mins when it should have took 5. My advise would be don't be drawn in by there low price for the first year as they will hike it more than 200% for the second year and make it really hard for you to leave. As you can see by my review they did not need to hike it that high but they do it hoping you will just take it. Just another Extortionate insurance company. "

After a week, usual sub contractor showed up late in the day, stating after 30 seconds of cover being off boiler that a new fan would be required. Thinking he would return after a couple of days with the part, a week elapsed. Contacting call centre, I was informed that owing to my boiler being 15 years old it was valued at £205.89 and therefore written off as the part and labour was in excess of £450.I was informed that boilers depreciate by 10% a year and everything is covered in the T&C’s. Obviously if I had been informed at the beginning of contract this year that my lovely boiler was effectively worthless, I would not have renewed as any job would be more than the boiler is worth.

Since the service I have no hot water, I have called everyday for the past 8 days and each time promised someone would call me back... they don’t. Each person I speak to I get a different story and telling me they will log or continue processing a claim. Not sure what I pay for monthly if they think 8 days+ is acceptable to be without hot water or any communication. Edit: The fact you can reply to your Trustpilot reviews straight away but still not have called me or sorted out my hot water says everything. "

After the engineer had finished, he spent 2 hours on the phone outside, so they don't seem to be overloaded or overbooked.An independent engineer said that the boiler had not been serviced properly - no wonder as 247 people only run safety checks and clean the condenser. Their aim is to condemn your boiler and persuade you to buy a new one from them."

I have had relatives waiting in all day and they cancel or do not turn up. they have a £95 excess which they do not tell you about when signing up. This company is a total waste of time. Further to this post, my complaint has been what the company call 'investigated' and I have received a passive aggressive reply which failed to address at least two of my complaints, not to mention the degrading way in which I was spoken to by a call handler. Their reply has further enhanced my opinion that this company is to be avoided at all costs.

Being lied to over the phone about the reported issues and when the engineers finally did arrive diagnosing the issue they didnt report it back to the office so the whole process started again. Save your money for when the break downs that do happen and arrange a trusted tradesman. First registered the issue at our property on the 14/05/2024 the matter was finally resolved on the 09/08/2024. Imagine the time spent over almost 3 months to try and resolve this issue. “24/7 home rescue” is nothing more than a brand name.When we cancelled the membership due to poor service we still had to pay a number of months to remove ourselves from the contract. Even then its not worth the hassle of trying to arrange an appointment and request a refund with this tragic company.

11/09/2024,01/09/2024,Poor Service,"I hve been a customer of this company for over 5 years but had not called them in an emergency. They are called 24/7 Home Rescue but what is not made clear is that it is the call centre and online logging that is 24/7 but they can take up to 48 hours to arrange an appointment. I had an electrical problem very early on a Sunday morning and I had no working electrical sockets in my house. I logged the call on line. Two hours later I called the company and was told they are trying to get an engineer to me. Two hours later I called again as by now my phone was losing charge, I had no means of cooking or boiling a kettle. I am an elderly widow who lives on her own. I was never asked if  I had means of heating, cooking etc. I was told 'it is a Sunday you know' and they would not be able to get an engineer out. I organised my own electrician that day who resolved the fault. I complained to the company about the service and received a very condescending email reply saying that they could have offered me an appointment for the Tuesday but I had already resolved the issue. I would have been without any electrical appliances for 2.5 days at that point. I was offered a refund of one months premium but this offer was withdrawn when I said I wanted to cancel my policy.  I can understand that emergencies have to be prioritised but I was left with no electrical appliances, no landline phone (as linked to the broadband) and a flat battery on my mobile phone. Very disappointed by their lack of any care for their vulnerable clients."

I have just spent an hour on the phone to ask why none of my emails have been answered and why they continue to reinstate and collect the direct debit after my wife and I cancelled the policy back in May. Two engineers came out to service our boiler, which was working fine, and condemned it, stating that the flu had been installed incorrectly. The boiler had been fitted by a Corgi registered heating engineer and serviced regularly for 6 years. As soon as the engineers left the boiler stopped working. I noticed that the water sensor had been removed and left on the washing machine. We were left without heating and water for two days and had to get another heating engineer out to fix the boiler that had been broken by 24/7 'engineers'. This engineer also stated that the flu was fine and installed correctly. My wife and I have sent numerous emails, none of which have been relied to and have just been told on the phone that it will cost us over £80.00 to cancel the policy. A more cynical person might think  this company condemns boilers to install new ones. A truly appalling experience. Do not use. "

He visit my rental property just once throughout my 2-3yrs with them for annual check of boiler. I provide my consent to come to my property.When he passed to the cooker he said to my tenants the cooker is no longer safe to use. Fair enough. He can cut the back wire gas and not the main pipe on the wall which make it incredible unfair. After paying extra to the installer of curry's for my new cooker, he was unable to resolve the issue since he stated that cutting the pipe on the wall isn't right because it's already cut at the back connection..I rang the 24/7 to fix back what they've done oh they're not bothered because I immediately cancelled my insurance to them beginning 6th of October because they just took money from me this month. I think some engineers at 24/7 were just ungrateful and racist if your Asian."

13/09/2024,01/09/2024,Do not ever use this company,Do not ever use this company. We never had any issues with our previous boiler. A repair to the flue was recommended and as our boiler was getting on we were advised it would be best to put this towards a new boiler. Stupidly we listened to their advice.They did not inspect our pipe work properly and fit a boiler where we have consistently been left without heating and hot water over the last year. Forced us to spend £599 on a power flush we didn’t need; although later refunded when they admitted they were wrong. Won’t put the correct pipe work in place. Now state we have to be left without heating and hot water until our bathroom is completed despite the same error code occurring as before we started this work. They could not even tell us they wouldn’t be attending until I called them to chase this up. Still waiting for a call back from a manager to make a complaint. We have had 11 visits this year alone which has impacted our work as we had to take time off. We just want a working boiler but don’t think they will ever be able to supply this to us. We will be taking this complaint to the finance company and the Financial Ombudsman to try and get our money back so we can get a boiler fitted by someone who knows what they are doing.

It then takes them up to 48 hours to book someone in. The only time slot you will be given is 8am- 6pm with the engineer giving you a 30 min eta, anytime during that window. With our last supplier you paid the call out fee when booking the engineer slot which was a 4 hr window rather than 10!The engineer was ok and fixed the issue but did leave a bit of mess.

However, since cancelling both policies after the tenants took over my insurance on one property, and the other property was sold, I have felt absolutely inundated with texts and emails urging me to reinstate the policies. Even when I rang up to explain the cancellations, I again had to listen to a standard script about “being left without boiler cover.” It just seems to be a robotic one size fits all process and I wouldn’t use this company again based on my experience.

Having been promised an appointment for September 12 when the engineer failed to turn up - for the second time - I posted a critical review which drew the usual response apologising and saying they were looking into it.I also however got a promise that an engineer would be with me at some point during the day on September 13. Having waited in all day for this to happen, nothing did - there was no communication, no phone call nor e mail and 48 hours on still no contact.I have written to them today and assume they will respond at some point offering yet another date requiring us to stay in the whole of that day. I have no confidence in this company’s promises and strongly advise anyone thinking about using their services not to proceed as they clearly do not deliver for their customers even on the routine tasks such as boiler services so how on earth can they help in an emergency situation.

Then say in our terms and conditions if we identify any issues you need to pay for them before we repair anything as part of the insurance.Honestly you're better off going with another company. I've used others in the past who have just come and fixed the problem without making a fuss or causing a hassle.I wish i never went with them, what a waste of money and just a real headache.Also if you want to cancel they will charge you the full contract amount upfront.

I’m quite confused how is this possible. Surely the boiler age will go on when the boiler was installed and started working and not from the day it was born! My advice to all the people who are thinking of changing their boiler, do not go with this company. You will get shafted. If they sell you a so called ‘NEW’ boiler which was manufactured 10 years  ago. I am sure you will get a measly £195 if your boiler breaks down in 2 years. Question any company you go with on how the age of boiler criteria works before you buy a policy! I won’t be renewing my policy with this company again. Lesson learnt! "

You can source a local person in that time framework.They call themselves 24/7 as they answer your call 24/7 but can not respond to a home emergency.You are better off paying British Gas a few extra pounds and in exchange you will at least get home emergency cover.They have one Gas Safe / Plumber covering the whole of the Southwest from Cornwall up to Gloucester that is why they can not respond to your call out.All their call agents are from abroad (Pakistan) so it is hard to understand them. The company is based in Burnley and they may have many engineers up North but nothing South.Sign up to this company at your Peril. Unfortunately i have to give 1 star as the option of 0 stars is not available. Will be cancelling my contract with this awful company.All other reviews on this site are fake do not believe them
20/09/2024,01/09/2024,Boiler engineer didn't show up for the second time ,"Unfortunately, if there were 0 stars, this would be my score. This is the second time that I scheduled a boiler service and the engineer doesn't attend. I had to schedule my whole week of work to stay home and by 5 pm no one showed up. I called the customer service, who gave me the third party company's telephone number. They didn't pick up the phone. So, I called the customer service again to be informed that they didn't know what happened and would investigate. If I wasn't home, there would be a £30 pound fine, however, when they don't show up for the second time, I get nothing. The app doesn't work, the chat is an AI tool not helpful at all and the tracking my engineer button stated on the chat doesn't even exist.   I'm so frustrated and disappointed."

I have literally just gotten off the phone with one:*Waqas who was with the Client Retentions & Service Dept, at the offshore centre in Pakistan"" who spoke with me with politeness n courtesy throughout the 10 to 15 min call.I was ready to leave this company for a rival until Waqas persisted with his series of ever improved offers (going through and having me reject 3 x earlier offers), ultimately leading me to settle happily for the 4th offer, which involved the same price that we are currently paying this year of £19.99 per year, with No Excess and Identical Service Plan levels, as before...when we come to renew in early October.It was a worthwhile bargaining n negotiation call and I'm grateful for one to have been able to speak with such a patient - genuinely polite and sincere young gent in the form of Waqas today (and his manager/supervisor) who really seemed to cherish existing clients (once one haggles a dash ofc naturally  ;) )Company assets they are, Waqas and his manager.Happy to stay with 24/7 Home Rescue for another year (their engineers tend to be very polite and capable too, I've found in the 4-6 years I've renewed with them)."

22/09/2024,01/09/2024,Buyer Beware!,"Was with this company for 3 years. I gave a 5-star review last year mostly because of the amazing engineer the company sent to service my boiler. Fast forward a year later, boiler service due and carried out. Different calibre of engineer; not as personable or capable/competent as the young lad sent last year due to the fact that after the service, my boiler started making these awful, scary noises mostly when the heating was turned on. We didn’t catch on at first because we didn’t use the heating immediately after service so the first time I noticed was about 9-10 days after the service. I managed to contact them after it had occurred a handful of times (I am also a professional who works full-time, and travels a fair bit and it took another 3/4 days to get around to calling them -once the issue had occurred multiple times). I was told I was outside the 7-day window to report faults after a service. However, no one had reminded me of this at the point of booking said service, engineer hadn’t given me this information immediately after service and I didn’t receive my service paperwork after service (although even when I got it, there wasn’t a reminder on there to contact them if  any problems within a week) so they effectively had breached their own T&Cs. If any or all of these had happened, we’d have run the heating immediately a handful of times to make sure everything was fine after the service. Anyway, they refused to send an engineer out and their defence was that the contract (which I’d entered into some 6 months prior) gave that information about the 7-day window. Thus, their ridiculous expectation is for the customer to have a photographic memory and to have memorised every line of the policy (bearing in mind this wasn’t emphasized verbally at any point) so I was expected to have remembered or even been aware of the 7-day window from looking at pages of T&Cs 6 months prior to the service). I tried to argue that this was an unrealistic expectation and that the customer should get a reminder at the time of booking a service/engineer should mention after service, and then ppw received immediately after  should also highlight this. They refused to send an engineer back out, instead advising they’d give me a ‘discount’ and charge me £65 for a visit. My boiler had been working absolutely fine before service, no complaints throughout the life of the policy, and hadn’t expressed any concerns about it prior to service. We’re also a vulnerable household. But instead of coming out to check what their engineer had done to my boiler, they used the get-out-of-jail-free card of policy T&Cs. We also discovered that whatever he’d done or not done correctly, messed with the thermostats somehow.  I went to the Financial Ombudsman which is effectively now a toothless bulldog, and the outcome was that they couldn’t speak to what had happened with, and after the service, but the policy said blah blah blah. Needless to say, I have now cancelled my policy. Whilst I was going back and forth with 247, I had to get a qualified mate to check my boiler, to at least give me peace of mind that it wasn’t about to explode any minute, considering the awful racket it was making after the so-called service. So, buyer beware. "

And the jocke is they offered us £30 compensation.Now we have to take a loan to pay for an expensive new boiler to replace our boiler which was like new and (247 insurance engineer decided to damage it run away

23/09/2024,01/09/2024,Avoid at all costs!,"They are getting 1 star as there is no option to give no stars.  They came out and did a first service and from the time the engineer attended and left, the boiler started to act up and the pressure would keep going up and my hot water cut out.  A few days after the engineer left, I called to say I was having issues with the boiler and that the settings weren't working and they said they would send someone out but this never happened.  I rang them twice about this and the first time they said they called and didn't get me (there was no missed calls on my phone). Second time they said it would be a new claim and I would have to pay a call out fee but finally agreed to send someone out after I told them this was still the claim after their engineer had come out.  To date no one came out for that concern.  My boiler subsequently started leaking and I called them and had to pay a £95 call out fee only to be told they needed to strip down the boiler to fix it and I had to pay another £150 as this was not covered in my plan with them.  I did this, they came after much back and forth.  I was out of the country and left someone at the property to give them access and called and provided them with the contact information for the individual, but I kept being called and messaged when I was away trying to bury my family member.  When they finally decided to come out, they were telling me between 8 and 6pm which was utterly unacceptable as some of us do work. They finally agreed to between 8 - 12pm, then on the day they should attend, twice on the day they cancelled the engineers, first saying the engineer was sick and then that the other engineer had an emergency.  Buckets of water were being emptied and they were telling me they couldn't send  anyone out for two further days. It was only after I asked for the matter to be escalated that I was able to get them to come out.....all of this whilst abroad, as they continued to ring me and message throughout, even though I kept telling them to ring the number for the person at the house.  The engineer who finally came out claimed he messaged me an hour before he was due to get to the property but I never got that text.  He looked at the boiler and decided it would cost £500 to repair (which they didn't cover of course) and recommended that I get a new boiler.  They then quoted for a new boiler but could only offer one brand which they were obviously working with.  I advised I would like a choice of brands, but was told they can offer nothing if not the brand they were touting.They are in my view dishonest and misrepresent what they offer, whilst trying to upsell you things when they come out to service your boiler. I now feel like they tampered with my boiler to get me to buy a new one. My boiler was being serviced every year since purchasing it and prior to them attending to do their service, I had never had any issues with it, having put it in new 8 years before.  I would never recommend 24/7 to even my worst enemy."
23/09/2024,01/09/2024,Loyal Customer. RIPPED OFF! Avoid...,"I have been a loyal customer of 24/7 for over 7 years, paying a monthly premium for their Home Care Plus Package. Every year I got a boiler service as part of the package, but never called them out for anything else. However, last week my hot water wasn't working due to low pressure. An engineer attended my property, part of the package,  and fixed the issue within seconds. Miraculously when he looked at his next job, he surprisingly stated that its my house and due for an annual service. This is where it all cam tumbling down. He came out with a list of things that were needed service the boiler, at an additional cost of £328.00, not covered by my premium cover policy. He also stated that if they open up the boiler, there could be other issue and could cost an additional £800 on top (£1,228.00) in total. I was shocked, given I was paying a premium for their most prestigious package for years and they would not fix my boiler, as it doesn't cover the parts or labour cost. I then suggested, in that case I have new bolier cover with 24/7 which they put me to a tea of sales people, that stated the cover is not for a new boiler but £400 towards a new one. I asked for the cost an they were trying to push me into an unheard of model costing 4 times more, even with the £400 discount than any other company ( i received several quotes). With all this I asked to CANCEL the policy as I thought it was absurd they were ripping me off as a loyal customer. Im then told it will cost £289.00 to cancel the policy as I had a annual service, which was part of the policy. Ultimately, I paid a premium for years, to be ripped of and when I want to leave they continue to request more money. Their customer service team is based in India and they say many things that are not true to keep your business. REMEMBER, you are paying a monthly premium which is contractual under their T&Cs they don't tell you about, and practically everything that will go wrong with a boiler or heating is not covered. You will pay more! AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

It took 8 visits including the service to sort out two simple problems.3. I resorted to phoning after 8am each day to try to get a better idea of the schedule of the engineer to find out whether it would be a morning or afternoon visit. I kept being told that it was an all day appointment. On two occasions I was given an indication of expected arrival times.This meant the tenant had 8 days to wait in.4. The security questions were the same each time and exceptionally tedious.5. I found it difficult to understand the person answering my calls, their spoken English was very poor in most cases.6.

I have accepted this offer and now waiting for Baxi to phone me. However I was advised that Baxi might refuse to repair the boiler and deem it to be unrepairable!

Got absolutely no help on the telephone and found the operator extremely rude and unhelpful, made to feel I was lying which was not nice.

They were only interested in collecting monthly direct debits.1st call out for a shower tap problem was declined.2nd call out for kitchen drain blockage could not be fixed by an unskilled cowboy sent. I have to do this privately with a handyman. The annual boiler service request took the person sent three minutes only to dust the boiler with a brush.Thirdly, the call out for no hot water and heating again was misdiagnosed as a broken pump, so boiler replacement was recommended by another unskilled person sent by 247. I had to cancel my policy and called out the W/Bose engineer privately. The boiler was diagnosed as low pressure due to leakage hence no hot water and heating. The leaking spot was tightened and the boiler was repressurised. Heating and hot water are now restored. The engineer said nothing was wrong with the boiler.

Then they asked me to investigate the issue (knowing that I am not a plumber!) asking me to send them pictures which I did. I called again after I had to turn the main water supply to avoid more damages. After calling them continuously and me trying to explain the severity and the inconvenience of not having water in the house especially that I have a disabled child and we couldn’t use any water! It was disaster and after me calling few times they refused to send a plumber saying that they don’t cover repairing leak from a main pipe!!!! How is that even possible! I explained that it is a 15mm copper pipe and it is not the main water pipe! They didn’t even apologise or offer a solution. I had to hire a private plumber on an emergency basis and the leak was done in less than 10 minutes! I was fuming and will not renew or recommend this company to anyone. Be wary! There was a pinhole in the kitchen pipe and was refused help when they know that I was panicking and couldn’t have any water all day!!!"

I’ve decided to stick with the call centre to cancel with the first handler deciding to deal with this by telling me they are super busy at 9:30 in the morning and they would call me back. No call back in 30 minutes. I’ve called back finally getting through to the correct department and once again the calls dropped out.

Firstly, this company will get you to write a review as soon as you have signed up to their policies making most of the reviews on here false. Secondly, they use Indian call centres which have a poor grasp of the English language. I rang up to make a claim on some pipework which cost me £95 excess. The man on the phone whose English was poor at best, assured me that I was covered for the pipe work as I wanted to make sure that before paying a hefty excess. The engineer turned up for ten minutes and wrongly diagnosed a faulty pipe, it turned out to be the washing machine!! Then I was told I was not covered. 24/7 refused to issue me a refund for the policy. I have two policies and will be cancelling both due to the poor service."
30/09/2024,01/09/2024,This company is a complete rip off,"This company is a complete rip off! I took out boiler insurance with them and during my annual boiler service they told me if my boiler broke down they would not be able to get parts for it so I should buy a new boiler. They scaremonger you into believing your boiler will break down during winter and they won't be able to fix it. I started the process of getting a new boiler and paid them a deposit. I then did some research and realised they were charging a lot more than other company's for a new boiler and the new boiler insurance was a 10 year direct debit which they did not tell me about. They also did not tell me that I was entitled to a £250 discount as I had a policy with them. I cancelled the new boiler but the company did not give me back my £700 deposit. I phoned them several times and they said the refund had been processed and it was my bank that was  keeping the funds from me. It was all lies, no refund was processed so I opened a dispute with my bank and got my money back. All the people that work for this company are in on the scam and are just trying to sell products. Don't waste your money go with another company!"

01/10/2024,01/10/2024,Scammers!!,Had to put a claim in last week as no hot water. They were fast in getting in touch and got an engineer out same day... I had to pay £95 excess pay before the engineer even came out... they're saying it's a call out fee but it's not cos on my contract it says excess pay: £95 plus just seen a review last week saying they got charged £60 call out fee.. why is mine more?? Anyway engineer came out (lovely guy by the way) told me the issue and then said I'm not covered so he left and I ended up getting a local plumber in to fix it as I knew these company's would charge alot more... I then tried to get my 95 refunded as the work wasn't fixed.. I messaged and emailed 3 times no reply.. so rang today to be told it's none refundable!! Why??? I'm paying that to fix my boiler which wasn't fixed so that's my money! And not forgetting you have scammed me paying me £35 extra if it was supposedly a call out fee! I've never had any problems until now so that's me done with this company I'll be going else where. What a joke scamming a single mother of 3 kids!

Didn't attend, again.I wouldn't mind but as no time for the visit is given I have to be available from 08.00 to 19.00 - hanging around all day just waiting - infuriating. And still they argued.I attempted to cancel the policy but fell foul of the contract small print - you must give 30 days notice. So I have to pay an ""administration fee "" plus pay another month's premium to get out of the contract.My advice ? What do you think !I've signed up with British Gas - compare. JJARef WS0217424Had to use a GMAIL account to submit this."

I disputed this and they then proceeded to slate the boiler manufacturer (Worcester Bosch) and advised it was either broken already or the boiler manufacturers fault. I had multiple conversations with them over a week and was then passed to their complaints dept.

As it turns out engineer was not told about inhibitor but said we did not need it replaced yet as boiler only a few years old.So I have asked them to refund the money they took from me and will see if this is straightforward. I’m hoping there are no problems and refund is swift but we will see.Still waiting on refund a week after my boiler service. Also received email asking me to call regards my boiler service but when I called no one knew anything about it. Confused…"

Even though I pay over £16 pcm I had to pay an excess of £95 which I knew aboutThe engineer came the following day and said the pump had gone on the boiler and said it wasn’t economical to repair even though the boiler is only 7 years old. He left me saying I would get a call from the office.The next day a salesman told me I could get a new boiler for £2500.I compared with a local firm who offered me the same service with a far better make of boiler go the same price.So to sum up I have paid out for years and when I needed  repair I was charged £95 and was left high and dry.I am now cancelling all my policies and going local.

I took time off work to stay home for an engineer to arrive, I get no txt or call for 30min warning, or arrival ETA likethey advertise. Instead, you get 1 missed call from a random number, which when you immediately call back, no one answers! I then txt random no to ask who it is?! No reply! Also, no one has come to your door either, so you’re left thinking maybe the engineer is still on their way and that was the 30min warning?! 15mins go by, still no reply from txt’s, or now multiple phone messages to the random no! You also can’t get through to the main office! When you finally do get to speak with an agent, they won’t help me!! Even though, I, the tenant booked, and paid for this emergency appointment yesterday!!!.. They spoke to me with no issues then, when I was paying up!!!.. but they won’t speak to me now?!!! (convenient much?!), OBVIOUSLY A SCAM they do!!!Even when you explain that you believe a driver may be trying to contact you right now, at this moment! Or perhaps is lost, and can’t find your address?! NOPE, after 3 calls with different agents NO ONE would help me! Still no one has come to my front door either?! I end up having to get my internationally based Landlord to call this company, who was then told apparently the driver waited for 25mins then left?! WHEN?! WHERE?! Why didn’t they answer their phone, call meback, or the basic call out engineer method of ACTUALLY KNOCKING ON THE FRONT DOOR?!!!lMy landlord has now had to reschedule the appointment to the next day, and pay an another fee!! This is CRIMINAL!!! I have no heating! I took time of work to wait in for no one to arrive!The only explanation is that this company FEIGN ENGINEER ARRIVALS TO DOUBLE CHARGE THEIR CUSTOMERS, LYING ABOUT THEIR ARRIVAL!WHAT A SCAM AND HUGE WASTE OF MY TIME!!!

04/10/2024,01/10/2024,Damaged Boiler Hinges,"We have had cover with this company since 2020 without incident. In 2022 we had a new boiler installed by Bosch. The boiler was serviced the next Summer 2023 by this company.  The engineer that serviced the boiler was lovely and very chatty, at the end of the service she told that everything was fine and there were no issues. Last week the second boiler service was carried out, this time the engineer advised that the hinges on the front panel were broken, this was a shock as this panel had not been touched since the service the prior year during the boiler service.When he was done the bottom left side of the front panel had slipped and you could see a visible gap, he said that it needs to be repaired asap as this could compromise the function of the boiler. He also told me that if you're not familiar with this brand of boiler and don't take care when removing the panel, you will snap the hinges. I received a call from customer service the next day, they were providing a quote to repair the hinges it was going to cost us £129! I questioned this and was told that the previous engineer had noted the broken hinges in her report, funny she never mentioned this to me and I never received a follow up call to have this rectified, which is what I thought the boiler service was for;  find and fix any faults, otherwise what are we paying for? Outrageous! Because they use contractors any damage caused when servicing a boiler would be a chargeback to the engineer, which is why she didn't mention it to me and made it seem that this was the way she found it. In the end we contacted Bosch and they arranged to have the hinges replaced. Needless to say I've cancelled this cover as I can't tust the integrity of their contractors. We will be paying more for Bosch to carry out the annual service, but at least we will have peace of mind."

I wanted the policy to cancel on a specific date and was told that I'd have to call back on that date to cancel. I called back on that date and I was instead told it would be £200 to cancel. While I was with them, I had a boiler service reminder for May, but then they could only give me options in June/July/August. Totally useless in all interactions, and very aggressive when you try to cancel.For 247: the reference number I used was WS440904.Update as of 27/10/2024: I've now received 3 texts and multiple emails from 247 home rescue reminding me that my direct debit has been cancelled and encouraging me to rejoin.

This didn't resolve the problem. I rang home 24/7 again who sent out a different engineer. He was here for 5mins, told me he wasn't happy with the state of the new valve and ordered a completely new part and off he went. 6 hours later we noticed water on the outside of the house even though it was a dry sunny day. Went to check the boiler and water was leaking everywhere inside and through the outside pipes. 6 hours this had gone on for since the engineer visited! So within a 5 minute visit this said engineer had damaged my boiler causing a massive leak, and he decided to leave without saying anything other than he's ordered a new part! Rang home 24/7 who aren't 24/7 at all. Told me I had to just wait for the new part to come in! Couldn't care that an engineer had just damaged my boiler and water damaged my property. Now left without heating or hot water with young children and a baby in the house. Told I have to wait 24hours for the issue to be picked up and then I'll get a phone call back. So I have no heating, no hot water and a massive leak! But I've gotta wait 24 hours to for a call back to see if it can even be fixed?

He left tell ing me this was a terrible service he could not even change the fuse for £50! He left still no heating or hot water! He said he would contact 24/7 and see if they would pay up as I have boiler and central heating parts and labour on my plan. But 24/7 have to then decide if they will honour the claim. Left at that waited Sunday nothing Monday nothing so I checked the app. It said"" claim closed all done""This made my blood boil so I called hours of trying to get through to the right person. I asked why as my claim been closed you haven't done any repairs?""Your claim is open I just opened it again""Was the answer so they had closed it I asked""No I have opened it now for you""If it was not closed you wouldn't have to open it would you I replied nothing came back!I asked why £50 why did they not just do the job ?"" The fitter allways comes out to assess the problem then we decide if we can fix it"" Was the reply.So I have paid £20 odd a month for 12 months and you will think about fixing my boiler. What's 24-7 about that I asked. The fitter finished Saturday it's now Monday and if I had not chased this up I would of been waiting for a repair and gas fitter! That was never going to come because you closed my claim?Answer was even more bizarre 🙄 ""We are not 24-7 our help line is""I asked did the fitter contact 24-7 on Saturday?""No our offices are close at evenings and weekends he couldn't ""So your closed and didn't get contacted by the fitter then but you closed my claim""NO your claim isn't closed I just told you I have opened it again for you""If you just opened it again then it was shut by 24-7 then without doing any work or fixing problem this needs fixing ASAP I'm disabled and no heating or hot water the boiler fault code reads FD(No flow)And shuts down you know we have had two nights below freezing 🥶 and that's all you can do.""I will escalate your claim we will contact you""Can I have a direct number to you to save waiting and going through India to get a answer.

On one occasion whilst on the phone to them I suffered anxiety attack because we were going around in circles with the conversation hence I ended the call. The call left me unwell for a few days.

Despite having a policy that clearly includes parts and labour, the company has been doing everything possible to avoid a valid claim.We have been without hot water for 6 days, making everyday tasks extremely difficult. Rather than helping us resolve this urgent issue, 24/7 Home Rescue has delayed the process and failed to provide any reasonable explanation. It feels like they are intentionally avoiding their responsibilities under the policy, leaving us frustrated and stressed.I would not recommend 24/7 Home Rescue to anyone looking for reliable home coverage. They do not act in good faith, and their focus seems to be on avoiding rather than helping customers when they are in need.",

09/10/2024,01/10/2024,Service issues ,Have been with this company for 18 months since I moved in to my home. I renewed my cover / service plan in February 2024. My annual boiler service was due in September 2024 which was booked with no issues with the company however when the day came around the engineer did not turn up. I was told by a customer service advisor this was down to the fact they do not cover my type of boiler. This is In spite of the fact they serviced it the previous year and also knew the make and model before letting me renew my policy and letting me book my service. Eventually this was resolved and rearranged for a date a week later only for the exact same thing to happen. Again I faced a lengthy phone call to get to the bottom of the issues for it to be booked for a 3rd time today 09/10/24 for again no engineer to turn up and for the customer service team to tell me the same story yet again.To make matters worse they have also charged me £40 for an inhibitor that they haven't even been on my property to use. Avoid at all costs.

The answer was that the engineer has very urgent jobs in the city and can't make it. After explaining that I had to take an unpaid day off and that this is been booked ages ago and also it's not normal, I have been reassured that the engineer will come today after all.16:18 PM no text, call or engineer yet.17:04 PM still nothing. I feel like I spent my day on house arrest...17:35 there is no sign of my appointment being honoured today. The engineer has to call 30 min prior the appointment so it's a no for today...Shameful...Update 18:00 : called them a totally incompetent person answered my call, no apologies, no sorry, no nothing. All I could get from her was that a supervisor will call me back tomorrow...If I would've missed the appointment the company would have charged me a fee.So I think it's only fair that they would pay me my working day that I missed.Better than that this should actually be mandatory so that no service provider mocks their customers."

To double check it had been done I telephoned the day before the appointment. The Engineer turned up at 8.30am. I'm on my third phone call of today to chase it up with people promising to call me back but actually doing nothing, and I still can't tell tenants if the engineer is going to turn up after 2 and if they need to be there. They are fuming and so am I, 24/7 keep saying that if it is re-booked it will be an 'anytime between 8 and 6' and that somehow I have to make the tenants be there or get there myself to be at the property all day. Utterly useless to landlords, in fact worse than useless."

Then said he can’t go up into the loft without me getting it boarded up and when I said I will go up he then decided to go up there to turn off the water. Then he left the property as soon as I left the property he left informing my tenant he can’t fix the boiler pump. I paid £75 call out fee and another £220.

12/10/2024,01/10/2024,247 Home Scam should be the real name…,"247 Home Scam should be the real name of the company. So this is how it works:1. You call boiler not working. Engineer (so called) turns up 5 minutes later without opening the cover tells the unspecting tenant major works needed company will be in touch.2. You get a call from the company new boiler sales team, very very concerned your boiler is beyond economic repair because thier engineer has condemmed the boiler due to extensive parts needed to be changed & the boiler being substandard and old. Its a Main(Baxi) boiler and 8 years old! so you ask how much is it well for you just around 2400 pounds.3. You refuse they cancel your cover, I asked for a copy of the engineers report which has this on it ""premier sensor resistance was very low 3.5kom, also they advised that the PCB was faulty and required replacement. ""4.Flumexed how he could have gaterd all this information without opening the panel & Baxi advised all this without any being on site I called Baxi! I am aure you can guess what they said... no call received regarding my boiler serial number and there is no way they could have diagosed this or nay one could have without being on site and no one knows what this premier sensor is on thier boiler.5. Stumped and out of options I ask them how much will they charge for a repair £443.00 is the figure that came back with! fair does to them the lady said you could pay this over 12 months and the boiler will be covered for the 12 months too, they wanted the last engineers report so they could make sure they had the parts on the van, so that is when I had called you the customer services and they said we can also het the manufacturer out for  a repair at he cost of some 265 pounds, never offered this before! only a boiler replacement! 6. Had already paid the Baxi guys and they had confirmed they will turn up the next day so kept them on. They did turn up the next day first thing in the morning and lo and behold there was nothing wrong with the boiler except the timer on the boiler was off no PCB no fictitious  premier sensor.... nothing at all. 7. Fuming that I had been had and almost fell prey to 24/7 high pressure sales tactics I wrote an email to their complaint team wanting to know how does a boiler with a timer switched off get diagnosed as beyond economic repair... and my policy terminated because I didn't accept their new boiler.. Their complaints department wouldn't take any names  on a public forum came back with a 20 pound compensation as a good will gesture and I am £443 down. Needless to state I will be filing a complaint with the financial ombudsman today. 8. They had done the same thing on another property of mine a week before as they filed its CP12 on routine seals which British Gas & Main both have confirmed are service items and must be changed on service inspection, lo and behold I get a call from their new boiler team stating your perfectly operational Valliant Boiler needs replacing as its too old and seals are failing!!!!! What worries me  how many people has fallen victim to these scamsters.... any one who has please speak out, so others especially the old  don't fall victim to the unscrupulous methods of this company.

They wanted me to pay £90 (even though we pay the monthly cost) and then told us someone would come out two days later. Asked to speak to a manager but apparently they were all at home. Later found out there was a manager on shift.Had to find someone locally who came out and fixed the problem quickly. I have sent 247 home rescue the invoice and will not be continuing the contract. Update: their reply about not being able to find my details is nonsense. I rang them there times today! Update: they've updated their response now but this has still been an appalling experience. I can't wait to leave contract and find a company that actually cares.

12/10/2024,01/10/2024,Unreliable,"We've been with 247 Home Rescue for two or three years.  Our policy includes an annual boiler service.  Previously there's been no problem, but this year . . . .I received a reminder that a service was due and went online to book it.  It said all appointments for this month were booked . . . and next month . . . and the month after.  I went a year forward in their calendar and it was still showing no appointments available.  So my husband rang up - because we thought there must be a fault on the website - and he was told that, yes, all appointments were booked for the next year.  Not much point in having a policy that includes a service if there's no one to carry it out.  The person on the helpdesk said they would 'phone us when an appointment became available.  After two weeks and no 'phone call, my husband 'phoned again and was told ""We can send someone today.""  Yes please!  Several hours later they rang to say ""The engineer can't do today but he can come some time tomorrow.""  We had made plans for the day but, since it's important to get the boiler serviced before the cold weather sets in, we stayed in all day, waiting for the engineer - who didn't come.  My husband tried ringing the company but, clearly, there's no one on the boiler service helpdesk at the weekend, because when he pressed the button suggested he just got a recorded message saying the engineer would ring half and hour before he arrived.  Neither of which things happened.We will ring again on Monday but I'm not holding out much hope.  And when our policy is up for renewal we shall be looking elsewhere for cover."
13/10/2024,01/10/2024,Helpful & efficient service,The engineer immediately identified the cause of my heating/hot water problem and installed the required replacement valve and tested everything. All done in under an hour and I'm very satisfied with the 247 service.
13/10/2024,01/10/2024,Incompetent engineers,Had boilers serviced at my rental properties the engineer did not clean out the boiler filter which I find quite amazing as the policy does not cover sludge entering the boiler surely this is part of a service I have only checked one I will now have to go and check the restWaste of time having service if they only do half a job

I was told no appointments until December. When I complained I was told someone would be here last Monday 7th Oct . Waited in all day nobody arrived. Rescheduled for today. Still no verification that they are coming. Nobody answering phone. And when they do will I be told another pack of lies.

I then had to suffer 20 mins of the same speech about how I would lose cover if I took the new quote. The salesman wouldn't stop talking and I eventually had to raise my voice in order for him to shut up. After this fiasco I decided that I'd go somewhere else, if the salesman had just accepted my initial call to cancel I would still be using 24/7 as my breakdown company.Also, when I got my boiler service earlier this year I'm sure the engineer didn't do a thorough job as he was in and out in 10 mins, he also took my pension."

Despite initially signing up to a contract that was very competitive, the service thus far has been far from satisfactory. Despite joining in December of last year, the first date available for the mandatory service was August of this year. This was then cancelled by the company due to “unforeseen circumstances” with 48h notice, with the first available rescheduled date being October. Today, after staying in all day and receiving a text that an engineer would arrive between 1pm and 6pm, we received a text saying that due to “unforeseen circumstances” the engineer could no longer attend🤬 If we were to cancel an appointment we could be hit with a £35 penalty. I doubt we will receive the same in return for their incompetence. Very poor service indeed. Our years contract will be up before we eventually get an engineer!"

16/10/2024,01/10/2024,Pathetic,"I took out the policy at £20.24/mo for boiler, central heating etc and at the time it was great value for money. Then the policy automatically got renewed for the next year at £34.24/mo. I only realised 3 months later when central heating stopped working and I tried to make a claim only to find out they don’t cover my boiler. They weren’t ready to make any goodwill gestures to retrospectively reduce the policy premium (even for a few months). I told them to cancel the policy with immediate effect and was told by the agent over the phone that no further payments will be taken but I still received an email from a “no reply” account that one more payment will be deducted from my account. Ridiculous!"
16/10/2024,01/10/2024,Avoid this lot.,"This company serviced my boiler and told me it was to be condemned, but they could sort me out a lovely new one for £58 a month for the next 10 years, around 7 grand.

They installed a new boiler for me in July when the Engineer was leaving he handed me the thermostat controls and said he'd never used that model before and for me to log onto Youtube which I've done but it's difficult to follow. I'm 79.  Rang 24/7 to book a follow up service and for them to show me how to set the controls. Booked service on line for yesterday and got the confirmation email. Engineer didn't turn up. Rang them they said the booking hadn't gone through properly even though I'd got the confirmation email. Told me to book another service which wouldn't be until December! Wasn't happy with that but tried to book another service then but have been told ""the relevant department will ring me so can't book another one"" Going round in circles. Think I'm going to cancel the service contract. Had another call from 24/7 which I missed I rang them back and they asked me why I was ringing and  started to log a new claim and were going to charge me £75 excess fee!!!!!     They don't know what they're doing!! .   I'm going to cancel the policy."

Premium was very cheap but I'm now giving up on it.Ihave a flat where the pipes are behind walls or under floors.I had a leak in the bathroom which was showing up on the floor. To get to the leak the plumber would have needed to access the pipe through the wall. This is turned out was not covered in the policy. The leak must be visible for it to be repaired. The relevent clause says no investigation or access is inlucded. As far as I am concerend this makes the claim to cover plumbing worthless as in most cases the source of the leak is not visible as most pipes are behind walls (unless your home is the Pompidou Centre). Most plumbers do know how to access pipes behind walls in my experience.

21/10/2024,01/10/2024,SCAM SCAM please Don't waste your time and Money with this company not worth it.,"IT'S A SCAM, can't believe they are allowed to operate as an emergency service, I have their HOME CARE PLUS policy which is their premium policy and guess what, they provide heating and boiler breakdown and the rest,  I have contacted them regarding an issue I have with my radiators not getting warm , so the engineer came out and checked everything and told me he will be back and someone will contact regarding an appointment,  sure enough they did call me and asked me to pay £146 for the repair,  I believed that I had INSURANCE against this kind of cost,  they said we will cover the parts and labour but we can't drain the system,  now if anyone knows little bit about heating system that if you want to carry out any job regarding radiators or boiler you need to take water out which is draining the system that is basic,  guess what that part which is draining the system to carry out any jobs is NOT COVERED,  and they gave me the price of £146 odd to open one small bolt to let the water out it's a pure SCAM,  SAVE your self hassle and time,  do not go near them , they PRICE looks very attractive but you won't get anything in return,  DON'T waste your MONEY IT'S A SCAM. "
21/10/2024,01/10/2024,This scam& dodgy company has broken my…,"This scam& dodgy company has broken my healthy boiler and has very very poor serviceAvoid this dodgy company.Read my review carefully& I tell you how they play dirty&break your healthy boiler to be able to sell you a new boiler& steal your money.You pay them around £200-250 annually for their landlord care plan.Then you call them multiple times to arrange for a boiler annual service&landlord gas safety certificate.My tenants didn't have any issues with the boiler at all before the engineer's visit&it was working perfectly.The tenant took a day off work&stayed home between 8am-6pm.Their staff who are based in India and Pakistan call you 2-3 times on the same day before the engineer's visit&push you to sell you a new boiler&if you decline it then they try to sell you their company products like descaler, inhibitors etc.When you decline their products again then engineer won't turn up for the appointment on the day&waste your time&money.Then you arrange another appointment&engineer attend the 2nd appointment after weeks if you are lucky then he told us the boiler is faulty &needs to be repaired but he tells you "" IT IS NOT COVERED BY YOUR POLICY"" & you have to pay extra in spite of having no issues with the boiler at all! I made a huge mistake& trusted them and I paid £210&the engineer falsely claims he fixed the boiler but no Landlord Safety Certificate or no other repair report was given to me by the engineer or by 24/7.Then, my tenants experienced issues with the hot water the day after the repair.Then hot water stopped completely a week after repair!!! I complained to them straight away then they ask me to pay £95 to book an engineer appointment to fix their fault. They are an absolute joke and very dodgy. My tenants took a day off again&stayed home again 8am-6pm but engineer didn't turn up again for 2nd time in 2 wks.My tenants&I are very disappointed&very frustrated with this fake and scam company. My tenants took 2 days off work but the engineers didn't show up twice and wasted my tenants time and money. I complained to them&cancelled my all policies immediately&they offered me only £25 which is an absolute joke!While they took around £500 from me&created a fake job&didn't do anything and broke my healthy boiler.I have spoken to different staffs multiple times who are based mainly in India&Pakistan&Eastern Europe& requested full refund of £210 as there was no issues with boiler before the engineer's visit.The engineer are unprofessional, incompetent& useless &they took advantage of our trust&made up a fake job&damaged the healthy boiler. My tenants lost money and time because they stayed home twice but the engineer didn't turn up twice.It's very unprofessional company with very poor service which only takes money every month but when you desperately need them, they don't care about you at all. Don't get fooled with their reviews, I don't believe it at all. If customers miss the appointment then customers have to pay £30 penalty each time, however the engineer failed to attend twice while my tenants stayed home the whole day and they didn't offer us any money. Their customer service is absolutely rubbish and you have to call them many times and chase them and they keep you waiting for over 15 min with no luck to solve your problem. Now, I have called 2 different boiler engineers from different companies and they checked the boiler and they informed me the previous engineer has broken the boiler and it cost around £1000 to fix it or better to buy a new boiler. The tenant didn't have any issues at all with the boiler before the visit by 24/7 engineer and he deliberately has broken the healthy boiler and I am absolutely disgusted. So, please be aware of this scam company with incompetent and fake engineers. I cancelled my other policies with them and I advise you to cancel your policies straight away and save you time and money. But if you decide to keep the policy, make sure, you stand next to the engineer when he visit your boiler. And if he tells you the boiler is faulty or at risk etc, don't believe him and don't trust him at all and get a second opinion from a different engineer from a different company. Because 24/7 is a SCAM and dodgy company!"

I was with another Boiler manintenance company in the past and was unimpressed when they finished the job in less than 5 minutes.

Then on a call today I was asked about a carbon monoxide alarm, told them mine is faulty and has been removed and they said they will tell the engineer to bring it without telling me a price or asking if I wanted them to do it.

Professional, polite and offered helpful advice.However 24/7's policy of not giving a time slot, other than 8am to 6pm, is not helpful at all. The price has also increased considerably in the last couple of years. They also call you to sell you overpriced extras. Plus, if there's a fault on your boiler, you're probably not covered. My father's boiler had a fault on it and 24/7 wouldn't repair it. They stuck a sticker on the boiler and said he was not advised to use it as it was dangerous but, as it was still working, it wasn't broken and so they didn't have to fix it! They wanted £170 for parts and labour fir a cheap part £15 or so and a 15 minute job. I will shop around next year. "

But fear not, for our salvation arrived in the form of an intrepid engineer, a paragon of expertise and resolve. From the moment he crossed the threshold, his demeanor was one of calm assurance and unwavering focus. With tools in hand and knowledge abundant, he embarked on his noble mission to restore warmth to the hearth. Methodical and precise, he inspected and toiled, undeterred by the complexities that lay before him.His work was not merely a repair but an exhibition of mastery. Each turn of the wrench, each measured adjustment, was executed with a grace that bespoke years of experience. Patiently, he explained the process, ensuring that we, the grateful recipients of his toil, understood the care being taken.In less time than it takes to recount, the boiler roared back to life, an anthem of victory over cold and discomfort. We stand warmed not only by the heat of our radiator but by the knowledge that such stewards of craft exist. For those in need of a guiding hand through the battlefield of broken boilers, our engineer stands ready—undaunted and ever steadfast. Truly, this was a service rendered with fortitude worthy of high praise."

They contact you when a gas service engineer is in the area, so no 'jumping through hoops' etc as you would have to with some of the major companies when you want them to provide what you pay for. So far, this has meant that my boiler has been serviced at more frequent than every 12 months, which is a positive and a bonus indeed. Thomas, the service appliance engineer who attended, lives locally and is very friendly and gave positive reassurances about the condition of my boiler, instilling me with confidence about it's reliability over the coming winter months. Their monthly charges are also only about half of what I would pay with the likes of British Gas. Well worth it when you consider that prior to taking out cover I had to pay £400 for a emergency plumber to attend for a failed boiler about two years ago during winter.  "

On stating that I wasn't in and could I reschedule I was told yes and then they put the phone down 😂.Received an email stating that my cover was increasing from £13.99 to £22.99. Website is useless and to cancel you need to speak to I think an Indian call centre which is haphazard too say the least. On calling them to cancel I was put on hold then miraculously informed they could now do it for £15.99. Advised I wasn't interested. Then told I had one payment left scheduled for 15th October. I clarified that as this was the 20th it had been paid. Then received an email stating last payment 02 Nov, which is actually the end date of the policy. Next day received a voicemail and email stating they could now do it for £14.99!!! Emailed back that I did not wish to proceed nor do i wish to be contacted anymore. Today I have received yet another voicemail from India. DO NOT TOUCH THIS LOT!!!! "

On the second occasion I had to phone 24/7 in the late afternoon to be told they’re not coming. I had gone to the trouble of clearing the utility room out on both occasions so the engineer had plenty of room. This was a waste of time for me on both occasions.If I am not there for the appointment it costs me £30 each time, however when 24/7 don’t turn up will I get compensation? I doubt it. My time is valuable too. So good engineer when they turn up terrible at fulfilling appointments"

26/10/2024,01/10/2024,Appalling service for vulnerable customer,My mother is 81 and very vulnerable - she pays a monthly subscription to 247 in case of issues with her heating/ hot water/ boiler - not the cheapest but they imply they cover all week round. Well not if you're in an area that they don't cover and they sub contract to... they don't do weekends. Appalling. Also they don't tell you this when you take the cover out. And you have to pay the up front £45 callout charge before they then tell you noone available until Monday .... and they still don't confirm a callout! We made a claim at 8.30am on a Saturday morning. After paying the £45 excess they offer Monday. I ask for a refund .. then I'm told they will try their hardest to get a callout before then (elderly lady living on her own with no hot water nor heating) ... so I think ok I'll give them a chance. Then called back late on sat afternoon saying nothing till Monday. Unhelpful customer service from an Indian call centre. They like to take your money then not deliver a service. Would not recommend.

30/10/2024,01/10/2024,Disgraceful company,"I was with 247 home rescue for the last 4 years, I recently had an issue with my boiler (no hot water, no heating) I contacted 247 home rescue regarding this, after completing several checks I was told I needed to pay £95 excess for a claim, I paid this, they then told me it would be 5 days before an engineer could arrive, this is how they treat emergencies 😳I get a call from the engineer and he tries to help me through a video call to get the boiler working, he can't believe that 247 home rescue are leaving me with no heating or hot water for 5 days (I have a young family)The boiler did not respond to any attempts to get it working, over the phone the plumber tells me the boiler fan is needing replaced, he will let 247 know this.The next I know, 247 call me and tell me that my boiler is BER (beyond economical repair) I have either to pay for full repair or pay for replacement boiler... I'm like ""what on earth am I paying insurance for? 😳They then send quotes for replacing boiler for £3000. The next email I get from 247 home rescue is them informing me they have cancelled my insurance policy with them, stating that the boiler is too old and BER (they knew the age of it yet happily took the monthly premium prior to this for years) as they had cancelled the insurance policy, I contacted my bank and cancelled the direct debit, that was on the 28/10/24Two days later, I receive an email and text message from them regarding me cancelling the direct debit, the message states ""to avoid cancellation fee being charged, we have reinstated your direct debit and policy"" WTF! Seems a nice earner, take the monthly payments for insurance, when policy holder puts in a claim 247 home rescue just pull the rug and don't pay out, they knew the age of the boiler but at no time was any advice given, so as well as the monthly premiums + the £95 excess I paid to be told, ""I'm no longer insured"" I paid £260 out of my own pocket to get boiler repaired and was told by the engineer that my boiler could work away for years to come.Do not use this company! 😡"

Whats the point of having the cover if you’re going to charge more? GOD KNOWS HOW MANY MORE HIDDEN CHARGES THERE ARE! The customer representative did not disclose this at the time of making the claim or even mentioned there COULD be an additional cost. All in all, its cheaper to actually source local.

Plus they charge £70 excess for any call outs linked to the boiler including pipes and the rads as the boiler is 15 years old. What’s the point in having cover! They are ripping off old people, and then make it difficult to cancel cover."

What I received was an immediate response to thank me for renewing my policy, with no further details.Had I, as a 77 years old Military Veteran, not been a little more alert, my Direct Debit would have been increased, without me realising it, while not receiving the Customer Service standards that I believed I would receive.

My wife and I are both in their 70s, with a severely bed-bound disabled daughter, whom we care for.  For our peace of mind, we took out a Home Rescue Plus 247 plan to receive the highest level of cover for our Worcester Bosch – Greenstar – 440CDi Boiler and any Plumbing issues. I am a new customer of Home Rescue 247 I had to call an engineer out to deal with our central heating system and a water leak on the central heating pipe. The engineer arrived late on Friday afternoon on the 1st Nov. He stated that we don’t cover Worcester Bosch – Greenstar – 440CDi Boiler and as such I can’t touch the system. Furthermore, I cannot repair the water leak as it would involve him opening up floorboards on the landing and he is not allowed to do this. I said I find this strange as where would one expect the pipework to be located in the house other than some running beneath the floorboards? He said to take it up with the company. It came across to me that the engineer did not want to do the work as it was late Friday afternoon. I became frustrated and extremely disappointed but did not wish to argue with him. He has left us in the lurch without any consideration for our predicament. I have found Home Rescue to be dishonest in offering the cover they promised, and as such I strongly advise and recommend that people look for an alternative trustworthy supplier.  I am an extremely disheartened customer. Nobody from Home Rescue 247 has got back to me to discuss the matter.I hope to receive an appropriate compensation.Thank you.M I Essa (Retired Magistrate)Bolton"

02/11/2024,01/11/2024,Avoid this company at all costs!,"This company uses very dubious hard sell techniques. When their engineer arrived to do my annual service he immediately told me I needed a new boiler and showed me a few small nodules on the heat exchanger saying that’s about to go and you need a new boiler. This set alarm bells going so I took pictures and sent them to gas fitter friend. His assessment was that there was no imminent danger of the boiler breaking down. But if there was a problem with the heat exchanger Worcester Bosh would replace it if the boiler was under ten years old and charge only for labour. If 247 were reputable they should have known this and advised me accordingly. Within half an hour of the engineer leaving I received a call from the 247 salesman offering to quote me for a new boiler which I declined.Because the 247 engineer had worried me I contacted the manufacturer Worcester Bosh who sent their own engineer a few days later.On taking the cover off the boiler the Worcester Bosh engineer described what I had been told by the 247 engineer as “Nonsense”He declined to change the heat exchanger as it didn’t need replacing. He carried out a full service and pointed out several parts of the service which had not been done by  247. When I mentioned this to 247 they replied that they only do a visual check. Does this actually constitute a service??So cutting the story short , 247 said they had acted correctly and  it was my decision to accept their advice or not.  I believe it was just a blatant attempt to sell me a boiler I didn’t need. I ended up reluctantly paying a fee to cancel my contract because I certainly didn’t want 247 back at my house again!"

Hence I have been calling them from overseas multiple times, requesting the inhibitor to be installed. This has been promised to me on multiple occasions, however after more than 3 moth, still nothing done and not even a call received.So it just makes sense to request a cancellation, however they also want a cancellation fee.Regards, TinIm looking forward to your reply , from pass experience  i wouldnt get any more update."

The so called engineer came next day Friday, spent 15min blowing down pipes and 10 typing on his tablet, cleaned an electrode and said it was fixed. (25min total). Broke down the next day same fault. I called 24/7 again, didnt get back to me all weekend, left me freezing no heating or hot water. They said the PCB was faulty and wrote it off, would cost £750 and I had to pay to get it fixed. I got an independent CH engineer who did a full diagnostic check and fixed it for £75. You have been warned! I'm in dispute with them for breach of contract. They phoned me this morning 4/11/24, so they do have my details. This is a stock deniability reply to all complaints."

But the engineer did not come and did not contact me for the reasons of not showing. I have waited for 2 full days to get the engineer visit and wasted my time. One of the sale team was also keep calling me to sell the CO2 detector, I have also paid for CO2 detector which she said that the engineer will bring it on the day of boiler service.

I questioned if this was genuine and was told it was, obviously a scammed would say that,but I was also checking information from the site and the fact that the location of the number which rang me was same as registered office and an email I received convinced me to carry on.The advisor was really nice and totally understanding to my issues. The fact this is being done by DD gives me the chance to cancel should anything look dodgy.Overall they give good service and price and also having used this company before helped. Just wish they just let you continue with your application without instantly calling you as it does give you doubts even though they were giving me a better price from the good price already I would have preferred to complete things myself.

However he put the pressure up and just gave some advice. My only negative feedback would be I paid £95 for someone to come out but I still don’t know what’s wrong with the boiler so that’s money down the drain and I’m still back where I started.

I signed up with them over a  year ago- my so-called cover included a boiler servivce . Engineer came, did nothing, & left saying boiler controls looked ok. I have  had oroper boiler service- engineer always checks oresdure at top of boiler- pumps it up with a bicycke type pump & measures, then ckeans the brushes then does  several physical checks including gas emissions- , all integral part of any service.Not 24/7 engineer- did nothing. Did not even take the front off the boiler to see inside. I called this compsny- who passed me from ine department to snother- all of who only wanted  to convince me to extend my policy. It was a big fight to disconnect from them. Eventually- it took a stressfull 1/2 hour insisting I want to leave them  - just to stop them sucking my money every  month - - for nothing. I was happily boiker insured by Homecare for years- great service & helpfull office staff- never any problems & certainly no stress - unlike this 24/7 outfit. I have learned my lesson- dont change companies if the one youve been with was good. -& warn as many people as possible about the waste of money nightmare called 24/7 home care. All they care about is getting your money every month. Hortible company with rude hassling workers--horrid exoerience!!    BEWARE to AVOID !!!

Over two month lead and first one was cancelled adding another month ( total 3 month wait for gas service to take place). Seems they operate under staffed.

After several emails I was asked to provide a report! Eventually, several months later, I was told the expansion vessel and pressure release valve needed replacing. I was quoted over £300 for the repair and another quote for a new boiler. After being  quoted for the repair I received a telephone call today to say the the ‘boiler was deemed to be beyond repair’ and my cover had been cancelled.

07/11/2024,01/11/2024,Poor customer service,"I had two heating cover policies with this company. I had to cancel one due to selling the property, and as I had not had a claim or a service carried out I expected no fee upon cancellation as per the T&Cs. However I was told there would be a £30 admin fee. I contested this and was sent a different version of their T&Cs as evidence. Given that these were never shown to me before, and I was never advised of a change to the T&Cs they were not valid, and I was able to get the fee waived in this instance.The second policy I did have a service carried out. The engineer was good, arrived promptly and carried out the service. However I was never sent the certificate. Furthermore they called on the morning of the appointment to upsell an inhibitor topup. I understand that's a regular maintenance job to do, and the price offered was reasonable - however by calling so soon before the appointment they create a sense of urgency and may panic people into just agreeing on the spot. It should be advised and offered well in advance of the appointment in my opinion. An inhibitor topup was not required in this case, however I had to contact them twice after the appointment to get the refund issued."

It was just after 8.30am. If your not a morning person then DONT do any jobs in the morning. He was rude and frankley no help at all. I then rang the desk today advising as my policy includes drainage the engineer should have cleaned it out. Instead the engineer quoted, he isnt going to clean out other people dirt out of the pipes. I need to request for someone to do it. VERY DISAPPOINTED and disgusted with the lack of professionalism. The team on the phone were also no help and said I have to get someone independently to do it. Why am I paying monthly when these people reject to help EVERYTIME I request for a issue to be resolved. This is the first time I have rang them for help and appalled with the negative response. Very bad experience."

I noticed my flues were fitted horizontally, and the engineer behaved non-professionally. I discussed this matter with an alternative gas engineer and mentioned it is safe and legally acceptable as the flue is clamped and has a specific distance from the walls. I'm sure 24*7 want to make unnecessary money from the customers.With an alternative incident, an electrical engineer from 24*7 visited my property and terminated my bedroom power supply to avoid central power drifting. I resolved it with a local electrician, who noted that the wire terminated by 24*7 was not placed safely and, luckily, did not cause a fire. Also, please read the terms & conditions carefully - They won't cover full electrical works & boiler repairs.Overall, they are the UK's top cheating company. "

08/11/2024,01/11/2024,The most honest review I can write;,"The most honest review I can write;247 arranged for an engineer to service the boiler and I was at work, so left a key for the service to take place.When I returned and tried to shower my boiler was faulting.I contacted their emergency helpline and a different engineer was sent to my house. The engineer came and genuinely seemed to have zero clue about boilers. I was absolutely sure that the fault must have occurred when the service took place, but the engineer (by the use of Google) decided the fault was due to the main circuit board and left, leaving me with no heating or hot water.I was then contacted by their call centre to inform me that ‘my boiler was uneconomical to repair, but they’d offer me £200 off a boiler replacement’I asked to escalate the issue as I had a fully operational boiler before their engineer came and I had a boiler that had been deemed unrepairable’I was called by a ‘supervisor’ who was from an off shore call centre and genuinely seemed completely disinterested in the fact that 247 had broken my boiler.I was advised by 247 that if I wasn’t happy with their response I should organise my own plumber, which I did.Long story short, the 247 engineer had increased the pressure too high. The local plumber came, reduced the pressure and it cost me £20.How on earth this company can treat people like this is beyond me. To break my boiler and the condemn it to get me to buy a new boiler should be criminal.Interesting that when you call their new customer department you get their UK based call centre. When you’re trying to discuss a complaint they’re happy for you to discuss with someone who’s second language is English and has absolutely no influence or interest in customer service or satisfaction.I can’t be the only person who’s had this? No idea which algorithm is pumping their ratings. Absolutely disgraceful "

No evidence is provided to say the work is complete, despite umpteen phone calls, usually 30min+, being pushed from department to department.I strongly advise to stay very, very far away.13.11 update - 247 immediately replied to this TrustPilot review saying that they would be in touch - but they haven’t done so. Today I called them myself.  They still refuse to issue evidence of work completed, that I have paid for.  I’m told that I need to book another Gas Safety Check appointment.

11/11/2024,01/11/2024,You pay £95 call-out charge after the monthly payments ,"They have collected my money for over one year without a call for their help.  When they sent someone for an annual maintenance, the person just came to check and see if everything is working as the boiler is only 3 yrs old, and he spent 3 minutes and left.The first time I called for assistance, they wanted me to pay them £95 when they didn’t even know what is wrong with it. That is absolute nonsense because if there was an excess to pay, it has to be when they have to buy parts because I have been paying them every month, and when they renewed this month without my consent, it’s gone up from £14 to 18 a month, so why should I pay £95 as if I’m calling some random person to come to my home???. I know I should have read this but I didn’t because I took the  policy on the phone and the person took over 40 minutes to explain BUT NEVER MENTIONED ANY EXCESS OF £95. He only told me the good side; up to £1000 on parts when I call for assistance. That is when someone should pay an excess towards the parts. If they don’t need to buy parts but just restarting, or something that I can’t do, WHY SHOULD I PAY AN EXCESS AS IF THEY DONT COLLECT MONEY EVERY MONTH FROM ME? I have cancelled the direct debit and when they called me, I have asked them to cancel it. I got a cheaper one from my bank, which customers pay the rest of the money when the parts they have to order is more than £300 because of the monthly payments of £18.99, and that includes mobile phones repairs, car roadside assistance and travel insurance.  As if they own my bank account, they have sent me an email this morning that they will reinstate my direct debit otherwise they will charge me a cancellation fee, but they renewed the policy without informing me only this month, and I will go to the financial ombudsman if they try to frustrate me after collecting my money for over a year without doing anything for me.I called a random person who charged me £75 and brought the pressure up, and even taught me how to do it by myself next time. This is what they wanted me to pay £95 although they didn’t know what was wrong with the boiler.The sensible thing 24/7 could do is to charge that £95 when they have to order parts because it could be a low pressure, which I couldn’t bring it up,  or something that doesn’t need parts. I would not recommend using their services. "

The call centre didn’t understand my issue and sent out a plumber (who which I may add was great and very apologetic when he arrived and discovered he couldn’t do a job). I’ve tried calling to get an issue resolved and still no further forward. This is all after they have doubled my renewal policy after the first year. I’ve looked at my claims on the app (which is terrible) and they have marked all my claims as completed even though nothing has been done. *Update MS626364Update 14/11/24To no surprise I’ve still had zero contact from this company about my issue, this is after speaking to the head engineer on the phone and emailing videos with my issue which has been ignored even after emailing to ensure he had received the emails.

The best part is that there is no 30 day exclusion period, with this particular policy, which is brilliant. The engineer who attended, was super friendly and manged to temporarily get me back up and running and requested authorisation for replacement parts, which was granted the following day. I couldn't be happier. They deserve 10 stars. If you're stuck or just want peace of mind, I would highly recommend 247 Home Rescue! "

11/11/2024,01/11/2024,Dreadful service. No heating or hot water for 5 days. Still not fixed.,"I have had no heating or hot water for a week. I raised a claim with 247 and booked an engineer visit the next day detailing the issue. The engineer called beforehand and tried to cancel, then he came and said he didnt have the right qualifications but said we needed a new part. The next day 247 called and asked for £100 to drain the system and would send someone out in 2 days when the qualified engineer was back from holiday. Today they have called saying the qualified engineer isn't available?!! We are cold and frustrated. 247 this is not a good example of customer service and needs fixing urgently. I would not recommend this company. "

The reason for the prompt call becomes apparant - they stated the Boiler was beyond economical repair. Because my Boiler was 9 Years old they added depreciation so valued it at £350, the cost of the repair was £390.  I asked if I could pay the extra £40, they refused.  They then offered me a new Boiler at £2900 but they would contribute £400 - I declined and asked for the £400 or at least the write off value (£350) they declined.This is all in your Terms and Conditions, I should have read them, granted, but surely when I took out the Policy this should have been highlighted as you won't get many repairs for under £400 in the current climate.Never again - awful Company, use D&G or Homeserve - they are Fantastic!"

I was just lucky I had someone waiting in for them. On the day, I had a call from the office (I answered as assumed it was the 30min warning call….). It was actually a sales call, asking me to pay for an additional service. I explained I was at work and couldn’t discuss it then… neither did I want to just yes without any knowledge of what is was for. The salesperson continued…. I felt very cornered and uneasy. Not a good experience."

After contacting them to cancel my entire plan they were throwing all sorts of charges at me 1. To cancel my plan £30 2. They wanted a month's money for a service plan which was nonsense, they offered to reduce my monthly payments and for go the £79 excess, the part that was required didn't cost that much, they eventually cancelled making sure I was aware I had to pay a month's plan and £30.  Everything sounds good on paper but they have so many hidden costs it's unreal be very careful with them.."

I had unfortunate dealings with them on multiple occasions and my summary of the company is- BARELY ANYTHING is covered in the terms. Like for plumbing, draining the system is not covered. Most central heating jobs require a draining system which means we have to pay £135, for toilets replacing some part would mean moving the toilet for which they charge £145 (and no they won't agree to us using the builders to move the toilet)- They use engineers who don't know much about what they are doing. Multiple occasions their engineers conflicted the previous one.- Customer service doesn't follow instructions- to resolve something would require many many calls as teams don't talk and engineer don't follow up.- engineers due to lack of knowledge will make things worse and then blame it on you.- engineers will find a way to make sure it's not covered. They fixed one thing but messed another and blame my system.- engineer would blame previous engineer from the same company for wrong quote and for ordering wrong partsMy boiler had a pressure issue which meant changing expansion vessel. I got that changed by paying for draining which wasn't covered. The engineer did something that my boiler keeps cutting off. Another different engineer came and said that I need a complete boiler strip off which is ridiculous as everything was fine before the engineer did the works.Overall disappointed with them and will not renew my contract.AVOID"

We had a boiler serviced done, but after the visit, we miraculously got a leak in our pipes; can't blame him, but it's a weird coincidence.I asked for another technician to come out the next morning, but it was the evening after (on Friday) only 20 mins before his finish time. He found the leak but said he needed access, so couldn't do the job.We waited until Monday for a joiner to create access, I took photos, sent them via email as instructed and was told it would be 24 hours for them to review, which is ridiculous in itself. It should be close to immediate, for a ""24/7 company""My parents are elderly, have Parkinson's and recovering from cancer. It's been 4 days of waiting, it's just snowed, and still no one is coming out. I rang up, and the technical team said it would take up until this afternoon. I'm going to ring later this morning, as I was originally told 24 hours, but it's already been 25.There is nothing 24/7 about this business.Staff themselves are ok to talk to on the phone. This complaint is about the business itself.I'm now looking around for a better place for my parents and am urging everyone I know to not go with this sham of a company.I shall edit this if we get immediate help from them."

20/11/2024,01/11/2024,Absolutely terrible service,"Absolutely terrible service. I have held a policy since 2023 on a new boiler. A condition of the boilers warranty is that it is serviced annually, to this end I had the boiler serviced by 24/7 on 09/02/2023. In turn the next annual service needed to be completed February 2024, however every time I made an attempt to book a service via the app I received a message to tell me that 'Your service is due February 2025, we will contact you nearer the time'. Clearly this was an erroneous message as this would mean that my boiler had not been serviced in February 2024, a service for which I have paid as part of my 24/7 policy. Despite repeated phone calls to 24/7 to enquire as to why my boiler was not services in February 2024 my boiler has still not been serviced. I have again chased 24/7 today, and have been told that the earliest that they are able to service my boiler is 23/01/2025. In essence this will be a 2 year interval between boiler service, which in turn will invalidate the warranty on my new boiler. To say I am annoyed would be an understatement. I have been charged for a service which hasn't been provided, and due to the lack of service by 24/7 the warranty on my new boiler has been invalidated. I will be contacting the Financial Ombudsman Service to raise a complaint, this is not the way to run a business, absolute shambles!"

21/11/2024,01/11/2024,Service is beyond disgusting,"As you can see, I initially gave this company a five-star review, as many customers likely do. They are very clever at promising everything a customer wants to hear during the first contact, particularly in an emergency. This makes it easy for people to leave positive reviews right after their initial experience. However, they never ask for feedback on the actual repair work or its outcome, which is where the real problems arise.I recently had two claims—one for a boiler issue and one for a plumbing problem—and the experience has been shocking.Boiler Claim:When the engineer visited, they claimed that my recently installed boiler was eight years old (it is only four years old) and marked it as “at risk.” This designation meant that any repairs would be entirely my responsibility, and the company refused to do anything under the policy. Furthermore, they demanded a full strip service, which I would also have to pay for. Essentially, they offered no service or support but still labeled the boiler as “at risk.”What’s worse is that the boiler was still under warranty, yet the engineer made no effort to check. Instead, they simply declared it “at risk” to push me into paying £2,800 for a replacement boiler. It was clear the engineer’s main goal was to exploit any opportunity to force me to pay thousands of pounds for the company’s profit. The complaints department later justified this by saying the engineer had done nothing wrong, claiming that treating a lie about four-year-old boiler as eight years old was “acceptable.” This reasoning is not only misleading but also insulting.Plumbing Claim:The plumbing issue was handled no better. They sent a plumber who plunged the toilet without resolving the blockage. When I reported that the issue seemed to be more serious and likely required further investigation, I was told their plumbing service only covers basic plunging and does not include any investigation or deeper repairs. As a result, the toilet remained blocked, and they refused to send anyone back.Conclusion:Labeling equipment “at risk” is just a tactic to shift all costs onto the customer while the company takes no responsibility. The boiler replacement and full strip service which not being covered are purely profit-driven schemes, and the engineers seem focused only on finding ways to pressure customers into expensive payments. The fact that they make no effort to honor service or resolve genuine issues is beyond disgusting.I want to warn others to be cautious about trusting this company, as they only interested in making money rather than honour the serviceHere’s the revised version:Subject: Follow-Up on ComplaintI’m following up regarding the company’s delayed response. They finally called me back today, three days later than they were supposed to, the manager claiming the delay was because “my number on their system was incorrect.” This is clearly a lie—if the number was wrong, how were they able to call me now? Such an excuse is both insulting and unprofessional.What’s even worse is that, despite the delay, they stated they wouldn’t be able to do anything to resolve the issue anyway. According to their complaints department who contacted me again to claim again that  the engineer falsely claiming that my four-year-old boiler was eight years old is somehow deemed “acceptable.” If I am dissatisfied with it, I may refer my complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.  This response is nothing short of a joke, and it’s clear they have no intention of taking accountability for their actions.I strongly recommend avoiding this company if you can. Their practices are deceptive, their service unreliable, and their excuses nothing but lies!"

The boiler break down on Monday last week, they don't have any availability till Wednesday. The Engineer H Rashid come to fix the boiler and also did the boiler service and provided the CP12 cert with no defect or advisory. The same night the boiler breakdown again and it started leaking water, called the 247 and they mentioned that they will send the engineer again but there is no sign of engineer until Friday afternoon. Upon checking which seen like may be his faulty which may have leak the boiler he started blaming the boiler installation which was done 6 years ago and boiler was working without any leak until he touched the boiler. When requesting what is the fix he just trying to defend himself blaming the installation and saying I am just a remote engineer and this will be looked by the office and may take a week where he know that it will be ice cold weather next week. there is no call or update, requested a local gas engineer to visit and check the fault and he said its a issue with condenser leak (how we dont know, why after 247 engineer visit ), as got 2 children in the property out which one child under 2 we decided to replace the boiler to avoid ice cold weather. The only thing now 247 will blame the installation as to show themselves innocent. We were covered for last 2 year, why your engineer visiting previously and issuing cert did not point it out and provided the cert with no defective or advisory even this engineer provided the cert. And this is not the first time, last year (Dec) after yearly boiler services the boiler started loosing the pressure and as tenants were on holiday they did not realise until they back and it was over 7 days and we have to pay again to get the engineer to go and look into the issue. the policy WS579912 first Claim id: 1350325 leading into Claim id 1352287       "

Request them to fix hot immersion so that I have at least some hot water but  no reply and if called , wait for a return call which never happened.    There engineers are useless and contradict each other. One did not detect gas leakage during service.

An engineer came on the 22nd who diagnosed the problem. He told me, he is going to the sales department to get the part but the office will contact me for options either to repair or get a new boiler. After an hour the office didn't not call, I called them. To my surprise, I was told my boiler is written off and that they will offer me a boiler on finance interest free because to repair the boiler will cost £486.I was paying breakdown cover for 1 year £17,99 a month and when my boiler breakdown 24/7 home rescue DID NOT FIX it.I was so disappointed with their service. I suffered with my family,with 2 grand kid for 3 days, l have to call private engineer to fix my boiler.The boiler that was written off is working perfectly.24/7 home rescue is NO good.I will never commend to anyone"

They cancelled my next one due to snow,  nobody called to reschedule so a week later i have had to call them, no appointments were available, and that someone would call me, they did but not until 2 days later to offer me a service in Feb 2025. But in the mean time my payments have increased nearly 2 fold and ive not even had a service with the company yet.  I called to speak to retentions to discuss this, guess what, noone available to speak to me, i would stay away from this company at all costs, and in my opinion ive had such a shoddy service i want to cancel my cover straight away and want a full refund for payments taken.

They changed it mid term when I had to make a claim, as my boiler was 10 years old but mid term went over 11 years old. They increased the excess even though the contract quoted a lower excess. The office in Bangladesh have no empathy with contracts and just quote their policy of age etc. They downgraded the policy because the boiler was over 11 years, so I left them, but couldn’t leave because of cancellation fees. They took a further higher payment due to a supposed error, never compensated. They just took a final lower payment and offered a service I never took, no compensation, no refund for the month I had to pay for and an excess in breach of contract. They quote their policy and their contract but your contract with them is ignored. Avoid, Avoid Avoid. They don’t refer to managers, so forget about complaining. I had further contact since my complaints and leaving and was given an apology, an explanation, which I didn’t agree with, but they offered a small goodwill gesture of a last payment refund now paid 6/12/4 so I have upgraded the stars to 3 for effort."

The contract only works if they have to replace parts, the engineers are decent enough, but the truth is, they are told to make temporary fixes, keep it going and eventually you might get the part you needed 2 years ago. Leaks return if parts are not replaced. Do not use this company. Don’t bother to complain, you won’t be listened to. Just platitudes, no care, no compensation policy for genuine grievances.

Unfortunately, I have encountered consistent issues with the quality of service, which has been far below acceptable standards.Due to this poor experience, I attempted to cancel my contract. However, I was informed that I would still need to pay for an entire month of service, despite not utilizing any of the services during this period. Additionally, I was charged an unexpected penalty fee, which I find both unreasonable and unjust.I kindly request that you review this matter and reconsider the charges applied to my account. I believe it is only fair that I am not held financially responsible for services that were neither used nor satisfactory.I look forward to your prompt response and a fair resolution to this matter.Reference :WS602340"

03/12/2024,01/12/2024,The service is shocking! And a JOKE!,"The service is shocking!I had my annual boiler service booked for 4th December 2024 this was booked and confirmed with 247 on 8th October 2024 that is 8 weeks in advance. I received a text from 247 today at 16:30 to tell me that the appointment for tomorrow has been cancelled, due to unforeseen circumstances and I must book another date. The next available date is 19/02/2025, 11 weeks later, not acceptable, what a joke! Because I had booked this boiler service well in advance I arranged to take a day of work for the day of the service. I now have wasted day tomorrow because of the late notice. Not good enough and wished I had never accepted the renewal of the policy in January. I will be sure not to accept the renewal again. I will be paying for a better service from another provider. After I complained they managed to arrange an engineer to complete my service on Wednesday 11th December, amazingly. The engineer turned up and spent less than 20 minutes completing the thorough service and add the addictive that I paid an additional £39.99 apparently. I say apparently because he left no paperwork at all to explain what he had apparently done within the 20 minute visit. It is more than Shocking service its a JOKE."
03/12/2024,01/12/2024,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!,"The engineer came out and tried to repair the heat exchanger but ended up snapping a screw on one of the electrodes which meant we needed a new one.  The Company ""247 Home Rescue"" then decided it was not cost effective to fit a new one as the bill for parts and labour would be around £600.  They calculated that my boiler was 8 years old and they would not do any repair costing more than £250! (Beware of this loophole). They terminated my contract and sent me a quote for a new boiler.I then contacted British Gas and explained the situation.  I took a Homecare agreement out with them for a similar monthly payment, they arrived the next day, fit a new heat exchanger and its been fine ever since. My problem with this Company is that their engineer snapped the screw which caused the problem and then the Company refused to repair the boiler because the work was going to cost more than £250.  My yearly premium was more than £250!   This same engineer has been coming to the property for 4 years and had been the only person to have ever worked on the boiler.  He did the annual service every year, the last one being 3 weeks before this incident."
03/12/2024,01/12/2024,Mixed,"I had boiler service and cover.Positives - boiler engineer for the service was very good and helpful.I did not have to use the 24/7 callout so I don't know if it is any good.Negatives - in order to book the service, they call you and start asking for personal details to confirm who you are. I was then offered a service at short notice. It feels exactly like the start of a scam and is very disconcerting. Why can't you book online? Why can you only choose the next day or no day at all? Also, my renewal price is almost double, which is fine, but when I wanted to cancel (ie turn off autorenew) this cannot be done online and has to be done on the phone. Why? This is unacceptable. Judging from other comments I'm sceptical as to whether the autorenewal will actually be switched off... So I will also cancel the direct debit to be on the safe side, and follow up my cancellation with an email. "

05/12/2024,01/12/2024,Difficult Service Experience,"I was with 247 Home Rescue for about 2 years. When the time came to get a boiler service booked the engineer did not show. In the first year I was able to rectify this by chasing them to get another engineer to attend. However, in the second year I couldn't book an engineer on their online booking form and when I then had to contact someone via email or phone the engineer did not show up at the property again. To be honest I couldn't be bothered to chase them again to get another engineer booked in, it is in their service agreement that they should get an engineer to provide a service for my boiler and I shouldn't have to chase them for this each year. So I decided to leave and go to a different company.Secondly, when it came to renewing my cover I decided to cancel this renewal. I received a phone call from the company, even though I had specified in my cancellation email to them I did not want them to call me, just to cancel the renewal. When I spoke to the employee on the phone they went through the usual process of trying to offer me a better deal, but after some consideration my decision didn't change. The customer service advisor then kept offering me the same prices and repeating themselves to which I said no I just want to cancel. I kept saying I do not want to renew because I want to go with someone else, you're prices don't make enough different. This went on maybe one or two more times. I then said look I just want to cancel the renewal, I then get asked 'why?' in a reasonably annoyed tone. Making it sound like my reasons were not justified or relevant. I responded to this last question by saying I don't have to give you a reason, I don't want to renew the policy please cancel it. The advisor then tried to offer me the same prices AGAIN to which I said look just cancel the policy I don't want to go through this again. Their tone changed again, like as if I had made it a personal choice on them, they then finally cancelled the renewal.I understand some people may be passionate about what they do and the company they work for, but when I've said 3 times I want to cancel, explained why then get asked why again it is just frustrating. I don't have to give a reason, if I don't want your product then I don't want it, just cancel the renewal. It made me feel as though I was going to be forced into continuing the following year. I don't love being called either just randomly by companies, I'd rather email or do this online for this exact reason, and arguing with me for why I want to leave is not going to change my mind, but confirm my opinion. In reality I should really be refunded for the lack of their boiler service as well! I do not feel that I was rude or disrespectful but I felt the advisor was to me. I probably wouldn't use them again unless their prices were significantly better than everyone else's. "

We contacted 247 for emergency assistance, only to be told they couldn’t send a plumber out for 48 hours or we could opt to be placed on a cancellation list. With no time to wait, we called our own plumber to fix the issue.To make matters worse, 247 then informed us that we were not covered because we had contacted a plumber directly, even though they were unable to provide service themselves in a timely manner. This lack of support and clarity has completely eroded our confidence in the company.We’ve since cancelled our policy, and based on this experience, I would strongly advise against using 247. The lack of service, communication, and flexibility is simply unacceptable."

Contract no  :MS478810Scaremongering saying things like your boiler wont last very long just pray carbon monoxide alarm does is not triggered. Anyways for me i never had great experience with 247 Home rescue but becuase my boiler has been fine i have been with them for the past few years. Never stopped disappointing me sending me sub contractors who do not know where the water filler pipe were. They eventually send me their company engineer. Well well opened the machine a little throughly then previous ones but then he had to find something and slapped a danger note on the boiler. Very much scaring me to consider a new boiler. Cheap and affordable if your boiler is not breaking down. Please read small prints with this company.

They take too long in between engineer visits, even through when customer is old/vulnerable and been without heating or hot water for neatly 3 weeks as at 9th Dec 2024.

09/12/2024,01/12/2024,Most unethical and unreliable,"Most unethical and unreliable service company, that I had to deal with. I think this could be marked as fraudulent and listed in FCA Warning List. Took the boiler cover last year in 2023, and was promised 1 free service and full cover for heating. When claimed for some intermittent boiler issues, they never did any repairs, however said that the boiler cannot be covered under their service agreement by their service engineer and wanted to sell a new boiler. They said, they would cover the boiler only if we did the repairs. I do not understand their cover, if I need do the repairs or buy new boiler from them? Had several complaints and later referred to the financial ombudsmen for getting our complaints looked into. It took over and year for the ombudsmen to reward a compensation for their mistakes. However still, they never attended to the claim. Refused to consider the claim and again took the direct debit for second year renewal. Their explanations in return is very rude and threatening. Stated that, I did only request DD return and not cancellation??Worst customer service ! I think these insurance companies are just here to scam people and provide no actual service in reality. People should go for the local tradesmen and get their boiler repaired from them instead of relying on these insurance companies who never delivery any service when needed. Please Avoid them at any cost !!"

10/12/2024,01/12/2024,Update: they got worse after the last mess they made,"Update:I would give a minus score if I could. Since the issues below, they did come to fix the door but didn't bother to sign the boiler off with its required checks during the appointment, a 5 minute job. Instead they rushed off and forgot. So we contacted them immediately and they asked for a new appointment. Tenant took more time off. Engineer came out again, arrived with a terrible temper. The boiler has a small decorative ledge on the front to stop the children putting their hands on it. It's one screw to take off. He said he won't remove it. The tenant cried this time because of his attitude and rudeness. Then he left. Job still not complete. I will be cancelling my contract today. This has been the most ridiculous process.  Original review in Sep:Pretty terrible experience since I've been with them. I hired them to install a new boiler and cover the heating system. They installed it, a year later when they serviced it they told me the last engineer had broken parts on it so they needed to fix it. They took ages to fix it and were barely reachable when organising dates/times.The year after another engineer came for a service, he shared that the last engineer had broken the boiler cover and it must be replaced. So again it has been a mess getting hold of the right team to get the cover replaced. Their call centre has no idea what they're doing or what team handles what issue. They tried to pin the cost back onto me when their own engineers admitted it being a problem on their end. They admitted it was their fault on the phone but said they wanted to charge me anyway! Finally, they relented. Insane!"

They send out engineers(cowboys) whom more likely to view and write reports only rather than to complete the task and finally I was told those blocks are not included in the policy. I had to call out plumbers from Checkatrade and job is done after 10 days of 24/7 saga. Surprisingly, this 24/7 is leading all the major comparison sites for boiler and drainage cover, not sure how.

The following day the kitchen was flooded again, I called back and was told the engineer would come out again. Half way through the day the engineer called to say there wasn't much point in the visit, as I had mentioned I was having a plumber come to check the pipes in 4 days and that he couldn’t do anything further. I complained and asked for my £95 excess back as the leak was not stopped and did not get resolved and I was refused. They then said I dismissed the engineer and would arrange my own plumber which doesn’t make sense and isn’t true. I’ve been a customer for many years but when my policy expires I will be going elsewhere. If you have an emergency, I wouldn’t call this company. "

10/12/2024,01/12/2024,Shocking service and gets worse,"Shocking service, started with a fault with hot water not being hot enough.Engineer visited and removed the heat exchange plate, did not refit it correctly. Contacted customer service daily with concerns of a substantial leak from the boiler. Absolutely awful They are trying to get the manufacturer to fix it under warranty for a fault the engineer has caused. 8th day with out heating and hot water. Waiting for a call back from a manager which could take 24hrs, but they have said if I buy heaters they will reimburse me upto £30 with a receipt. 9th day without heating/hot water, manager called me 23 hours in to their 24 hour time frame to get back to the customer.Still no resolution. Another cold night.10th day with out heating and hot water. Veissman engineer came out today, questioned if the engineer was even competent, in his words "" the worst job he's seen in 25 years"" Hundreds of pounds worth of damage caused to the boiler components. Ordered parts but if one part isn't in stock it will have to be ordered from Germany if this is the case the boiler won't be fixed until after Christmas.I will also have to pay for the parts because the warranty will be invalid due to 24/7 not servicing to the manufacturers instructions. All the factory seals are still in place internally proving the correct servicing procedure has not been followed.On a plus side I can spend £50 on heaters now. In for another cold one.Day 13, still no heating or hotwater, I've managed to arrange for the manufacturer to repair the boiler on Wednesday, cost me £366 due to the the damage being caused by a 3rd party (24/7 home rescue engineer) and the services,(had 2 off 24/7) not being carried out to the manufacturers instructions.15 days after 24/7 damaged the boiler finally got it repaired by Veissman, cost me £366.Now the pantomime of dealing with the complaints department, Absolutely awful. Started with an offer of £30 compensation for 15 days with out hot water or heating, to date they've upped it 3 times now we're hitting £100.Refused and have asked for it to be referred to the financial ombudsman."

Check the small print.  Don't let them take your money and assuming your boiler is protected. Aa I have been with them for the last 3 years, paying£17.99 a month for boiler abd heating system cover.

My annual boiler service was canceled twice—first due to ""unforeseen circumstances"" and the second time after I waited the entire day (engineer was meant to come between 1-6pm), only to be told at 5:30 PM that the engineer had faulty equipment. Half an hour before the first service, I got a call from the sales department asking me to pay £40 for an additional optional service to increase the boiler's longevity. I feel this might be the reason behind the cancellation as they want to prioritise those who are willing to pay extra on top of the premium costs. The next available appointment was over three months away. Because of 24/7's poor service, I've lost my boiler warranty. They seem more interested in taking money than actually serving their customers. In my opinion, this feels like a scam. I would not recommend them to anyone. I previously used Homeserve, whose service was far superior—at least 10 times better. The only reason I switched was because Homeserve raised their premium, but clearly, that was a mistake."

20/12/2024,01/12/2024,Shame I can’t give this company 0…,Shame I can’t give this company 0 stars. Moved into new property in August. Took out whole home cover. Boiler started leaking last week. Engineer came 4 days later after paying £95 and said he needed to order a part but stopped the leak and said we wouldn’t have any hot water until it was fixed. Received a call later that day saying I wasn’t covered as it was beyond economical repair as the boiler was too old. Details they had been provided with when I signed up. The part would have been covered but after adding 3 hours labour charge it wasn’t.  They could of course install a new boiler this week at only £40 a month for 10 years. I asked for a manager to call me back but by the time they attempted to call I had resolved my issue with someone more reputable. I have now received thinly vailed threatening messages that I am going to incur further costs for cancelling my direct debit. Companies like this should be avoided at all cost!

He resolved the problem with the boiler there and then. 24/7 are unable to give customers a specific time slot when booking a repair and say the slot is between 8am and 6pm - very difficult to manage this with a very full work diary. I was told I could ring on the day for a 2 hour window. I did that only to be told I’d been given incorrect info. Damian, excellent, but 24/7 customer service needs improving. The feedback should be disaggregated so I could give separate scores for the engineer and the company."

I cancelled my policy within my cancellation rights and they still haven’t processed the refund even after they said they will. Seriously save your money and go with a reputable company that has been trading for long time. Funny how all the true negative reviews get a reply stating they can’t find in their system.

In the process my hot water stopped working due to something one of the engineers did. The last engineer told me it was my hive receiver and they don’t cover it and I need to replace it. I did (at my own expense) and I still have NO HEATING. They keep saying they will refer to this team and that (deployment, authorisation) and call me back but they NEVER call back. I’ve even been ‘lucky’ to get check ins from a technical manager but he calls not knowing the latest status, and promising to call back without actually phoning back when he says he will. This is the worst service I have ever received!!!"

21/12/2024,01/12/2024,waste of money,"My boiler started leaking water in December 24 which meant shutting down the heating system to prevent damage to the room below.  It took 72 hours for the emergency engineer to attend despite the extreme low temperatures at the time. There was no offer of alternative heating and my request to have a manager prioritise a visit was ignored. The engineer's visit led to a demand for £191 for a repair (on top of the £45 call out charge/excess already taken).  I refused as I could see nothing in the policy I bought that suggested I was responsible for paying for the part and repair - that was why I paid £129 for the policy initially to cover these circs.  I eventually had the work done for free under my Aviva home contents and property insurance. They were so much more helpful. I bought this 24/7 policy expecting an urgent repair service - it was a complete waste of money - all they seem keen on is getting more and more from you. Look carefully at their cancellation charges before you sign up, and expect them to claim they cannot list every exclusion in their policy as it would take too much space."

22/12/2024,01/12/2024,Persistent contact when you decide to leave at the end of your policy,It is now January 13th and I am still getting reminders about renewing my policy. Now they are going straight to my junk inbox. They are probably still sending texts but as I have blocked them I no longer see them.So I have deleted my long review because I appreciate it was probably too long and that would mean the message I am trying to present is lost. So only buy a policy if you are prepared to keep getting reminders months after you decided to buy a cheaper policy with another company. Make sure if you do not renew with them to cancel your direct debit as soon as possible because it seems each reminder is sent because a failed attempt has been made by 24/7 to take payment. They are now taking the piss! I will never consider using them again because they do not seem to understand that people shop around and buy cheaper when they can especially considering there is no difference in cover. They have no intention of looking at this practise because they are still sending the reminders. My initial review was 3 stars because when I was covered by them I had no issues. Avoid avoid avoid!!!!!!!!!!!!

They charged me for 4 hours work £925…. with together with the call out charge would have been nearly £1000. Absolutely disgraceful. They initially came out …. as an emergency call on the Friday but the guy couldn’t do the job but I was still charged, then they sent John out the next day ( who was great ) on the Saturday but I was charged more because it was at the weekend. I was also told I would get a price for the job beforehand ….. never happened and I could kick myself for not asking. Just be careful with this company, great job done but scandalous charge.

Over £200 (not including monthly insurance charge) and a week later the boiler was repaired. I also read a review about ""beyond economical repair"" and when I asked to see guidance to see if my 12yo boiler was in that category I got nothing. Do not trust!"

In brief: 1) The boiler was neither serviced nor fixed within 13 months, despite the monthly fee; 2) When a fault was discovered, the cause of the fault was mis-diagnosed by the 247HR engineer (an independent engineer showed me that there was no fault in the named parts - the sump and the manifold); 3) I was initially charged for a chemical that was never used (as no work had been done) and received only a refund of this and my exit fee (not the year's fees charged beforehand);4) I had to fight for both refunds;5) Their communication leaves much to be desired.What this company lacks in service it makes up for with the crude tick-box and rapid stone-walling of its complaints' process. No matter how clearly you document your facts and provide evidence, you will get little recompense, as they are unregulated by the financial ombudsman and they know it. They returned fees that they should never have charged in the first place (by their own admission), but not the year's fees for zero service."

31/12/2024,01/12/2024,Only giving a 1 star review as I cannot give a Zero.,"Had an issue where my hot water wasn’t getting hot and my heating was stuck on all the time, and wouldn’t turn off no matter what I did.Contacted 247 on Boxing Day (This happened on Christmas Eve, but being nice I didn’t want to have to call an engineer out on Christmas Day) Turns out the earliest an engineer could attend anyway was 30th December. He quickly identified a fault in a switch which would need to be replaced. He said he would contact 247 to get approval to go ahead and would either return that day or on 31st.In preparation for doing the work, he turned off the heating to drain the system.He didn’t return on 30th and by lunchtime on 31st I called 247 back for an update, only to be told they were still awaiting the engineers report and quotation before they could authorise the repair. They were not interested that I live with my elderly mother who they have left with no heating for 2 days and said they should have the report by the end of today or possibly tomorrow and would call me back then.I asked to speak to a manager but was told there is a 24 hour wait for a managers call back.So now we have another day in a freezing cold house, with no heating or hot water.I doubt I will get a call back from a manager having read some other reviews, but I do hope I am proved wrong.This was my first ever time of having to call them out for an issue, and I am not impressed with their Customer Service, the agent was the most disinterested she could possibly be.Definitely avoid this company, I certainly won’t be renewing with them next year.UPDATEA manager did call me and was apologetic, said they had now received the information from the engineer and had agreed to the fix, but it required a drain down of the system, which I’m not covered for (even though I have the top level of cover) so another £108 spent (discounted from £145 due to the inconvenience) and now 1 day later and still no sign of the engineer, so another day/night sat in a freezing cold house with no heating or hot water."

Year,Product,Aspect,Analysis
2024,Gas Products,Overall,"## Gas Products  
**British Gas is seen as a trusted name for boiler services**, with strong feedback on engineer professionalism:  
> *""The engineer was very nice. He knew exactly how to solve the issue with the leakages in my boiler. He cleaned up after himself and explained everything clearly.""*

However, we are lagging behind **Corgi HomePlan and HomeServe** on **response times**, with multiple reviews highlighting delays in booking and quoting. Corgi HomePlan customers frequently mention speed:  
> *""Reported a heating fault Friday afternoon, plumber arrived 8 AM Saturday and fixed it fast.""*  

By contrast, BG customers often complain about slow processes:  
> *""Booked an engineer for a new boiler quote on 21 October. As of today, 7 November, still no quote!""*  

### Key Takeaways:  
1. **Improve turnaround on quotes and bookings** – Corgi and HomeServe are winning on speed.  
2. **Maintain engineer professionalism** – This is a strong point and a key differentiator we should emphasize.  
"
2024,Plumbing & Drains,Overall,"## Plumbing & Drains  
**British Gas (via Dyno-Rod) is highly regarded for fixing issues efficiently** and has a **strong reputation for skilled engineers**:  
> *""Very nice engineer who found a leak that other workers missed when doing renovations months ago.""*  

Where we struggle is **pricing transparency**, with many customers feeling **overcharged** compared to Checkatrade and independent plumbers.  
> *""Paid £60 excess, then my premium increased by £60 for a single callout. Basically, I paid £120 for a 30-minute job!""*  

Checkatrade competitors are seen as more cost-effective:  
> *""Blocked sewer sorted in an hour. Excellent service and good value.""*  

### Key Takeaways:  
1. **Improve price communication** – Customers feel misled on costs; clear upfront pricing could improve sentiment.  
2. **Maintain our service reputation** – Engineers are well-regarded; better price perception could make us the market leader.  
"
2024,Home Electrical,Overall,"## Home Electrical  
**British Gas is perceived as highly capable when engineers show up**, with strong reviews on work quality:  
> *""Electrical repair carried out professionally, with a friendly and thorough service.""*  

However, we are **behind Checkatrade and 24/7 Home Rescue** in reliability. **Missed or cancelled appointments** are a recurring complaint:  
> *""Had a repair request a month ago, rebooked three times, engineer didn’t turn up each time.""*  

Checkatrade customers highlight their reliability:  
> *""Found a really good electrician for the work I needed.""*  

Meanwhile, 24/7 Home Rescue has its own issues with emergency response times, which presents an opportunity for us to win dissatisfied customers.  

### Key Takeaways:  
1. **Reduce missed appointments** – A major frustration that competitors handle better.  
2. **Opportunity in emergency callouts** – 24/7 Home Rescue struggles here; we can capture market share by improving response times.

> *""Easy process to book a repair. First date given was next day!""*  

Meanwhile, BG customers express frustration with slower appointment availability.  

### Key Takeaways:  
1. **Speed up appointment scheduling** – Next-day service is becoming the norm among competitors.  
2. **Keep service quality high** – Customers value our expertise; ensuring faster access to it will drive retention.

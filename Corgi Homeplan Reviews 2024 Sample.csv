02/01/2024,5,Super Service,"No heating or hot water between christmas/ny but I was sent the wonderful Laurence who still came at 7pm after a long busy day. He identified what was wrong, managed to get the part the next day and came back at 6pm the next evening as promised and stayed until it was fixed after another problem occurred.  He left at 8 on a Sat evening having mended it all.  Beyond call of duty.  Thank you.",Corgi Homeplan

If I had not, we would be financing a new boiler, due to the first engineer writing it off, and leaving my home with no heating or hot water.To be clear the second engineer who came was excellent, he sorted it out and got us up and running.",Corgi Homeplan

03/01/2024,1,Beyond Pointless - They refuse to cover anything.,"If it was possible to give this company 0 starts I would. I had been a long standing customer of Corgi Homeplan for several years but after they refused to settle a claim saying a radiator was incorrectly installed (it was installed 8 years prior to us moving into the property). After speaking to the plumber (who was sent) and ended up mending it privately for us - he said the engineers (like him) don't get paid anything by Corgi for the callout fee which means their ""callout fee"" is essentially admin cost and they always have to battle with them for any kind of money... I questioned why I even bothered having insurance first place. After battling with the pointless complaints process I just gave up and I'd avoid as they never actually covered anything in the years we had them (we'd used them multiple times for small boiler faults and other heating related issues but never anything beyond 1/2 hours work) it just became apparent it was a waste of money.",Corgi Homeplan

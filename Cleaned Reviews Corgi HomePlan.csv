After speaking to the plumber (who was sent) and ended up mending it privately for us - he said the engineers (like him) don't get paid anything by Corgi for the callout fee which means their ""callout fee"" is essentially admin cost and they always have to battle with them for any kind of money... I questioned why I even bothered having insurance first place. After battling with the pointless complaints process I just gave up and I'd avoid as they never actually covered anything in the years we had them (we'd used them multiple times for small boiler faults and other heating related issues but never anything beyond 1/2 hours work) it just became apparent it was a waste of money.",LABEL_0,0.933,en,True,True,1.0

After four engineer visits I was advised my boiler was beyond economical repair. I admit the boiler was over ten years old. Although it had been covered since brand new by Corgi. However I was informed parts are still readily available via the manufacturer. I firmly believe I was cast aside because this was a big ticket repair, but still repairable. That information came direct from a boiler technician sent via Corgi from the boiler manufacturer. I was also informed that Corgi will send in the cheapest engineer they can contact in your area. This may result in a less qualified engineer attending your property who may not have the necessary skills to correctly diagnose faults with your boiler. Please note, I can‚Äôt verify this claim. But this is my own experience after they sent a fully qualified boiler technician from the manufacturer after Corgi‚Äôs own boiler engineers 4th visit without correctly diagnosing the fault. I have now had a new boiler fitted by a fully qualified ex manufacturer employee who runs his own business. More than happy with the quality of work and cost to supply and fit.

I explained I was a 72 year old female who is not only a carer for my husband, but also a cancer patient on treatment, and a newly diagnosed heart failure patient. I had laid in the water on the floor twice to try and turn off the water valve, and stood for 2 hour's emptying water that was still coming from the boiler. This was a very traumatic event, which wasn't helped by the attitude of the engineer on his arrival.

16/02/2024,01/02/2024,Gas Products,In July 2023 my hot water system and two power showers were working perfectly. I then noticed a slight leak from my hot water cylinder. The engineer from corgi decided the cylinder needed to be replaced. It was replaced in august 2023 and the pipe work was altered to accommodate the new cylinder. As soon as the controller called for hot water a tremendous droning started akin to an aircraft overhead. At the same time one of my power showers would no longer function as it could no longer get enough hot water flow. Over the next six months I had a succession of five different engineers from corgi. Eventually the cylinder was replaced again and the droning was fixed however the shower still does not function and corgi will not accept any responsibility for fixing it. I will not be renewing with corgi and will instead be detailing my experience to the insurance ombudsman.Corgi homeplan have responded to my trustpilot review claiming they have arrived at a decision regarding my complaint but this has not been made available to me,LABEL_0,0.828,en,True,True,1.0

I called Corgiplan and was told the earliest an engineer could come was 24 hours from then. In the meantime, they did not advise how to stop the water flooding my bathroom, so I took it upon myself to google it, and it said cut the water, switch the boiler off. So we had no hot water or heating for 24 hours; I told them this, they said they were 'busy'. No advice whatsoever. I even told them I have a vulnerable person in the house, which they didn't really care about. 24 hours later, an engineer turned up, didn't touch anything, said he couldn't do it, as the radiator fell, and it was 'installer error'. I explained that the radiator,  bathroom, and extension was over 20 years old, and do they not allow for wear and tear. They said they do, but they said the engineer said it was installer error, which they do not cover. He then left, leaving us with no hot water or heating, for another 24 hours with a vulnerable person. Support staff on the phone called me to explain that they do not cover installer error, I argued that this is a 20 year old bathroom so how could it be installer error after 20 years! He finally listened and agreed to send another engineer. The engineer came (more than 2.5 days without hot water or heating, with a vulnerable person in the house). He said, oh that's fine, and proceeded to repair the problem within a couple of hours! WHAT A DISGRACE ON CORGI HOME PLANS PART TO HAVE NO EMPATHY AND IN FACT, ACCUSE THE CUSTOMER TO TRY AND GET OUT OF REPAIRING A GENIUNE ISSUE.

02/03/2024,01/03/2024,Gas Products,I‚Äôve always been very pleased with Corgi. If it‚Äôs an emergency they send a plumber quickly. The annual service was yesterday and I‚Äôm afraid the heating engineer was compelled to condemn my boiler. To be fair it was probably getting towards the end of its useful life. However the main reason was because an earlier engineer - we think in 2018 had put in a new flue and either broke or failed to fit the flue collector bracket - leaving me somewhat vulnerable! I have arranged for a new boiler to be fitted/ in the meantime I am ignoring the advice as I can‚Äôt be without heating and hot water for three weeks. Another three weeks should not make much difference given how long it‚Äôs been like that! I would have given Corgi 5 * but this has shaken my confidence slightly. There are two other faults which could have been remedied during the service. ,LABEL_0,0.932,en,True,True,1.0

Got my own engineer who confirmed it was a boiler issue (either faulty heat exchanger or flow switch) after checking various things.Eventually charged me ¬£60 excess for an engineer to attend my house.  Their engineer was in my house for the whole of 5 minutes, didn't even touch my boiler despite my independent heating engineer stating it was either a faulty flow switch or heat exchanger.Refused to contact my independent engineer.Complaint raised and they sent out a second engineer, second engineer again didn't touch the boiler, just asked me about 10 questions, said it was my shower and left, maybe in my house for 10 minutes (at best).Ended up cancelling the policy and they charged me ¬£136 for the priviledge.  Im sat in hospital having had a heart attack, just checked my online banking and they've taken ¬£136 from my account.  They didnt pay the claim....so why would they collect the remaining contract balance; because they operate unethically.Cost me hundreds of pounds to sort, and thats without the additional ¬£136 they've diddled me out of!Waste of money, they want investigating by the Financial Conduct Authority! RESPONSE TO CORGIPLAN REPLYI do not accept your insincere apology, your engineers didn't even look at the boiler.  Your team refused to contact my independent engineer.  You did not pay the claim.  You have collected ¬£136 from my bank for no services provided. Your engineers spent less than 15 minutes in my home, Ive done more work on that boiler than Corgiplan just by switching it on, never mind the additional works undertaken.  Your engineers services are minimal at best, they did nothing, absolutely nothing. You've conned me, there is no doubt in my mind.

Corgi did not  keep us informed of the progress of the claim and were surprised when I phoned up wanting to know what was happening, not a good experience really. ",LABEL_0,0.93,en,True,True,1.0

22/03/2024,01/03/2024,Gas Products,"In November 2023 I joined OVO who had a promotional offer with their sister company Corgi. The offer was six months free boiler cover. However, after shopping around a bit more, I decided to change my supplier during the 14 day COOLING OFF PERIOD. No payment or contract was ever set up with OVO or Corgi as I was entitled to cancel and I thought that was that.Well, March 2024 ¬£15 had been taken from my account from Corgi. When I queried this with OVO they explained that it was Corgi I needed to speak to as they were the ones who had taken payment. This didn‚Äôt make any sense to me as I had never given Corgi my direct debit details. However, as I had made the contract with OVO (and cancelled within the 14 day cooling off period) I realised it must have been passed on to them.OVO stated I needed to contact Corgi which I duly did.  They explained that when making the contract with OVO and cancelling during the 14 day cooling off period, I had to also contact them. How does that even make any sense?? When I told Corgi I had never been with OVO and they had no right to pass my direct debit details onto them as I had cancelled within the legal time limit of 14 days, they completely neglected this and stated if I wanted to get out of contract I would have to pay an additional ¬£55. They have now made ¬£70 off me for doing nothing. ¬£70 in a cost of living crisis and ¬£70 because I apparently had to call them directly to state I was no longer with OVO and therefore did not want boiler cover.It is one big promotional scam.Corgi is meant to be a trusted company. Their joining with OVO is far from that. I have never given them permission to take money from my account. Never. Yet OVO passed on my details in that cooling off period and did not advise that you have to call them separately as in this case they now act as a separate entity- as it suits them!!I will be contacting the ombudsman because I am appalled at this act of actual daylight robbery.",LABEL_0,0.829,en,True,True,1.0

The policy states external thermostats are covered, but several paragraphs and points later there is a badly worded exclusion which means online thermostats are not covered (although it doesn't say thermostat). According to the complaints department it's my fault as it's my responsibility to check all the wording. So this is a warning to anyone with a nest, hive, tado or other control, you will not be covered for thermostat issues.

I had trouble with my boiler December - February and latterly could not get through to them at all when I called out a local man who came promptly next morning and did a thorough job to get my boiler working properly.  The man who came to fix my boiler from OVO in December said if it goes again I'd need a new control panel.  The boiler worked for about 2 weeks and then started causing problems limping along to February.I put in a complaint to OVO which was ignored for a month and they continued to take my direct debit payment in March despite me telling them not to take more money from my bank until the complaint was dealt with.   They have ignored the fact that my boiler was not working properly throughout, told me that there was nothing wrong with their phones and said their boiler cover does not cover a full strip down of the boiler (not really a good service if your boiler breaks down if they only cover the bare minimum).  So I cancelled my contract for which they charged me a cancellation fee when they left my boiler in an unfit state.So my advice is to use your local heating engineer - someone who is going to do a thorough job to ensure your boiler works properly and safely.",LABEL_0,0.923,en,True,False,0.9

Don't know where all the positive reviews come from but they definitely do not ring true from my experience. Have a leak suspected in my kitchen or bathroom but because I can't identify where the leak is coming from corgi won't come out. Paying ¬£34 a month for them to do nothing and they want me to opt in for auto renewal so it's more convenient for me...right ! And to top it off it takes them a minimum of 9 months to have an annual boiler service. Complete sham company who don't do a single thing to help the customer. Merely.interested in lining their own pockets. I would completely avoid this company like the plague and if you have read this review and decided to take out a policy with corgi more fool you.  31.5.24 sounds like corgy plumbers are not covered to do any work.

31/08/2024,01/08/2024,Gas Products,Corgi are a shambles. Last year they sent two plumbers over 3 visits to fix the toilet leaking but said it was not fixable. Eventually I got the replacement part from Amazon for ¬£26 and then watched a you tube video. After 15 minutes I had fixed it. It took months of arguing with Corgi to get the excess they charged me refunded. Unfortunately for me they auto renewed my policy so I ended up stuck with them for a further 12 months. During the routine boiler service they discovered a defective seal and advised not to use until seal replaced. Said they will get part and send engineer in few days. A new engineer from the manufacture called and said they will be with us on Saturday two days later. I cancelled my weekend away and when he arrived he wanted to know what‚Äôs wrong with exclaiming we never carry parts so I said why have you come then. He said he will order parts and come next week. He left and then returned to say he has decided to cut the gas pipe to boiler which was not unsafe but he didn‚Äôt want me to try using it despite already not turning in on for last two days. I asked him to leave and come back when he has parts. The next thing is he called gas board and they came threatening to force entry to property. They wanted to cut gas to entire property with no cooking allowed either. We then spent 5 hours with a stand off whilst Corgi sourced another engineer to be able to just cut of boiler. All this was so unnecessary as the first engineer had turned off boiler. Corgi should have returned with the parts not sent another engineer who couldn‚Äôt do anything further. I even had to lend him my own screwdrivers as he left his in the van.He re-entered my property uninvited. I have been under siege today on this single engineers say so.All corgi engineers are freelance some are great but if you get the rubbish one you are in real trouble as Corgi have no say over them.,LABEL_0,0.913,en,True,True,1.0

11/09/2024,01/09/2024,Gas Products,Our boiler service was almodt due and an engineer called us to arrange a visit. He explained he was doing another job as well as services for Corgi but could fit us in after 6pm during his holiday. Sept 4th was the date. It was the last day of our holiday so we rushed back to make sure we were available. He duly arrived on the drive but said he couldn't do the work and showed us an email from Corgi saying his public liability insurance had expired. He said Corgi would be in touch to re- arrange. On Monday 9th Sept we woke up to no hot water and no heating. My husband contacted Corgi Homeplan and requested urgent assistance. We had a call at 7pm that evening but we were not available so he said he would call Tues before 10am. By noon we had heard nothing. We chased and said it was urgent etc.... finally an engineer came after 6pm and said parts were required from Worcester Bosch and they would call that evening or Wed 1st thing to organise to provide the parts and do the work within 48hrs. No call from Worcester Bosch.  10.19am Wed they called and said it would be another 2 days.I chased Corgi again around 11.30am and said I wanted to raise a complaint and speak to a manager. I was on hold  for 30 minutes. I was told I could only get a manager on call back they couldn't put me through. Third day with no hot water- my husband is in his 70s and had a procedure under sedation at hospital at 2.30pm Wed afternoon so he had to have a cold shower. By 4.25pm no manager had called. I rang again. Another 30minutes until phone answered. I was told the wrong manager had been requested to call but had been looking into our issue - for 6hours!!! The customer service for Corgi is appalling  the last call resulted in me being told the parts people and customer relations aren't available after 5pm which is really helpful after customers sit on hold for 30mins every time they contact you. We have been told someone should get back to us tomorrow. We are sitting in a cold house with no hot water. My advice is DO NOT TOUCH CORGI HOMEPLAN. I have made it abundantly clear this is NOT acceptable and their management are to blame. I want my policy payments refunded at the very least and I'm tempted to book into a hotel and send Corgi the bill. I am furious. They do not deserve the business and have no respect for customers who have been with them for many years. ,LABEL_0,0.89,en,True,True,1.0

According to the pleasant lady who called from Corgi to claim the excess, it was a shame that the damage hadn't been spotted within 12 months - suggesting that it would then have been rectified without paying the excess.I really don't see how that can work; Corgi offer the service date and I was not offered one within 12 months of the previous service.

When I called I logged a complaint as it was clear the engineer did not want to do the work. He was approx 30th engineer you contacted. By this point we had been without water for 3 days. But it wasn't an ""emergency "" as the water was off. Finally after asking what the budget was and we would find someone local you sent an engineer on day 4. He was at the house no more than an 1hr30min and the jobs was done as discussed with your 1st engineer. This guy was practical and considerate and he didn't waste time in getting it sorted. On day 4 of all of this our downstairs sockets tripped and would not reset. We thought that water from the leak might be involved, the engineer came and identified the fault on day 5 (nothing to do with the water) made a temporary fix by removing the room that was tripping it. He wrote a quote to corgi to get the work completed. I called corgi to check it was in the policy and on day 7 the new ring main was installed.

The engineer came and blamed my solar system saying it had caused a valve to fail and on second visit fitted a very cheap new valve.  This valve lasted but 24 hours before it failed.  Today Worcester Bosch came to see if I had a boiler failure of some kind as there was no power showing on the boiler.  This engineer said the failure was in the airing cupboard.  He identified the new valve of very poor quality had failed.  Another local plumber attended.. replaced the troublesome valve and got the heating going again.  All of this nonsense took over a week to resolve and in the end I simply paid for a good quality valve and the time of a very competent local plumber.

(Having rung and said he was going to be late, but did not ring to let us know he wouldn‚Äôt be coming) I was unable to rebook online so had to ring to rebook - was told an engineer would ring me to arrange - this never happened and I just got an email to link to the booking page. Having booked a second date (same engineer üò°) exactly the same happened - he rang to say he would be late then never turned up or bothered to ring to say he would not be coming. Two days of taking time off work and waiting all day for someone to turn up when the slot booked was 8am-12pm. I was extremely angry when I rang to rebook - I think I should have been some compensation but this didn‚Äôt happen. Again, all that happened was an email sent, linking to the booking site. No formal apology for the inconvenience. Poor customer service. Luckily the third time was fine (I had told Corgi I would NOT accept the original engineer to be nominated) and the engineer who attended on time was great - thorough and polite, 30 mins later it was all done.

06/11/2024,01/11/2024,Gas Products,"SUMMER 2024The ‚Äúengineer‚Äù (overused job title, it should at best be technician) didn‚Äôt do essential things but did do unnecessary things. I‚Äôve previously had my boiler serviced by Vaillant, I also have a background in engineering, so I have a good understanding of what needs to be done.With the exception of the flue gases check, the OVO/CORGI service was a complete waste of time and if it wasn‚Äôt already included within my ‚Äúplan‚Äù I would not have paid for it.The ‚Äúengineer‚Äù who visited did virtually nothing. After a visual check, the only technical thing he did was to check the flue readings.He did not remove the cover to the combustion chamber and so did not clean and vacuum the surface of the heat exchanger and so did not fit a new graphite gasket (I believe the Vaillant recommended service interval is 2 years). I asked if he was going to change the gasket, he called head office and they said no!He did not clean the siphon/trap which tends to fill up with the debris from the heat exchanger.He did, however, waste his time cleaning the Magnaclean filter ‚Äì this is external to the boiler, a waste of time as I do it myself every couple of months!So, on a Saturday morning a couple of weeks ago, my boiler stopped working due to the siphon being blocked with the debris from the combustion chamber! For simplicity, I unblocked it myself rather than make a call and have to wait.The level of service undertaken was, to my mind, ineffective and will, ultimately, result in a problem and/or a failure and the need for a call out. I have arranged for a local plumber to visit and undertake a thorough clean of all pipework, the heat exchanger (inc. gasket) and the siphon.A MORAL? If you are going to undertake a boiler service then I suggest you undertake the service to the same, or preferably a higher standard to the manufacturer, not the absolute bare minimum requirement. This is lulling most people into a false sense of security and they‚Äôre not getting what they think they‚Äôre paying for.

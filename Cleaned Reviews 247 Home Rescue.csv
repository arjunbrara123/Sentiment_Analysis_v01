01/01/2024,01/01/2024,Gas Products,If I could give this company 0 stars I would. The service we have received is absolutely disgusting. I’ve rang 6/7 times today chasing an engineer to come out and fix our boiler. For the last three days now we’ve had no heating or hot water. They told us they have referred our job to the manufacturer which is a load of crap. I rang the manufacture and they have no record of the job! Absolutely disgusting customer service. Payed a call outout fee of £45 and the engineer didn’t even take the boiler apart. He just looked at it. Don’t go with these cowboys.,LABEL_0,0.924,en,True,False,0.9
02/01/2024,01/01/2024,Gas Products,"Please read this review before placing your trust in this business. It would take me a week to detail all the areas where 247 let us down and behave in a manner which is beyond dodgy! Just a few are: 1. Abusing our personal details to repeatedly call, when you have expressly told them not to on several occasions. 2. Sending a racist engineer who told us ‘he only works for P****** because they pay him £15k a year more than his previous employer3. Supplying official paperwork telling us we needed essential safety work (not covered by our policy of course) despite never having carried out the necessary observation/ assessment of the area concerned. 4. Making critical errors in paperwork. Our boiler was serviced on 17/11/23; the date given for the next service required? 17/11/23. 5. Offering to quote for unnecessary work, which was described as a safety issue. 6. Their engineers will warn you that despite writing ‘customer not interested in new boiler’ you will get a call trying to sell you one, because that’s all they’re interested in. Taking your money! 7. Offering 3 months compensation for their poor service and engineer’s behaviour, then when you reiterate you want your contact details removed from their records, they cancel your policy completely, 3 months early, leaving you completely without cover over the winter. If you are considering this company for your boiler cover, be warned. Their customer service agents are ‘not allowed’ to escalate complaints to the managers. Apparently when their engineers tell you ‘they are all greedy (racist term!) who are only interested in taking your money’, they may indeed be speaking from experience.",LABEL_0,0.773,en,True,True,1.0

02/01/2024,01/01/2024,Gas Products,"Don't know about you, but mine's often dim so I don't get to predict the future much. However, when it comes to the central heating boiler I know what could happen in the future if it isn't given a little TLC, which means an annual check at least. Here's where the people at 24/7 home rescue come into their own. For not a lot of wonga they provide the necessary, which doesn't have to include the entire heating system, but does cover everything boiler.  Fortunately I have the tools and experience to cope with the rest, so I only need the boiler taking care of with the afore mentioned TLC. Once found their website is easy to navigate and the form filling's a breeze, checkout's not at all complicated, and did I mention it's affordable ?All necessary documentation arrives via email PDF so no snail mail, and if like me you like to have a hard copy to hand it's done and dusted in minutes.Talking of which I need to go and give my crystal ball a polish.",LABEL_0,0.928,en,True,False,0.9

The engineer was quick to arrive but after spending 1 hour the engineer couldn't find out what was wrong with the boiler.  In the end he gave up and said he needs to order a new front panel which he will do today and will be back either same day or Wednesday 3rd January 24. I was very understanding as I know its holidays etc so I will have to survive with no heating and no hot water for next few days. Received call today on the 2nd January 24 and I was told they ordered the part today and it now now be delivered and fixed on the 9th. I am family of 4 with 2 young kids. One child is under 3 years. We have been left to die in this cold weather with no heating or hot water. We all are ill due to cold weather and using cold water. 4 days no one had a shower.i have been left with extreme disappointment as I paid the highest amount per month to this company from day 1. Never missed a payment and in return what I get? Lies, delays and no positive response or help.Would really like a manger to call me to resolve this issue ASAP otherwise I will take my complaint further to OMBUDSMAN.

03/01/2024,01/01/2024,Unknown,"My annually invoiced contract was coming up for renewal at the end of January and I had an email advisory from this company saying that the monthly equivalent (but annually billed) rate was going up from just over 5 pounds per month to over 14 pounds per month! So an over 2.5 times increase in premium. I had no claims and the same items of equipment i.e. no changes at all. I informed them that I would not be renewing based on this. Within a couple of days, I had a further email now saying they could do it for just over 8 pounds per month. It's like dealing with a shady used car dealership. I don't want a negotiation- I want a rock-solid reliable provider. I declined their volatile offer and canceled the renewal direct debit due in a few weeks. I then received a further email saying that my account is immediately suspended even though I have a few weeks left. So they have declined to provide a full years cover purely because I don't agree to a massive price increase and a renewal for the next year. I will certainly not be using them again and thankfully never had to lodge a claim. Now, they will respond to this post by either saying: (a) they can't identify me (i.e. this is intended to convince you, new Customer, that this is a fake review- it's not) or (b) please call us to discuss (that is intended to show you, new customer, how customer focussed they are and is not intended to offer me anything different).I guess my rating and advice on this vendor is pretty clear.",LABEL_0,0.926,en,True,True,1.0

He noticed something that hadn't been done properly by last person and missed by previous maintenance from another company. Fantastic service from him! Regarding 24 /7 it takes a long time to get visit booked in and previous one got cancelled so waited another month but least worth it in the end and they did call before to try and sell me a product which I said no to.

They are supposed to supply 2 heaters if they cannot fix the heating they tell me I have to buy these and they will reimburse me  £30 - um no thanks decent heaters cost more than £30 each. the call system is a joke where the agents blame you for the delay in repairs. The complaints department if it exists seems to be unreachable. I feel like I am being SCAMMED by this company the contract is pretty much worthless.AVOID at all costs - the company name gives a feeling of immediate repairs  - pigs will fly firstUPDATE: they want me to pay the 108.00 and they will credit me 2 months premiums (about £26.00) as a gesture of good will.... its a joke shove the offer .... 7 days without heating and now 2 days with no hot water. Its costing me an extra 10 to 15 per day in additional cost for heating and hot water and they still wont resolve my heating.

They repeatedly stated that an engineer would arrive as late as 19:30 hrs yesterday, which is laughable. It's particularly distressing as we clearly communicated that we have children at home, and it's becoming a nightmare without hot water and heating.Calling them again today did no good as they still had no intel on their engineer's whereabouts. Their lack of responsibility in keeping customers apprised of the progress is alarming. Moreover, my request for a callback from a manager has been blatantly ignored thus far, and we're still left shivering in the cold.The company's name, '24/7 Home Rescue,' feels like a mockery given this undeserving experience.

12/01/2024,01/01/2024,Gas Products,"I experienced extremely poor service from this company. They conducted an inspection of my boiler, which was functioning perfectly. However, the engineer arbitrarily shut down the boiler and left. Consequently, my children and I have been enduring freezing temperatures without access to hot water and heating. Upon contacting the company, I was informed of an issue but was told to wait 24 hours for a team to check for necessary parts.After the stipulated time, I called again, only to be informed that they could obtain the required part for a fee of £90. However, an additional waiting period of 24 hours was necessary for the booking team to contact me and schedule an appointment. Despite paying for the repair, the technicians arrived days later and departed without resolving the issue. Subsequent calls revealed that another part was needed, and I was required to wait for authorization for the purchase of the new part. Upon calling after 24 hours, I was informed of a charge of £340 for the additional part. This seemed absurd, considering I had already paid £90.Expressing my dissatisfaction, I requested to cancel the service, but I was told that I needed to pay £99, even though I was within the cooling-off period. I argued that I had already paid £90 for their service, which was not provided free of charge. However, they insisted on the £99 payment. In light of this experience, I strongly advise against choosing this company, as they lack competence and seem more interested in promoting expensive new boilers or charging exorbitant amounts than providing genuine assistance.

I did not receive any confirmation of the appointment and had to call to chase this up. I work full time and I had to book a day off work for this. Booking time off work in my line of work (healthcare) at this time of the year is difficult enough. On the afternoon of the day before the boiler service was due I received a call cancelling my appointment. The next available date offered to me was 2 months away. After speaking to a rather unhelpful customer service representative, I managed to bring this down to a month. Suffice to say that a routine boiler service is costing me two days off work in a time when my workplace is under such an enormous pressure. My boiler is working fine but I have noticed the dial on one of the controls being in the red. I was relying on this visit to get this back into the green. I have had a boiler broken before because I attempted to ""fix"" it and I am naturally apprehensive to endeavour to fix things myself.  Every time I had a boiler service in the past, it has not taken longer that 10 minutes, even on my old 15 years old boiler.

16/01/2024,01/01/2024,Gas Products,"For me, 24/7 wasn’t worth the money. I had a policy for over 3 years and never claimed - when the time finally came, they weren’t able to get someone over quickly. Given I had no heating, and a small child at home, I called around to find someone locally. It cost me £150 to get a local plumber to come out on the same day, but given 24/7 Home Rescue costs £41 per month, you’re paying £492 per year. You need 3 breakdowns to make that stack up and you need to be confident that they can actually deliver quickly in an emergency situation (hence the name). They didn’t for me. Additionally, customer service is painful. I spent 28 minutes on the phone trying to cancel. They offered me a bunch of minor incentives to change my mind, like £40 credit, £30 towards a temporary electric heater and £5 off my monthly fee etc.They also told me I’d have to pay expensive fees if I cancelled - I had my terms to hand, so I could rebuff that easily, but for someone caught unprepared, they’d be forgiven for aborting the cancellation under the threat of fictitious fees. I guess you can’t fault them for trying.Just as I thought I had finally finished cancelling, I was transferred over to the team leader, who spent a good 10 minutes trying to explain to me that if I canceled 24/7 Home Rescue, I would have to pay somebody else money if ever my boiler broke, but with 24/7 Home Rescue, I wouldn’t… (except the £492 per year… right). She was also particularly forceful in telling me why I was wrong. Finally, about 5 mins after I reported my issue I got an unsolicited sales call, presumably from a different department - unbelievably they tried to sell me a new boiler. He started off by saying “I know you’ve had trouble with your boiler and we couldn’t get a someone over”… he asked my boiler age etc - I thought he was trying to resolve my issue and get someone over faster…. until he proceeded with his sales pitch - 🤦🏻Lordy Lordy",LABEL_0,0.899,en,True,True,1.0

27/01/2024,01/01/2024,Gas Products,AVOID THIS COMPANY!!Had the boiler cover with my24/7 for 4 years and always booked the annual service which always amazed me that they could fully service in the time they was here! Booked for this year's service and engineer arrived not having a clue how to use the tado system which is one of the popular WiFi heating controllers so didn't have much confidence right from the off.  Within 5 minutes of him there the boiler had mysteriously packed up and wasn't working at all. Even tho the boiler had been working perfectly fine all year and was working as he managed to get a emissions reading from it. He then said he couldn't do no more and left! Leaving me with no heating with a family with children isn't very good at all.  Couple of days after I get a call saying that they will send out a service engineer only after I've paid £75! I begrudgingly paid up and waited a day for him to turn up. He turned up not happy that he had to work on Sunday and couldn't wait to get to the pub! Told me boiler was beyond economical repair and left again with no heating in the coldest spell we've had this year!! To say my house and kids was freezing is a understatement! Finally 9 days after it stopped working on a so called service and me having to chase them all the time they finally say they can't do anything and cancel my contract with them!! Now stuck with a dead boiler that I've now got to sort out.   Over the year they have bombarded me with phone calls trying to get me to upgrade my ageing boiler with the same response that if its working fine im leaving alone.  This company will only want to take all your money and help out the least they can !!!

31/01/2024,01/01/2024,Gas Products,I strongly advice you to steer clear of this company.  I took out service for my combi boiler with them.  I paid monthly then when the boiler broke down on 14th January 2023 I had to pay a fee of £75 before they would agree to send an engineer.  I am 81 years old and was supposed to get priority treatment because of my age.  The engineer didn’t turn up for 2days.  This happened right at the beginning of that bitterly cold week we had mid January.  The engineer said the boiler needed a new fan and he would return later with that.  After 30 minutes I got a call from the company trying to sell me a new boiler. I quoted what the engineer had said about a new fan.  An hour later I got another call from them trying to sell me a boiler.  I stated quite categorically I didn’t want a new boiler because my current boiler only needed a new fan.  Later that day I got another call from said company stating the engineer would not be returning with a fan because the boiler didn’t warrant that expense (about £100).  They refused to refund my monthly payments or the £75 fee.  I got nothing at all for my money.  I subsequently purchased a new boiler - not from them of course.  I was without heat and water for a full week before the new boiler was installed.  Home Rescue couldn’t have cared less.  Do not under any circumstances give them your money.,LABEL_0,0.911,en,True,True,1.0

31/01/2024,01/01/2024,Gas Products,"Complaint Reference: TF1087026Full Policy £26.99On the first November 2023 I called 24/7 as we had heavy rainfall and there was water leaking from the bottom of the boiler. An engineer came at 6pm in total darkness.  He was immediately rude stating this was his last job and he just wanted to get to the pub. I offered him tea or coffee and he was rude again stating he didn't drink that crap.  I offered him a torch as it was so dark but he didn't want one as he had his phone. I left him to it.  A few minutes later he came in and said he had cut a piece of pipe off and put it on my kitchen worktop.  He said the pipe was incorrectly installed and someone from the office would call me to sort out where we go from there.A couple of weeks later I saw that the drain the boiler pipe went into was overflowing.  I called the company and an engineer came and unblocked the drain. He stated that the pipe was blocked and that is why the water was coming out of the bottom of my boiler and if it hadn't of been dark the boiler engineer would have seen that.  I repeatedly called the company to find out what was being done about my pipework and was told three times that the job had been closed.  I was passed from one department to another and eventually in January 2024 I was told that nobody would be calling out as it was an ""incorrect installation"".I explained it was installed and maintained under the Worcester 7 year warranty and then has had the last two yearly maintenance certificates by a well known homecare company. So apparently there are 9 gas certified heating engineers that are not doing their jobs properly according to 24/7.  I asked to speak with a manager as I now have an independant quote for £140 bill to pay to repair the cut pipework, I spoke with four different people who appeared to just be reading from a script and not answering my direct questions  and they refused to pass me on to a manager.  I asked to terminate my contract and was told it was yet another department I needed to speak with.   Eventually I was told it would cost me £186 the chap then asked me to wait a moment and then came back saying I could terminate it for £135.  I said the £140 repair that I now had to pay because of their error  should be offset against the £135 to get me out of the contract.  He stated that this was not possible.  I asked once again to speak with a senior person.  I then received a telephone call offering me £30 compensation which obviously said I did not want as I no longer had any faith in the company.  I then received another telephone call the day after offering me £50 compensation, to which I declined.  I was then offered the £50 compensation as part of a reduction of the £186 contract exit fee.  I also received a letter offering the compensation with a detailed letter of my problem stating the dates November 2024 (REALLY).  The incompetencies within this company are outstanding.

An independent engineer has completed a riddor report about their concerns from what was found and cadent are in discussion about this as it’s the 2nd gas leak within 2 months since this company messed around with my boiler.They don’t do a tightness test so you’ll be unaware if you have a leak after the boiler is ‘serviced’ get a proper independent engineer who carries out all safety gas leak checks.",LABEL_0,0.748,en,True,True,1.0

So I chose this this company little that I know it’s the  worst out of all the other companies.  So I booked a gas safety check and a boiler service for the earliest appointment they could give me which was 10/1/24 which was cancelled  a day before. And was  reschedule for another day which was the 18/jan, I heard nothing from the company for about 10 days kept looking at their app and there’s no paperwork or cp12certificate or  a report from the engineer the only thing it shows job completed so I called the customer service and here where I I realised how bad is this company…. I was told the our engineer attended the job and he refused to carry out the work ⛔️⛔️…. (As he said that the gas meter is too close to the electric switch board) bear in mind this has been the case sines I bought the house (no one has touched the gas meter or moved it and so is the electric) and several  gas safety registered engineers including British Gas have been to service the boiler in the last 8-9 years never been an issue ….. so I asked for the failure report, which it should have been loaded to my account,  they refusing to give me any details for the engineer that attend the job not even his gas safety no . I have been in touch with gas safety themselves and I was advised that he shouldn’t have fail the check and should have flag it as advice. It’s been 3 weeks now since and the company failed to send paperwork. Been in touch with citizens advice and Trading standards to look in to this company and have been in touch with BBC so no one have to go through what I’m going through.

We have a 'comprehensive' cover plan with them (appliances, plumbing etc etc) but in the event they cannot fix a fault, they'll eventually force you to accept a derisory Curry's voucher to put towards a replacement. But to make things even worse they won't process that voucher with any urgency, oh no, you have to wait 7-10 days and after repeatably chasing them you get fobbed off with the same stock answer that 'it's with the accounts team' who you cannot possibly speak to. So frustrating. Final Update: After spending a disproportionate amount of my time chasing with multiple calls etc over a 3 1/2 week period, I have finally been sent the £300 Curry's voucher for a £600 appliance. Whilst the time taken to resolve this is not acceptable, or the value you place on my appliance, at least you did send through the voucher so some credit to 247 for that.

The 24/7 boiler service team who eventually had to come out to service my boiler was good, but unfortunately this year I am facing the same issues and it's impossible to get my boiler serviced because they are so incredibly understaffed. I had an appointment for January which was cancelled by them due to illness, then they couldn't provide me with an appointment for a long time saying they haven't got any slots in their calendar? Like for the whole year? I am speachless.I have asked many times to put me on a cancellation list, they called me 20 mins before arrival if I am home.

13/02/2024,01/02/2024,Gas Products,"As a customer of 247 homerescue Gas Company, I've unfortunately encountered numerous issues that have left me deeply dissatisfied with their services. It's important to note that their offices and call center are located in Pakistan, which often leads to significant communication barriers and frustrating experiences.First and foremost, the technical support provided by 247 Gas Company is severely lacking. The representatives seem to have minimal understanding of technical issues, leading to prolonged wait times on the phone and an infuriating game of passing customers from one department to another. It's incredibly frustrating to deal with individuals who cannot provide meaningful assistance or resolve issues in a timely manner.Furthermore, the gas engineers employed by 247 Gas Company appear to be inexperienced and, in some cases, dishonest. Instead of providing genuine solutions, they often attempt to find faults that can be used as leverage to pressure landlords into expensive repairs. This unethical behavior not only damages trust but also creates unnecessary financial burdens for customers.The complaints department is equally disappointing, displaying a complete lack of understanding regarding the concept of ""the customer is always right."" Instead of addressing valid concerns, they seem more inclined to dismiss them, leaving tenants in the cold without proper resolution or compensation.Additionally, despite being marketed as a budget-friendly option, 247 Gas Company's premiums have increased substantially without any justifiable reason. In fact, their prices have surpassed even those of larger, more reputable companies like British Gas. This price hike, coupled with their abysmal service quality, makes them a poor choice for anyone seeking reliable gas services.In conclusion, I strongly advise avoiding 247 Gas Company at all costs. While they may offer cheaper rates initially, the subpar customer service, lack of technical expertise, and questionable business practices make them a truly regrettable choice. Save yourself the headache and invest in a more reputable gas provider that values its customers and delivers on its promises.",LABEL_0,0.574,en,True,True,1.0

He came back later the same day and said we should have a power flush which would cost £599.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with the boiler (or radiators) prior to him undertaking a service so I find it very hard to understand why a power flush is needed  (and he could not guarantee it would solve the problem).  Surely it was something he did to the boiler that made it suddenly not work.  He was constantly on the phone asking more senior engineers what he should do.  Requested second opinion and engineer booked to attend tomorrow.  Got a call weeks before the service pushing for us to have this power flush and then got two further calls on the day of the service recommending this power flush. I wish I had never booked the annual service as there was nothing wrong with the central heating system! Hopefully the new engineer will be able to sort this out.Update: New engineer found that some valves under the sink area had not been turned back on - so problem solved thanks goodness and power flush not required.The response from the admin team was very good when he came to rebooking an engineer so from a communication and customer service point of view, 24/7 has been excellent.

And registered with 247 as a vulnerable person (age).I experienced a problem which caused the sockets fuse on the fusebox to trip, and not reset. I called 247 for help on morning of Friday 9 February and described the symptoms. 247 offered to send out an electrician to have a look at the problem for £95 call out fee. Before the engineer arrived on the Saturday I had worked out by elimination that the problem was in a circuit related to the heating system and so had turned off the related isolating switch, and the rest of the electrics worked again.When the electrician appeared, he said he could not find any faults and that I would need a heating engineer, and left. 10 minutes after he left, I could smell electrical burning around the area where the plumbing electrics were. So I isolated the heating circuit again and called 247 (on the Saturday after I semelled the burning) with more details of the problem, and that a heating engineer was needed, as well as an electrician who would review the problem properly...247 said they needed to collect a £95 call out fee before they would send a plumber, during the next week sometime. I paid again, and explained that I was still without heating... so a plumber and an electrician were booked to attend my property on the following Tuesday.The electrician arrived on Tuesday and identified the problem as a faulty Honeywell 2 port valve for the heating. This valve had been replaced by 247 less than 6 months ago. The heating engineer arrived within an hour later and agreed that the 2 port valve was faulty, and that he would need to report this back to 247 for them to decide what to do.I called 247 on Wednesday and Thursday (yesterday) to ask what was happening with getting the problem resolved and get my heating back on...and was told that they were waiting for engineers reports, and waiting for quotes for repairs.Got a call from 247 today saying that I would need to pay £200+ to get the system drained down to complete the repairs - and I have had to pay upfront before they try to source and engineer .... so 8 days without heat later, I am waiting on an appointment to get repairs completed ... so sometime next week....Spectactularly unimpressed... will not be renewing with 247!From 247...""...24-Hour AvailabilityOur claims helpline is always open.

We initially received no service record, or confirmation of the tasks carried out. We had asked for a system inhibitor to be installed, but again no record of if that task was carried out?Furthermore to this, and the main issue, since the engineer left the house was the boiler not in working condition. Thus, we were left with no heating or hot water, in the midst of winter and a 1 year old in the house also. The engineer was effectively just in a rush to leave the property and did not ensure the boiler was in a working order, which is absolutely scandalous. The boiler was in a working order beforehand and he had just ‘passed’ the service.They did sent another engineer out around 36 hours later and he said it was a loose connector and rectified the issue, however the same issue has returned 2 months later.

22/02/2024,01/02/2024,Gas Products,"I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel compelled to share my recent appalling experience with 24/7 home rescue. After a routine boiler service, they flagged my boiler as ""at risk,"" insisting that I needed an immediate replacement of the heat exchanger due to a broken part. This claim was particularly suspicious, considering they had been servicing my boiler for the past three years without any prior issues.They quoted a staggering £900 for the replacement, despite admitting that the fault would have occurred during their own service. Outraged, I contested their assessment, demanding further investigation. Eventually, after many telephone calls, they begrudgingly sent out the boiler manufacturer for a second opinion, only to discover that the supposedly defective part was perfectly fine.This ordeal exposed not only their incompetence but also their blatant disregard for customer satisfaction. I shudder to think about the vulnerable individuals, like the elderly or those unable to advocate for themselves. They would have needlessly forked out a substantial sum for a repair that wasn't even necessary.The lack of accountability and empathy exhibited by 24/7 boiler service is utterly unacceptable. I implore anyone considering their services to proceed with extreme caution. Trusting them with your boiler maintenance could lead to unnecessary expenses and undue stress. Avoid them at all costs, and spare yourself the headache of dealing with their shocking customer service.Complaint Reference Number: HR1088800",LABEL_1,0.746,en,True,True,1.0

23/02/2024,01/02/2024,Gas Products,"I am seeking guidance as I am experiencing high levels of stress and frustration. I’m not the person who complains but this is getting serious now.In August I have taken landlord home rescue insurance. I have  adviced that as A&e nurse, I may not always be available to promptly respond to phone calls for claims and approvals for my tenant. After the reassurance that  my tenant has been authorised, I have opted for the premium insurance coverage to ensure peace of mind and a smooth process.On January 29th , I had a boiler service. The gas engeneer informed me that he would be turning off the boiler and marking it as risky due to a flu that was not completely sealed on both sides , (there is a gap between the wall and the flue). He explained that this could potentially lead to a CO2 leak back into the property, causing issues. I asked the technician on site if he could repair the necessary work ( that he can issue me an invoice and I will pay for problem to be fixed) and he mentioned that he was not authorized to do so. He advised me to contact the call center, and they would send another engineer to address the issue.On January 30th, I contacted the 24/7 call center and was informed that even this is emergency, my emergency coverage does not cover this work and that a third-party engineer would need to be found, which could take up to two days. After calling again after 2 days I was being told they were still searching for an engineer, I became concerned about enduring three days without hot water and electricity in the cold weather. Consequently, I decided to seek out a private engineer for assistance hoping to fix problem quicker. The call center had no objection and advised me that once the work is completed, I should contact them again so that a qualified engineer can return to the property to service the boiler.Regrettably, I had to travel overseas and my phone's roaming  was not functioning. My tenant have been attempting to communicate with 24/7 , but he was saying that I must speak to them in order to obtain authorization. Consequently, I have sent four emails urgently requesting an emergency visit, as the property still lacks hot water and heating.On February 15th, upon my arrival, I placed a phone call which was subsequently transferred to three different departments. I was given assurance that within 24 hours, an engineer would contact me regarding the appointment details. No one contacted me.On February 16th, 34 hours later, I called again and obtained the job ID. Once more, I was assured that someone would reach out to me within 24 hours. Unfortunately, I wasn’t contacted.On February 17th I contacted the 24/7  and I was informed me  he needs to place it as a new request since there was no record of a previous one.!Additionally, after one week of my written request for portable heaters as outline in my premium policy, he advised me to purchase the heater myself and submit the receipt.Furthermore, I had made a request to be contacted regarding a complaint by either complaint  team or the supervisor.On Monday, February 19th 12:56, I missed a phone call. I called back after just two minutes, and followed the given voicemail instructions. This led me back to the call center and I was given a new date for engeneer appointment on the 22nd. Once again, I was informed that a new request had to be made for a callback.Consequently, on Wednesday, February 21st, I received a phone call, but due to work commitments, I was unable to answer.Therefore, on Thursday the 22nd, I called again and requested a new callback. On the 23rd, in the evening my tenant confirms that engeneer attended, and that he had to cut off the gas pipe to the boiler.So I call 24/7  trying to find out what happened  but I was informed that it was outside of working hours and there was nothing that could be done. I was advised to wait for the report to be reviewed and for a callback.I am growing increasingly desperate and unsure of what steps to take regarding my tenant's living conditions. It is concerning to see them relying on portable heaters and a kettle for their basic needs.I was unable to get my enquiries sorted via 24/7 mobile app as chat bot is automatic and I wasn’t offer to chat with live advisor ; neither I was able to log in new claim request.I acknowledge that I missed two phone calls and I appreciate text messages expressing apologies for the negative experience resulting from the phone calls feedback. Regrettably, this does not resolve the issue with the heating and hot water.Is there any regulatory bodies that could provide guidance in this matter?Thanking you in advance for any guidance ",LABEL_0,0.919,en,True,True,1.0

I could explain all issues that occurred last time but its pointless. Just be be aware of terms and conditions. This company gets you by delaying its service requirements till a few months into your policy. Then when an engineer is sent to service your boiler, it will not be completed because an issue will highlighted which will abort the service. Now you need to pay for the repair which will not be covered by the policy and worse if you cancel the policy you have to pay a big fee. So according to their terms a call out was made and thus you are liable to their huge cancellation fee. In effect your monthly fees paid so far and cancellation fee or repair cost depending upon your choice will be more than your annual policy cost. So its no loss to them either way. But for you there is no service certificate completed and you need to pay for any repairs before your policy is valid.

At the beginning of this winter 2023 my central heating wasn’t coming on and it took me 2 weeks of battle with 24/7 operators to send an engineer in . when the engineer from the Navien boiler did come though his work was spot on and he fixed the problem and we have the heating working really well. However the Navien boiler engineer requested 24/7 for the annual service to be done and again after much struggle I got an appointment a month later in December for it to be cancelled 2 days before the appointment as 24/7 was short staffed. Service still not done February 2024.And now since last Wednesday I am struggling with no hot water from the boiler … I called 24/7 they asked me to call Navien boiler I called Navien boiler they say they won’t come until 24/7 shows them that the service is done.. between the companies internal departments I am still struggling as a customer to get my boiler fixed by 24/7 for hot water.  Appalling level of Customer service. I had to try out a diy of switching the boiler off for 2 days use my parents hot water facilities instead . I switched the boiler back on yesterday Sunday and just about getting lukewarm water to do the washing ups etc… today Monday , still struggling for hot water and still in numerous calls with 24/7 to get this sorted.

27/02/2024,01/02/2024,Gas Products,"Had the most infuriating call with a guy that was not understanding anything I was trying to say, but kept telling me I’m a customer. I had a contract with 24|7 home rescue probably 5 years ago maybe more, but I didn’t renew the contract and I joined British Gas instead. Now since 2018 to 2023 I have not paid a penny to this company, obviously because I am not a customer. However, a month or so ago I get a call from an engineer to say he is outside my house for my boiler service (very dodgy). I told my parents not to answer the door because we haven’t booked anything so my parents literally locked themselves in the house all day. They take a payment out of £39 in January (why do they still have my account details on their system is very dodgy as well). I went to the bank and cancelled the payment and told them it’s fraudulent activity. I received a message this morning saying they have reinstated my direct debit. I called them company, the guy asked me for my policy number ( i don’t have because i’m not a customer). I kept telling him I can provide him proof that no money has been taken out my account, he kept telling me i have been paying. He also said the engineer entered my property for a service, i told him i have camera’s around my house i can provide proof that no engineer entered my house. He kept telling me my contract has been renewed and I have been a customer since 2018. What clearly has seemed to have happened is whoever took my call however many years ago cancelled my payments but didn’t register on their system that i was not a customer anymore. But now reinstated a direct debit payment in January 2024. I asked the guy a simple question ‘if my contract was renewed in October 2023 should I have not be paying every month’ and he said yes. I said to him if he can give me a email address i can provide him with proof of nothing being paid to their account. I had to hang up the phone on him because the solution he gave me was a lower premium price of £22 a month. I have reported this to my bank and would be expecting my refund for January’s payment.

My 1 score wouldn't register. I believe they don't record the customer's rating if they give them a lower review. I tried several times.  When I gave a higher score it was recorded. That's one way of getting good reviews!PS Didn't turn up! Now it's the 1st March.Engineer came no sockets with him. So couldn't do the job.

As it was coming up to the the renewal anyway it had made my mind up that I wasn’t going to renew with them. So I cancelled the policy as it was no longer needed and informed the company by calling them, with the renewal price being expensive also. 4 weeks before the renewal took place, I found better anyway, 5 months down the line this company is still constantly pestering and bombarding me with texts and emails to get me to renew.

The guy told me to turn off at the mains and this seemed to work but said someone would come out.  The system working and making the noise was intermittent and when the engineer came out it was working fine.  I told him the fault was intermittent and told him the fault codes that showed on the boiler.  He hardly looked at the boiler and the pump, said that as it’s working then he couldn’t do anything. This cost me £75 excess.However after he went it stopped again so I called out an independent engineer.  Straight away he diagnosed the fault (even though system was working again when he arrived).  He took off the pump and cleaned it out and the system is now working properly and no noise.Basically it’s cost me £75 excess for nothing.I put a note of complaint on your site and you also said on your reply here that you would get back to me.  I still haven’t heard anything.  Not impressed.Latest 18/3/2024As above I’m still waiting for the reply from your complaints department and a reply to the note I put on your web site More latest 2/4/2024You stated in your reply that you would refer to your complaints team and get back to me.

10/03/2024,01/03/2024,Gas Products,"We have a fault on our Vaillant boiler that says there is a pressure problem (F.75). It will run for an unpredictable amount of time and then raise the fault again.  A reset will start it again. The boiler is pressurised in the correct range (1.7 bar) so I know that can be excluded, which leaves the pressure sensor or a boiler pump fault. Because the problem is not “persistent”, in other words, not technically fully broken down, it is not covered by the policy. I was told that if an engineer was to be sent and the boiler was working on arrival, the engineer would leave and my £75 excess would be forfeited. Understandably, I am not happy and wish I had stayed with Corgi, but they wanted 3x the monthly cost, albeit with no excess. I guess if it was to fail completely I would be covered, but I don’t know if that is going to happen, leaving me with having to reset the boiler at random intervals!!! Looks like I will be finding an engineer I can trust and deciding whether I want to cancel the policy.Update 11th March 2024I tried to trigger the fault while watching the boiler, but only succeeded in getting it into the pressure danger zone of 3.2 bar (the max recommended is 3), at which point I turned it off. Pressure release valve and/or expansion chamber problem? No sign of water being ejected to lower the pressure, which is worrying.After this review went live I had a phone call from the Complaints Resolution team. However, after being passed to the Claims Team yet again I still wasn’t sure if an engineer would come to investigate and fix what is an obvious problem.Now I have escalated the issue.It seems that I have to pay the excess to get an engineer out to investigate and pass on the details of the problem, if one is discovered, which will then be evaluated by the technical team to see if anything will be done under the contract or I pay to get it fixed.Update 12th MarchA local company engineer arrived and diagnosed the problem immediately. He replaced the pressure sensor and filled the empty expansion chamber. No external authorisation needed. Sorted.After all the hassle and days lost trying to get it fixed, I have lost all confidence in 24/7 being able to handle a problem effectively. I will continue to use the local company. So no more answering the same question multiple times on the same call and being told that I said something I hadn’t, and no more explaining why the questions I was being asked made no sense, eg “how many times in a day does the boiler exceed the maximum pressure?”. As I don’t watch the pressure gauge 24/7 how am I supposed to answer that question? As the Call Centre is in India is it that they don’t need or use central heating and really have no idea what they are supposedly supporting? No obvious local technical support backup either.I cancelled the contract.",LABEL_0,0.903,en,True,True,1.0

I spoke to the Habib in customer service who said the order was not placed and would have to start a new claim with me having to pay an excess fee.

13/03/2024,01/03/2024,Gas Products,"Two things. Firstly, our Carbon Monoxide alarm sounded so we called the emergency (not 247) number. They came in 20 mins and confirmed no leak of Co2 but said they were required to cap the meter so the boiler could be checked for leaks.  Fine.  So we called 247 to come and check the boiler and uncap the meter.  They wanted £95 to come, despite our all singing, all dancing contract with them.  Their reason.....in case there was a problem with the gas hob which is not covered by them.  The kind man on the phone even read the small print buried in sub section, sub section, sub section etc. Just an opportunity for them to grab more money so I called a local heating engineer who came for £60.  He discovered issue number two.  On opening the boiler he found it stuffed with paper towels soaking up a tiny water leak.  The very same boiler that had been serviced by 247 in October.  So either their engineer saw and ignored the water leak and stuffed paper towels in or he didn't actually check the boiler. Either way, unacceptable.  There was no gas leak and the water leak is being fixed. Seems like the Co2 monitor was at fault. Clearly you get what you pay for in life. I will be going back to British Gas as soon as possible.Advice:  Have two Co2 monitors so you can verify if one is faulty/at the end of its expected life.

He came as arranged and one of his first statements was to inform me that the boiler was very old and he would quote me for a replacement. As it happens I had already instigated arrangements to replace it. He then proceeded to attempt to light the Pilot light which was successful and said he’d wait for 15 minutes to see if it stayed on. After this time I returned to the room and found that he had removed the boiler from the casing and condemned the boiler as irreparable. For the next hour and a half he brought up the sales spiel on numerous occasions. My concern is was this representative a Salesperson or an Engineer!! and why he dismantled the boiler to find a fault ie a leaking seal. Interesting considering I have a carbon monoxide monitor in the room. I now know the price of a new boiler, interest free credit and when it can be installed ie 2 days. Now left with no C/H or hot water as the new boiler is on the free Government scheme and can’t be fitted for a few weeks.Be very careful of this Organisation.",LABEL_0,0.908,en,True,True,1.0

They could have sent the manufacturer out for £300 to check if the boiler was BER and if so I would get 200 back but lose 100. I said no and soon recieved an email to say my cover was cancelled. Since then the boiler had broken down again so I got a friend who is a gas engineer who told me there was nothing wrong with the parts they stated and it was the control panel and a pump. He advised me to get in touch with worcester as they do a one off payment of £355 so engineer came out and fixed it no problem. Needless to say it's back to British gas.

They only ever came to do a boiler service once a year.. at the cost of £20 to £25 most recently every year. The boiler was making a rumbling sound which the service guy ignored n did not tell me this was potentially dangerous. I lived with this sound for 1 year until recently another guy came to service boiler.. he immediately shut off boiler saying the gas valve was faulty n to contact home rescue to fix. Now comes the joke home rescue do not cover replacement of the valve.. they will change it for me at the cost of £400!! Reason being it is at risk job. Seriously why did I have cover in place I dont no.. their website shows cost to repair valve is £180 to £220.. where does a £400 cost come in.. advisor spoke to manager n cost was brought down within half hour to £304. I am disgusted with this company avoid at all cost as no repair is covered when u need it. People pay u for peace of mind.. I found a company outside who changed the valve in 1 hour for half the price quoted. I will be cancelling my policy with uRef:WS485924 here is my policy number for you to investigate... I am positive you will not do anything and will give me the same 'its in my policy terms n conditions'.

After all the stress resulting  in me having dangerously high blood pressure this company has put myself at 82 and my partner at 85Through so much stress starting  after having a brand new boiler bought and installed by them and then through their electrician making so many problems resulting in having no heating for Five days and told lies that they would come and fix and it took 5 days for it to be done. After the first 12 hours I was offered £30/35 compensation without asking for it. So after five days during the cold month of January I asked for more after a long time they decided I could have £40 compensation. I wasn’t happy.  With the way they dealt with this.  So approx 2 months later I asked to cancel the £15.39 per month I was paying for the cover , taking into account that the boiler had a guarantee of 10 years anyway.  I was told that I had unknowingly signed electronically a 10 year contract, bearing in mind I am 82 and I don’t consider that I could have possibly been explained that this contract was for 10  years.  All the people I have told of this say 10 years. Is so unacceptable and find it hard to believe.I have no paperwork at home to show me this agreement. I have had to get the prove of this signatureThrough on line and as I say at my age I don’t always find on line easy. So when I asked to cancel the agreement They say I need to pay £70.00 per year resulting in £630. In my case . So please beware any new customers of this ridiculous 10 YEAR contract. Especially if you are in your 80s.",LABEL_0,0.669,en,True,True,1.0

29/03/2024,01/03/2024,Gas Products,"Sadly, my experience with this company doesn’t deserve a rating. I have been trying to help an elderly relative deal with this company, without much success unfortunately. The reason for them approaching me to assist them, is that I used to be an Area Manager for a High Street bank, and fortunately my close friend is the former Director for General Insurance at the FCA, so we have a good understanding of both General Insurance regulation and Contract Law, which is relevant to this grievance. To give the reader some background to this case, my relative had a boiler on a rented property that was insured through 247 Home Rescue, the boiler being approximately 19 years old. I believe they had been insured with 24/7 Home Rescue for several years, and had called them out previously to the boiler, so the company were well aware of its age. However, on this occasion (despite the policy document being the same as previous years, and their schedule stating zero excess) they refused to go out to the boiler unless my relative paid £75 up front. Being desperate to have the boiler repaired so the Tennant wasn’t without heat and hot water, she begrudgingly paid the £75, and their engineer appeared. However, he was unable to repair the boiler, pushed for her to have a new boiler, and reported back that the boiler was blocked and required a system flush before a repair could be made etc… It was at this point I was asked to intervene. My relative rang 24/7 Home rescue and authorised them to deal with me going forward. On the 3rd October 2024 after a great deal of discussion a, manager agreed that my relative had been misled, as her policy document incorrectly stated zero excess on the policy schedule (There fault, not the customers). Despite my explaining that this invalidated the policy, and as no works had been completed, they should cancel the policy and fully refund the customer, as the policy was set up incorrectly (their words not mine), therefore under a regulated policy rules invalidating the policy as the customer was misled. However, all they offered was a £75.00 refund, or £75.00 to be deducted from the repair should she wish to proceed down that route. They advised that they would put these two offers in writing to her by email, and she would need to advise them what she wished to proceed with. Sadly, she never received an email with these offers on (Spam box also checked!!). Despite not having received any email, she contacted them again to advise them that she would like to accept the £75 reimbursement as a minimum. Unfortunately, they claimed they had no record of their conversation with myself, and refused to reimburse her anything. Knowing how much time I had spent trying to resolve this for her, she was too embarrassed to tell my that she hadn’t received the £75.00 reimbursement. It wasn’t until I met with her again yesterday, that I asked her if she had been refunded the £75.00 from this company, that she advised me that they denied all knowledge of my call, and was never refunded - Even worse, she was still paying the monthly premium for a product she was mid-sold! To add insult to injury, it would appear she had to get her own heating engineer out to repair the boiler.Upon hearing this, I rang the company yesterday. At first the representative at their call centre denied that they had any of my details in connection with this policy. It wasn’t until I mentioned a GDPR breach that I was transferred to a different person, who miraculously found the authority on file. They initially didn’t find the notes relating to my call from the 3rd October, but after approximately 40 Minutes they did, and kept apologising, as it became clear to them that a manager had previously admitted the policy schedule was wrong, and that manager had agreed to at least reimburse the £75.00 that she was wrongly charged. He then offered to reduce the next two premiums by a further £10.00 per month which I accepted on her behalf (but he now corrected the policy to include a £75.00 excess, which I presume is how this company tries to cover its tracks?) - Won’t work for a pre-existing contract I’m afraid!!This representative (while continuously apologising), said he needed to put me through to yet another department who will process the £75.00 refund. Sadly, this is where the call went further south. The representative didn’t want to simply refund the amount, but wanted proof that she’d repaired the old boiler (Not sure what this has to do with wrongly charging a customer a fee?). After 1 hour, I was cut off 🤷‍♂️  This case is now going to the ombudsman if they don’t fully refund her premiums paid to date, and her £75.00 they agreed. This will now cost them a further £750.00 in a case fee with the FOS, which is what happens when your staff don’t understand the law!",LABEL_0,0.604,en,True,True,1.0

It took 2 days for an engineers appointment and to my dismay they had sent a boiler engineer who confirmed only confirmed our problem. The engineer was pleasant and efficient and managed to rewire the boiler plug so we could use the boiler on another circuit. However my gripe is that the engineer stated that 24 7 would contact us to send an electrician to fix the breaker and restore the boiler plug. After 24 hours I had no contact other than a call from 247 to say the job was fixed and complete and was I happy with the work. On me phoning the claims line again, even though we had the right cover I was informed that our problem was no longer an emergency and that I had to find an electrician myself to repair the fault !

I made it clear to them that this required urgent repair as I had no heating or hot water and water had to be closed off at the mains. And we had elderly in the house with medical condition, this urgency was completely ignored by the team who dealt with my request in a very unprofessional manner. I had to pay an excess of £75 on top of the monthly £26 I was paying them for nearly 9 months. My experience with this company has made me rethink about renewing the policy at next renewal date.

Called at 3pm and was told to expect a call back  'very soon'.  Called again just after 4pm and was asked to send engineers report and that, once received, soemone would call back 'almost immediately'.  Called again around 6pm to be told the report was being reviewed but an engineer would 'certainly be with us that evening'We then endured an awful and cold Scottish night with young children.  i called on the way to work around 6am to be fobbed off with the same excuses.  I was then told as it was 'an overseas call centre' they had no authority to do anything.  This operative couldnt tell me the out of hours hours but advised that my query the day before came 'out of hours'......remember I called at 3pm, 4pm and 6pm?I was 'promised' a call back at 9am.  I received a call (again on a very bad line from overseas) after 9am to be advised that it was not covered by my policy and it would be £95 plus labour!  I have read the T&CS and it clearly states 'Boiler Emergency'.  The SGN engingeer has advised we get the boiler checked in case it has a fault but a boiler policy doesn't cover that?  They said its a 'risk' but if I pay almost £100 plus a few hundred labour that risk apparently doesn't apply?I asked a more senior person to call me back and never got a response. I shall be contacting the Obudsman and urge you to PLEASE avoid this outfit if you have any sense! *They have since contacted me to discuss the situation and it';s went from bad to worse - standard 'copy and paste' emails as responses.

I purchased the product on the basis of emergency same day appointments.After much arguing I’m told an engineer will arrive today. Received a text to confirm and say if I’m not in then I might be liable for a £30 charge. No engineer turned up, no call to advise me. Called them back to be told that the engineer is probably not coming. When I asked why the agent said it might be traffic, a job might of run late as they are busy because of winter. It is Mid April.Clearly didn’t know and not able to speak with the engineer directly. That is the domain of the scheduling team. They will call me back. No timeframe to call me back given. I tried to call back to be told they have now all gone home and back tomorrow at 9:00. Called the next day at 9:30 and they have not arrived. Not to worry though, I am on a priority list. When I ask when they will call me they cannot give a timeframe let alone tell me when I can get an engineer.I asked about escalation and complaints and told to go online.Just left wondering how long this is going to take.

14/04/2024,01/04/2024,Gas Products,"OLDER BOILER? BE VERY WARY OF THIS COMPANY! I have been paying premiums for 5 years to 247 Home Rescue. No claims.  In recent years I got an email to say as my boiler was now over 10 years old, the excess was going up to £75 and premiums were going up 40%.  As I am 65 years old with no family, I thought it was still worth it to be covered in case of emergency.   First claim ever, happened last month.  I had to pay the £75 excess up front, then they sent an engineer out.  He advised it was the pump and would let the office know.  The cost to supply and fit a new pump was £405. I was glad I had insurance.  247 Home Rescue called me later that day and advised my boiler was beyond economic repair and they wouldn't be fixing it.  I asked how they worked this out as it isnt explained in their policy wording.  They said 15 years ago ( the age of my boiler), my boiler would have cost £766 (I have no way to verify this, but possibly?) they don't count installation cost.  With 10% depreciation each year they said it is now worth £156. The repair cost is more than the boiler is worth so they won't pay, or even contribute to the repair.  They won't even send the engineer back to repair it if I pay the £405 in full. Beyond Economic Repair Limit £250? No they won't pay that either.  Value of my boiler £156? No not a chance, theyre not paying anything.They initially refused to pay back the excess charge and simply cancelled my policy! I'm listed as vulnerable on their data base. Goodness knows how they treat people who aren't vulnerable! So 5 years of premiums, £75 excess fee, and they simply said we're not paying anything and your policy is now cancelled.  Oh, but we can sell you a new shiny boiler for £7000 from our sister company.  Conflict of interest, or what?I worked out that even 5 years ago, by their reckoning my boiler was only worth £268.  So inflated premiums and an increased excess charge, really meant they were never going to cover pretty much anything that would require to be supplied and fitted. After 5 escalations (I may be vulnerable, but not stupid), and pointing out wording on their key facts sheet, I eventually got my excess back plus £30 for a small fan heater.  Useless at my property, and I will now have pay for another engineer to come out and do the same tests. This feels very much like a boiler insurance scam to me. So it's off to the Financial Ombudsman to see what they make of these very shady practices. ",LABEL_1,0.738,en,True,True,1.0

The company is a CON. I raised a claim that my sink is blocked and shower is blocked. Their Engineer came and said I dont have the parts to fix we will have to come out again to fix. Then it took over 5 days for 24/7 to come back to me on phone and say its not in terms and conditions. Your pipe work is not correct. It was correct when it was working fine but now when it needs fixing its not correct.The Engineer on site also said your boiler drain is not connected and it leaking in the property which needs fixing. I pay preminum price to 24/7 to fix the issues but its a CON. The guy necr fixed the problem and the kitchen sink and shower is still blocked. Boiler pipe is leaking. I want to take 24/7 to court. I would need the reports from your professioanl (unprofessional) engineer who came to the property with out informing.When i raised a complainet 24/7 have the guts to call me and say we will give you compensation for £30 and our engineer has said the job is complete.Utter lie. The job is incomplete. The Engineer did not unblock the shower. he did try unblocking the sink by exerting pressure in the sink waste which eventually knocked the bioler pipe out of the ""T"" and now that is also drainging in the house. How unprofessioanl the Engineer also left his tools at my house.They are CON and know they are worng and hence trying to fob off by giving compensation. I need my full money to be returned which is in couple of hundreds and not £30.I will for sure cancel with 24/7. British Gas I have had over 15 years at my second house with out any issue or terms and conditions issue like 24/7 has. They just want easy money and not willing to fix the problem.My previous review on 5th April has more details. I would recomend all to think carefully about this company if its easy job they will fix it as its quick in and out which most people can do themselves but if it requires investigation and implmentation they will fob you off and refer you to terms on conditions.BE VERY CAREFUL.

Got a proper electrician in who found the fault and sorted everything on 20 minute charged me £30. Second occassion upped my excess for call out as came up with some story about the boiler being over 12 years old. I built the house its only been built 10 years ago. Came out fixed it and said it was the board that was playing up but said it was only  a temporary fix but it was beyond economical repair and we needed a new boiler. Got the office to give me a call suprise they have an offer on £3000 for a new boiler. Got another gas engineer genuine bloke out didn't charge me a penny said there was nothing wrong with the boiler or the system just get a flush at the next service and call him if we have any further problems but for now it was working fine. Gave me a price.

19/04/2024,01/04/2024,Gas Products,"We were contacted by company to arrange annual boiler service, and the was able to complete same day.Their technician was very polite and appeared competent in his work. UPATE. I initially was pleased and entered a 5 star review.However I have now lowered to 1 star.10 days after the service I noticed that the boiler was over pressurising and expelling loads of water out of the overflow. (Pressure showing at over 4 bar when heating on).I contacted the company to ask for the boiler to be checked again, as it worked fine before being serviced. However I was told I has to now submit a claim for repair as over 7 days has expired. I reluctantly did this and paid the £95 excess.When the second engineer attended he stated we required a new expansion vessel and pressure relief valve. He said he would order the parts and we would be contacted by head office.I later received a call where they stated they would NOT undertake the repair because the cost was £425 and uneconomical due to the age of the boiler, and the only option was to buy a new boiler. I asked them to advise the parts and labour costs, and it was clear they had been over-inflated the repair cost. I have now arranged for a repair by another company at a much lower cost of only £160.This company is clearly selling boiler cover under false pretences, and know they would not honor any claims if the cost exceeds £250. In view of their inflated estimates I bet they don't undertake many repair at all !!!Their conyract small print also states we cannot now cancel the policy without paying fees of £135 for the call out and £85 for the service.

20/04/2024,01/04/2024,Gas Products,"Been a customer for 3 years - service has got worse. Used to be a UK call centre with attentive staff. Now I booked in a boiler service recently and they only offered 2 dates which didn't match what I could do. I asked for alternatives and they placed me on hold for 10 minutes to find alternative dates. They could not offer any day other than a Wednesday for a service and that was over a month.I had a family member come and stay in at my house for the boiler service on the date they gave me as they could not offer any day other than a Wednesday! After they had stayed in all day without an accurate time given for the boiler service they eventually cancelled the appointment at 15:22.  When I tried to rearrange, I was placed on hold for 10 minutes by the call centre worker who was trying to find another date! I hung up as this is unacceptable and this kind of data should be at the operator's fingertips. When I emailed to rearrange a new service, I was offered an alternative date in 6 weeks. Would absolutely not recommend this company.========UPDATE - 1 week later =======Company tried to call me to discuss.  I called back and the person who answered had no record of me calling the company since over a year ago! In spite of the fact the company had been calling me most days since I wrote this TrusPilot review.After explaining what had happened the operator then requested to put me on hold.  After saying I wouldn't be put on hold as every time they did that I was on hold for 10 minutes he agreed very kindly to investigate and call me back.  1 days has passed since and I have received no call back.In my experience, the company has not kept up-to-date records of my account or my personal data. I requested to cancel my contract with them a week ago and still have not had a reply to that email. Just a deluge of phonecalls during the working day when I am unable to answer.   ======= Update 1.5 weeks later =====Company emailed to ask for a convenient time to call. I said after 4pm and gave the number they already have on the system. The company attempted to call me twice before 4pm then sent an email asking me to call them as they were unable to contact me.

I have a scheduled call tomorrow with one of your colleagues to discuss whether to go-ahead and use 24/7. I wanted to find out a little more about your company, service and reputation. As many prospective customers would. I looked on Trustpilot and Google reviews then Facebook.So I had reviewed some '24/7' Facebook posts. In doing so I found a number of posts that had comments on that I could not see. I asked in a couple of these posts why the comments might be hidden (at that point I was assuming they must be negative). I have had another look today and you have either completely removed your presence from Facebook OR you have blocked me. This explains a lot.Needless to say, I won't be using you now.I'd like to think that you have a) an employee who is not representing your values OR b) is doing this with your full company approval. Either way, this is pretty poor.It's not the good reviews that win peoples trust - it's the bad ones (and everyone has bad ones), the ones that show the reader how you treat people when things go wrong.Some of us ALWAYS start with the 1* reviews and work upwards.",LABEL_0,0.933,en,True,True,1.0

25/04/2024,01/04/2024,Gas Products,"Absolutely appalling experience with 247 Home Care. Currently, I have a complaint being handled by the Ombudsman service due to their incompetence.A couple of years ago, I had an engineer service my boiler. Despite mentioning that the boiler pressure dropped every few days, the engineer didn't bother checking any of the radiators and simply dismissed it. As expected, the issue persisted and worsened over time, eventually dropping daily. After paying a £95 excess fee, another engineer replaced the expansion valve, claiming it was the problem. Yet, the very next day, the issue recurred. Shockingly, no radiators were inspected for leaks during either visit.Upon contacting them again, I was informed that they couldn't check anything else as per their terms and conditions, leaving me stranded. Days later, my living room radiator pipe burst, causing a major water leak that flooded one side of the room. This resulted in additional expenses of £160 to an independent plumber to secure and replace the damaged valve, not to mention the water damage to my laminating flooring, which is now uneven.Following my complaint to 247, they callously requested all invoices and pictures of damage, only to then wash their hands of any responsibility, claiming it wasn't their fault.To add insult to injury, amidst this chaos, they went ahead and renewed my policy despite my cancelling my auto renewal, then blamed it on me saying their system showed I renewed it. In summary, opting for 247 Home Care is nothing short of a waste of money. Spare yourself the headache, hassle, and stress by choosing a more reliable company. A few extra pounds spent elsewhere could save you from endless frustration.",LABEL_0,0.873,en,True,True,1.0

26/04/2024,01/04/2024,Gas Products,"Before going into the specifics, I want to say that Richard (the senior engineer who managed to fix the issue with my boiler) was brilliant. Very good, thorough, and managed to sort everything in no time, and if I could rate him personally, I would rate him 5/5Having said that, I am rating 24/7 Home Rescue a 1/5 because I cannot choose 0 stars. The whole management process of my claim was appalling. I opened a claim for leaky (1 yo) boiler with loss of pressure on 8th March. The whole situation was resolved (thanks to Richard, again) on 25th April! 7 weeks in total!In those 7 weeks I had:* 4 different engineers attending my property * Each one had a different diagnosis requiring new spare parts to replace* The lowest point was when I had to live without hot water and heating for a whole week (and partly without electricity/internet for 2 days) because one of the engineers who attempted to fix the boiler ended up completely messing things up AND rip some wires off the walls, hence the no electricity* After being very vocal on the phone, Richard was sent to my property on a Saturday and immediately identified the issue. He also fixed the broken electrics straight away and made sure he ordered the (actual!) spare parts needed to fix my boiler once and for all and came as soon as the parts were available. Not a single time was I taken seriously (would anyone live without hot water and heating, especially when it is effectively cold outside?). In short, I would definitely avoid 24/7 Home Rescue as a company but would 100% recommend Richard as a senior engineer. EDIT: Now that the review is live on TrustPilot, I can also say that I was lied to on the phone earlier. I was told that the review (i.e. the rating) would be exclusively about the engineer who fixed my issue, not 24/7 Home Rescue. I argued on the phone that it didn't seem like it would be the case, if the review were to be published. I was assured multiple times that the review would only be about Richard, who was brilliant (as said above). I am quite glad I didn't trust the person on the phone and maintain my 1 (well, 0) star rating for 24/7 Home Rescue. Now on top of a poor customer experience I can add lies to the long list of unprofessional behaviour. EDIT2: As per the response below, it seems that this has been passed onto the complaints team.

28/04/2024,01/04/2024,Plumbing & Drains,"This is my second negative experience with this company. I reported a leaking tap on their online page. A couple of days later I received an email saying they’d tried to phone me and had no answer so if I still required assistance to phone them. They hadn’t tried to phone me as I had no missed calls on my phone, so that wasn’t true.I phoned them only to be told my leaking tap wasn’t covered. I was a bit baffled as it’s on their drop down menu and isn’t mentioned in the one page of what’s covered and what’s not covered. The operator then without hesitation said it’s in page 7 of the T&Cs. Obviously a page all their operators are familiar with so they have no need to scour the lengthy documentation to find the clause.I’ve now looked at all the documentation I received and there is no mention anywhere that they will not repair a leaking tap. So I would like the company to tell me where that clause is buried?My homecare agreement has a big green tick for all plumbing.Last time they refused to fix a lock on my back door as my conservatory door was considered my back door. I could only see a mention of a porch. I left the operator a 1 out of 5 although it’s not his fault. I later received an email asking why I was unhappy?? Really. No reply yet but I’m not expecting one. Ridiculous that companies say they cover plumbing etc.They’ve even removed my claim from my account so it’s no longer there. I’ll leave my service contract number so the company can show me the clause on page 6 as I can’t find it in anything I have.Well, after telling me they’d look into their policies to make sure my experience with them doesn’t happen again, I have heard nothing whatsoever. No explanation of where this get out of jail clause they quoted is. That’s because I’ve scoured the documents and it’s not there. So they don’t have it.I final bit. I did get my service and on my boiler last time with these guys. I asked the engineer to fill the readings in on my Valliant service book. He didn’t know them as he hadn’t done them, so he made them up!Also, I have a filter attached to the return pipe to the boiler. He hadn’t cleaned that as I had a bit of paint in the seal which wasn’t broken. He’d never touched it.Can I have a reply about all that ? ",LABEL_0,0.926,en,True,True,1.0

30/04/2024,01/04/2024,Gas Products,"Six weeks and boiler still not working properly after numerous visits from engineer(s). Only intermittent hot water and heating until the boiler issues an error code and shuts down. If an engineer orders parts, there is typically a two day wait for the parts to be authorised and arrive and then two or three days before an engineer is booked in, meaning any repair that needs ordered parts is going to take about 5 days even if they manage to guess what the problem is first time. If it needs a second visit that’s another 5 days and so on. Call centre staff are not able to answer any technical questions or complaints, so you have to wait another day for a call back, so the whole process drags on and on. I will update my review if they manage to get the boiler working again. Update: Now trying to cancel the policy and get someone else to look at the boiler but of course 247 are saying I cant end the policy before the 12 months is up and they will charge me if I leave early. Adding insult to injury is the only way I can describe this. I would recommend anyone avoid this company at all costs. Update: After 9 phone calls 247 have agreed to cancel the policy and take no further payments. I still have water leaking from the boiler on to the kitchen worksurface but at least I’m not paying for the privilege.   ",LABEL_0,0.877,en,True,False,0.9

He had to use my hairdryer on it solidly for 30 minutes or so, using up my electricity money...then laid it on thick saying I needed a new boiler as mine was so old and I'm obviously ill and vulnerable so need a working boiler.Within a few hours of the service, boiler stopped working and took 4 days for an engineer to come out. Phone customer service was terrible and unhelpful. In the meantime I had 2 calls trying to sell me a new boiler. When the engineer came to fix it second time he was helpful and friendly, said I didn't need a new boiler, and the problem was a simple thing the first engineer had forgot to do as he left.Very regretful I'd already signed up to another year of their boiler cover as I would have definitely not continued had I known their service, inefficiency, slowness and priority to upsell.",LABEL_0,0.93,en,True,True,1.0

07/05/2024,01/05/2024,Plumbing & Drains,"Dreadful customer service. I have had HUGE problems both times I have tried to use them despite having a Landlord complete house policy including boiler, plumbing and electrics. The first time I had HUGE problems trying to book my boiler service in time for compliance with legislation. Initially they told me that I was calling too early so to try again nearer the time. When I tried nearer the time they tried to give me an appointment which was too late to be compliant. Recently I had problems with booking an emergency plumber. They could not immediately get through to the managing agents so tried to leave a message on an unrelated mobile. They eventually managed to get through to my tenant but then failed to book an appointment and left a potentially problematic water leak for a whole bank holiday weekend. I was eventually informed via my Managing Agent that the supplier had failed to go ahead as they needed to speak to the policy holder- however the supplier had not at any time tried to contact the policy holder and I ended up having to call them. This was due to the excess on my policy which needed to be paid first/upfront. If the policy holder had not been contactable (e.g. abroad etc) then the plumbing fix would not have proceeded as the supplier refuses to invoice for this excess fee and wants immediate payment before any job takes place. This is even despite the problems I explained to their customer service team regarding booking any appointment.Further Update (8/5/24) Despite having reported all the problems that I am having messages that should go to tenant regarding timing of plumbers visit still being sent to landlord's mobile when this is not appropriate/required as these should be sent to the tenant instead. Also as the landlady after the plumber's visit I phoned up 24/7 to obtain a report as to how the plumbers visit had gone and whether the issue was now fixed. Unfortunately 24/7 customer service were unable to advise me. It was important for me to know quite quickly as I am having a new washing machine delivered. I did explain this to the representative but they did not seem at all interested in my dilemma.",LABEL_0,0.895,en,True,True,1.0

The engineer didn't Service the boiler, only checked the gas emissions.  He was here for 20 minutes at the most.  The boiler broke down and they told me they wanted ove £360 to repair as the gas control valve needed replacing.  This was even though it was under contract and they had been taking money off me every month (boiler was 11 years old) I refused and got a reputable company in who cheked it over and it wasn't the gas control valve. It was broken because they hadn't Serviced it properly. Servicing should take at lease an hour.

When they claimed to have fixed it through some form of telepathic plumbing and your water pressure crashes, then that’s not linked and they want an additional £90 call out fee, then when the original fault recurs 4 weeks later, that’s another £90 call out. When you complain and refuse to pay the £40 cancellation fee, you get Stanley. Stanley is head of complaints for the company so he must be extremely busy. He did take time out of his hectic schedule to answer my complaint and offered to reduce the fee from £40 to £30, Stanley said this was his final offer, Stanley is currently singing for his £30. 😂",LABEL_1,0.82,en,True,False,0.9

16/05/2024,01/05/2024,Gas Products,"During 2023 an engineer attended at my property to service the boiler.  This engineer broke a clip holding the inside boiler cover to the boiler itself.  The engineer confirmed to me that he had broken the clip at the time (0.27p each).  24/7 then tried to charge me for this breakage at £109.00 for the engineer to attend back at the property to fix it.  When I queried this 24/7 contacted the engineer who initially admitted to me that he had broken the clip and he also admitted to 24/7 that he had broken the clip.  The clip was replaced free of charge and in this engineer's report it was confirmed that both clips were intact - 24/7 confirmed this to me during my complaint.  Then in 2024 a different engineer attended at the property, admitted he too had broken a clip, the black plastic remnants were on the floor and he told me he had ordered a new clip.  After he left my property, the control panel of the boiler dropped down as this engineer had not screwed it in properly (he told me he could not find his blue screwdriver).  I heard nothing from 24/7 so phoned up and explained what had happened and made a complaint when I was told again, I would have to pay £109.00 to replace the clip (which costs 0.27p) which held the internal boiler cover in place which 24/7 said had caused the control panel to slip and as the clip was not covered in the policy, as the engineer had confirmed that he had not broken it but confirmed to them that it was missing when he arrived at my property on his report, I would need to pay £109.00.  I confirmed that the engineer had indeed broken the clip as I had swept up the evidence.  The complaint was looked into but as the 24/7 engineer had reported that the clip had been missing, which was untrue, the complaint was not upheld so I asked for a manager call back.  This was received and I explained that if the clip had been missing previously, then the boiler cover would have shown signs of this as the cover would not have been on.  The complaint manager refused to accept this or accept that the engineer's report from 2023 confirmed both clips were on the boiler.  I confirmed that no-one had been in the boiler since the last engineer serviced it during 2023 and if the clip had dropped down from the boiler then it would still be within the boxed-in boiler compartment, and it was not.  The complaint was not upheld again and the complaints manager, who totally refused to give me his manager's name etc, told me I would have to pay for a further engineer visit of £109.00. I explained that if the clip was not on the boiler from 2023 then the engineer who attended the property at that time would not have been able to attach the internal boiler cover at that time.  When the boiler was serviced in 2023 there were no signs on the boiler that a clip was missing and no signs that the clip was missing when the engineer attended during 2024.  WOMEN WHO ARE ON THEIR OWN - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY - the engineer during 2024 said 'I hope I am going to get a thank you when I have finished' - creepy or what!   DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AS IT WILL COST YOU IN THE LONG RUN AND IT COSTS YOU TO GET OUT OF THE CONTRACT.  BE VERY WISE AND GIVE THIS COMPANY A TOTAL MISS. TOTALLY UNSCRUPULOUS COMPANY AND UNSAFE FOR WOMEN TO USE. 247 replied to this complaint very weakly, stating the 2024 engineer's report said the 'clip was missing"", however, the engineer's report from 2023 confirmed that '2 clips were present at that time on the internal boiler cover. So which engineer lied?  No one but the engineer ever goes in the boiler built in cupboard.  Martin Lewis' website has a dossier on 247 and the reviews are dire.  As I said previously, DO NOT USE 247, you will end up paying the price.  Martin Lewis' website is full of complaints about 247 with many dissatisfied customers.  ",LABEL_0,0.678,en,True,True,1.0

We were told boiler irrepairable , or under their policy they were claiming would cost more than £250 to repair so not worth it. I also had to pay a fee for call out as boiler was over 10 yrs old. Something like £75. Very very quick to get out a very overpriced quote for a new boiler. Cancelled our cover and went elsewhere calling in an independent gas fitter. Came today carried out a full service drained off so much gunk commented that boiler hadn't been serviced properly for many years.

The service was carried out by Wayne, an exceptionally skilled and professional service engineer.From the moment Wayne arrived, his friendly demeanor and punctuality set a positive tone for the entire service. He demonstrated an impressive depth of knowledge about boiler systems, patiently answering all my questions and explaining the process in clear terms.Wayne's meticulous attention to detail was evident as he conducted a thorough inspection and maintenance of the boiler. He ensured that every component was functioning optimally, and he even went the extra mile to provide helpful tips for maintaining the boiler's efficiency.What stood out most was Wayne's commitment to safety and quality. He performed all the necessary checks with precision and ensured that everything was left clean and tidy after the service. His professionalism and dedication to his work gave me great confidence in the reliability of 24x7 Home Rescue.Overall, the boiler service provided by Wayne was top-notch, and I highly recommend 24x7 Home Rescue for their excellent service and expertise.

I immediately called the 24/7 helpline at 10 PM, and the customer service representative assured me that they would notify me as soon as an engineer was assigned to address the issue today (30/5).However, by 11:30 AM today, I had still not received any update. I called the helpline again, and the customer service representative kindly followed up on the status of the repair. Regrettably, I was informed that the earliest available timeslot to fix my boiler was on Monday (3/6) - a full 5 days after the initial breakdown.I am shocked and dismayed by this unacceptable delay. I should not have to wait nearly a week to have my boiler repaired, especially given that my whole family left without hot water for the entire duration. This is a wholly unsatisfactory level of service, and I had expected a much more prompt and efficient response from 247.I sincerely hope that the company will review its procedures and resource allocation to ensure that customers experiencing urgent issues can have their problems resolved in a timely manner.

14/06/2024,01/06/2024,Gas Products,"Please be wary of the positives reviews. This is LONG! Unfortunately I fall under the “should be no star” reviews. I called today - 14.06.24 at 11:03. This was after trying to use the App which is rubbish, but now rather telling of this company as they are the same.  I tried to use the chat - luckily I got the number I needed from them of whom to contact. So… I put my heating on last night and on switching it off -E1 code came up. I topped up the pressure. Now the boiler is 11 years old but is still functioning. Today when I woke up at 6 am, I noticed the boiler pressure had dropped again to E1 and has since done x3 times in the space of 3 hours (after being topped up each time). My partner noticed the carpet in the hall was soaked and we noticed a leak from the radiator. We have made an attempt to turn off but there is water is dripping out and it is next to an electrical point. We have pulled back the carpet and underlay and the floor was soaked. We dried it off and have a dehumidifier set up.  This is relevant because once I managed to get through to someone at 24/7 I explained all this to them. They advised they could arrange a call out and that it would be a £95 call out fee. I accepted, paid and then got told that someone would be out tomorrow on 15.06.24 between 10-18:00 with a 30min call beforehand. I advised this was not suitable and what I was told,  as I would class this an an emergency - it’s an uncontainable leak!!! Plus the employee on the phone never indicated that it would be the next day on the call. The phone went silent and then there was a dead tone. I called back and got advised that 24/7 had no engineers available. Sorry - they do have engineers in the area but they are full. The also advised their policy is 24hours! So I explained they have until 11:03 on the 15.06.24 then! They couldn’t care less. I wouldn’t trust them to empty a bath let alone run one. I advised I would have to call a plumber as this is an emergency. They just kept sticking to to the “24 hour policy” jargon. I told them this pointless conversation was cutting into my time to get a plumber so they should cancel the call out and refund the payment. I was told this refund would be between 5-7 days. I ended the call and I found an emergency plumber which is now going to cost me over £200 for a call out but they will be here before 4pm today. During that call I noticed I had three voicemails from 247 - all very difficult to understand due to the background noice, but I did make out they wanted me to call back and confirm if I wanted the call to be cancelled and refunded. I called back and the person I spoke with said it had been cancelled and the refund would be 7-10 days! 3 people at 24/7 and it wasn’t sorted.  At this point - I wouldn’t trust them with being able to tell the difference between a bath and a shower! I pay £14.95 a month for this and now I am out of pocket and I have had zero service provided for.  24/7 rescue????? More like “how do you spell rescue”! Shocking company. And I better get refunded! I can’t want to not have to be with this company anymore. I may add that my per month amount went from £6.95 per month to £14.95 the next year and I didn’t get a service in my first year as they have no availability so the they didn’t provide the boiler check in the first year. And a little nod to 24/7 - no, before you ask… i won’t provide my policy number here as it goes against GDPR as I’m pretty sure you “won’t be able to find my details”…. Your gold standard response.

Was quoted to pay an extra £325 to fix a problem to which you think it would be covered by the breakdown cover I pay for monthly. Shocking customer service I was told to either pay or find someone else to fix the problem. I will not be renewing.

18/06/2024,01/06/2024,Home Electrical,"I was hesitant to post this review initially, but eventually posted as you might find some thoughts in here useful. I’m letting a few properties and have had an emergency cover contract with 247 for around 5 years, covering all let and my own property. During these5 years there have been 3 emergency cases altogether and 247 didn’t provide any emergency support with either: Saniflo systems aren’t covered (even in case of emergency), leaks must be visible and accessible (now I know track and trace excluded, but why don’t you state this in bold when advertising your peace of mind?), toilet blockages aren’t emergencies as long as there is another toilet in the building (regardless of the number of inhabitants), etc. The small print takes care of minimizing 247’s headache. Ultimately, now having gone through all of this – buying the emergency cover won’t provide you with so heavily promoted “peace of mind” whatsoever, instead, you acquire a lottery ticket with limited chances of getting help, ending up with even more hassle. Last case: electrics tripping across the ground floor, no domestic hot water, no shower, no fridge, food went off, plus the risk of fire (which was subsequently confirmed upon examination of one of the sockets). 247 couldn’t bring an electrician the day of logging the request, advised the tenant to expect an electrician next day 9am-7pm. Despite minors staying in the house. By 2 pm next day still no electrician and no updates. Long story short, given the risk of fire, the tenant arranged an electrician through myBuilder platform who turned up 30 mins after the call and did the job within 2 hours.Conclusion: 247 are just a middleman happily taking your money. No peace of mind, good looking on paper but in reality - very limited support with extremely poor turnaround time. I will not prolong my contracts with 247, or any other emergency company, instead, all the money saved will go into a savings bank account forming an “emergency fund”. If anything - myBuilder guys are always there and don’t hide behind the small print. This is the real peace of mind.PS: just read a nearly identical Trustpilot post, where a customer complained of 247's electrician not considering their electrics tripping as emergency. In their polite response 247 reassured this wouldn't happen again, what an irony 247. Very sad...",LABEL_0,0.819,en,True,True,1.0

06/07/2024,01/07/2024,Gas Products,"I spent weeks looking for boiler home care provider that would be conducive to my Mother & myself, as we both have disabilities. I was with SES but, their services were taken over by Home Serve. I had a few issues with Home Serve customer services which I felt couldn’t be resolved & mainly, because the renewal contract price, which was extremely unaffordable for my Mother. I did take out a contract with a company called Your Repair but, I cancelled within a few days. They were not able to provide a service that would accommodate the disability needs for my Mother & myself. I then came across 24/7 Home Rescue & I had seen some excellent recommendations from Moneycheck & Heatingforce.I had also read about 24/7 Home Rescue & various reviews on Trust Pilot. I felt quite confident that I had found the right boiler home care provider. Whilst I was applying online to signup to 24/7 Home Rescue, I got a phone call from one of their customer service representatives, whose name is Ajmal. He had seen my online application & that I had used a promotional discount code. He said he could offer me a better offer.Ajmal was very polite & friendly & listened attentively to the problems that I had experienced with other providers. He was very empathetic towards the disability needs of my Mother & myself but, more concerned about by my Mother’s chronic multiple health issues. She is currently 87 years old & I am also her carer.Ajmal was so courteous & professional at his job & explained everything to me very clearly. He was so kind & patient & I felt that he understood my circumstances & what I was looking for. He provided me with an excellent monthly payment, saving me over £30 compared to my previous providers. After I had setup a new boiler contract with 24/7 Home Rescue, I received another phonecall from call from Ajmal, confirming that he had received all the necessary documents that he needed & confirming that a hard copy of my boiler care contract, would be sent by post, which I have received.I like to thank other customer care representatives who had also called me a few days ago, just to make sure that my Mother & I were happy with everything & I said that we were extremely happy. I can truly recommend 24/7 Home Rescue as a boiler care service provider & for the outstanding customer care that they had provided me.   Thank you ",LABEL_0,0.901,en,True,True,1.0

We got insurance for our boiler just to make sure we were covered incase it stopped working or we had any issues. Our boiler started playing up and the hot water wasn't working so we reached out to them.When you contact them they tell you it can take 48 hours to find an engineer to visit the property so all you can do is wait. An engineer visited the property the next day and found the problem in 10 minutes but could not fix it (even though it was a small and easy job) because he needed to go back to the company to get permission for the work. Another 24 hours have passed and we still haven't had the work approved and its still being reviewed. It's now been 3 days without hot water and we are simply told to wait even though this is classed as an emergency not having hot water. We pay £20 a month for this cover but its a complete waste of money! Do not even consider using this company because they are completely USELESS. We will be cancelling our contract ASAP and finding another provider even if we have to pay more.

This company is utterly clueless and could not care less about its customers. 24/7 could not be a more inappropriate name.I took my complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service on Jan. 2 and their service has been exemplary and a far cry from what we received from 24/7.On Wed. July 3 the FOS emailed me to tell me that they had completed their investigation and upheld my complaint. They instructed 24/7 to refund my excess and pay me an additional goodwill payment for all the inconvenience. On Thursday July 4 24/7 emailed me asking for my bank details. I replied the same day and the £ was in my account first thing Monday morning. 24/7 never did anything so quickly before.What pleases me as much as the settlement is the fact that 24/7’s handling of my complaint and the appalling way they handled it is all on the FOS records as well as Trust Pilot’s.The only reason I have rated 24/7 as 1 star  is solely because there is no star that is lower. I would have rated 24/7 as ZERO if that had been possible. Their customer service and care it non-existent.On Nov. 27 last year our 6 year old boiler broke down and it took until Dec. 27 before the problems were fixed. We were without hot water and central heating for 4.5 weeks and Christmas and Boxing Day were cancelled.In those 4.5 weeks we received 4 visits from 24/7’s appointed boiler engineering company and 3 from the boiler manufacturer. The latter  had to come 3 times due to the incompetence of the former and their last 2 visits I had to organise myself as 24/7 did nothing about it.1 	I hate to think how much time I wasted on phone calls and emails to 24/7 in those 4.5 weeks with endless hours waiting to speak to someone.2	It was impossible to speak to the same member of 24/7’s staff each time I phoned and that meant going through all the details every time I rang.3 	7 visits by engineers to fix a boiler only 6 years old is ludicrous and it was only due to the boiler manufacturer's engineers that the boiler was finally fixed on Dec. 27.4 	On Jan. 2 I sent a comprehensive diary on a day by day basis of everything that had happened in those 4.5 weeks to the FOS and the FOS never had to ask me for any more information.5	Prior to 4 above 24/7 had offered to reimburse my excess. I countered that saying that I would accept that if they paid for the new pump as a gesture of goodwill. They refused - hence my approach to the FOS.6 	24/7’s Ts and Cs indicate that they will offer customers in our situation portable heaters. The offer was never ever  forthcoming.The paragraph below is taken from reviews on TP  and is another 1 star only. It very aptly sums up their utter incompetence and ""could not care less attitude"". This is a “bog standard “ 24/7 reply to more than one 1 star only dissatisfied customer. 24/7 could not have summed up its busines acumen more accuraletly if it had tried. Talk about “shooting yourself in the foot”. What a bullseye that 24/7 cannot find the detailsl on their system!Reply from 247 Home Rescue4 days agoHi,We are sorry for this poor experience.

Despite paying for their 24/7 call-out service for this year as a cheaper alternative to British Gas, I encountered significant issues when I needed urgent assistance, I guess you get what you pay for, lesson learnt. After an engineer did his annual service, he advised me the PCB had blown, although it was serviceable before his visit. With no heating or hot water, I tried reaching out to them through various channels, but to no avail. The lack of responsiveness and absence of an apology left me frustrated and disappointed.When my boiler was serviced, it was found to be faulty. I expected the repairs to be covered under my policy, but I was informed that certain parts were not included, and it was not economic to repair, which meant a new boiler. This misalignment between what was promised and the actual coverage was disheartening.I strongly advise potential customers to carefully consider their options before choosing 24/7 Boiler Care. While some positive reviews exist, my personal experience has left me questioning the value of their service.There communication is non existent and I feel completely ripped off.

18/07/2024,01/07/2024,Gas Products,Update - I have now found out how 247 were never going to repair the boiler by using the term beyond economical repair. They gave a well below price of my boiler brand new and then stated it reduces in value by 10% each year. The insurance policy was therefore pointless and they need to provide much clearer information. If you have to claim good luck. Made a recent claim. Fully relaxed that the 247 insurance policy would cover the boiler defect. How wrong was I? We ended up paying the full repair price to 247 of £329 as well as the £75 excess.If your boiler is not brand new then pay a bit more and go with an honest repair company that doesn't harass you with the new boiler team and try to charge you £3000+. Also don't listen to these salespeople that harass you - they will say anything to try and get you to buy the new boiler (I'm hoping my recent calls are all recorded for the follow up complaint).,LABEL_1,0.716,en,True,True,1.0

I have been with them for the last 2 yrs and had no problems until they done last service and identified a 'risk' which didn't exist before whilst I was with them and quoted £336 repair costs. They said I am not covered for this as per t&Cs but the fault occurred whist i was covered and I didn't exist a year ago when last service was carriedout. They said its at risk of breaking but not broken enough to fix it but they issued a service noticed to say not safe to use but safe enough not to repair.. I would say its all good to pay for 'cover' and think you are covered until something breaks down. I would afford and go with a reputible business instead. My Account reference is ms581022.

Since the service, the radiators now automatically turning on whenever I switch on the hot water. This issue went unnoticed for eight days, during which time it resulted in unnecessary heating and increased energy bills.When I contacted customer service to address this problem, I was met with confusion and a lack of understanding. They repeatedly questioned how servicing the boiler could affect the radiators, despite my clear explanation of the changes that occurred immediately after the service. Not only did they fail to provide a solution, but they also refused to acknowledge that the issue was caused by the recent servicing.Overall, I'm extremely disappointed with the service and the customer support provided.

Tomorrow came went and 6 phone calls later they said we did not receive my email. That is after they had confirmed they had. Two days later I am still chasing them as after locating my email they said the leak is not too visible on the pictures. Shocking company.

I’ve been a long-time customer of British Gas and HomeServe, and there's simply no comparison between them and this company. Trustpilot reviews may not reflect the true experience. This company asks for 5-star feedback after a pleasant conversation, but that’s before you actually need to make a claim or request a repair.Compared to industry standards set by companies like British Gas, this company falls short. While I’ve had my frustrations with British Gas, 24/7 Home Rescue is an outright nightmare. My tenant experienced a leak, and while British Gas had no issues with handling repairs directly, 24/7 Home Rescue created endless obstacles. They don't allow tenants to arrange repairs directly, dragging out the process to the point where my tenant was left stranded while I was on holiday.In contrast, British Gas once promptly repaired a leak under the bath without any fuss. But with 24/7 Home Rescue, they insisted we identify the source of the leak ourselves, asking us to open panels and send them videos. How are tenants or students supposed to do that, especially when the landlord lives two hours away? After endless discussions and phone calls, they never even showed up.When I requested a refund for the 10-11 months we had already paid, they flatly refused. Consider yourself lucky if you see this review and avoid this company at all costs. This nightmare happened 10 months ago, and I’m still appalled by their service.",LABEL_0,0.861,en,True,False,0.9

14/08/2024,01/08/2024,Plumbing & Drains,"This company needs to rethink its whole philosophy and what they stand for, and have stated they can do for customers. It's all a complete fabrication. No great customer services. Can't understand most of them as they have staff not in UK!! cheap staff payroll I guess!.. and if you complain they don't listen, and have pre written decisions which tell you that you'll never win or get your money's worth, OR A FAIR DECISION, and then they want to charge you large amounts of money for the whole year worth if you ask to leave because you are not impressed or happy with their poor shoddy treatment. I wish I'd stayed with British Gas Home Care. Guys!... cheaper is not always better. Lesson!They say they cannot move a 'close to the wall' toilet in order to stop the water from constantly flushing. They sent 3 different 'engineers' to my house - and then each time they state that you have to wait in ALL DAY 8-6pm for them to visit (Even British Gas have sorted themselves out and will give you a window of when they will call... who has time to wait in all day for a silly engineer, when we are all so busy?) and if you miss the appointment they will charge you £30 for the pleasure!!. The 1st man just came and wandered around my house and didn't even attempt to flush the toilet to see why it was leaking. He reported the job was 'COMPLETE'! The 2nd man was much better and he said in his report that the TOILET NEEDS TO BE MOVED FORWARD to get to the rubber washer behind to sort out the issue.... SO THE COMPANY KNEW THIS .. so why did they then insist on sending another man a few days later to 'LOOK' at my toilet... He then said that the toilet needs to be moved forward to get the washer... 24/7 said he shouldn't do this - even though he was a qualified plumber and had all the tools and replacement parts in his van and the experience to do this. THEN  THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME £93 so they could move the toilet forwards. TALK ABOUT A SCAMMMMMM!!! THEY 'UPSELL' their services and things that should have been inclusive in getting the job done in such a shocking barefaced manner.BUYER BEWARE. I am a real life customer and I am tied into this company for the next 10 months and I won't be using them ... but they will still get my money by direct debit MONTHLY.Hey 24/7 NOT SO home care. I am really disappointed in your sales and your customer services. You sold me a damp squib. I need to be allowed to leave your company with NO false charges as you are not going to do my work, and will probably blacklist me as I have spoken out. But the truth needs to be told - so other vulnerable customers don't lose their hard earned cash coming to you. I've been a British Gas Home Care customer for many years, but thought cheaper was better. DON'T DO IT. its not better. Go direct to British Gas Homecare .. all the other startups are simply fakes and cant even live up to their standards with better staff and better customer services as BGH. I need the truth to be told. They have trumped up that i said this and that just to validate their refusal to let me leave and to refuse my complaint. So I have used my voice here to warn other customers of the issues Ive been left to deal with at the hands of this company. I BET IM NOT THE ONLY ONE TO SPEAK OUT WITH THIS COMPANY. But we know we can get 'great' reviews!!!Your response that the complaints dept. will get back to me... They already did. That's why I had to voice my honest and open review on here...This is what they said... 'We therefore are unable to waive your cancellation fee of £140 and maintain our position to repair your toilet if you are happy to pay for your toilet removal in the sum of £96.Please note that, under terms of our Complaints Procedure, this is our final response.'Its your final response...

20/08/2024,01/08/2024,Appliance Cover,"50 years plus as a customer of British Gas I was surprised on Sunday to receive my annual service renewal document which showed an increase of circa 30%. I phoned to see if there had been a mistake, but to no avail, apparently whilst I thought that I had not made use of the repair facility for 3 years, during the last routine service lubrication of a hive switch (less than a minute) constituted a callout. So sadly I cancelled the product.I searched the internet for a new provider at 77 years of age I was fearful that I had made a hasty decision however the price being asked left me no alternative. I need not of worried as I soon found Home Rescue, their site clearly set out a comparison with many other providers. Further documents clearly explained what was and what was not included in the package. So spoke over the telephone with a very friendly agent who was both knowledgeable, professional and above all humanistic. After answering some simple questions I signed up for home heating and kitchen appliance cover and was pleased to be offered a further 10% discount on the quoted price. (The welcome letter and terms and condition document arrived immediately by email as promised) So I end up paying less than currently let alone the 30% increase requested by BG. With the set up service offered by Home Rescue all my fears have been put to rest. So far seems a very professional organization, so as a pensioner (entered on their priority service schedule without any prompt from me) I have peace of mind for another year.

I waited in hope that the engineer would arrive but at 11:30 24/7 messaged to say the service would now happen between 12-18:00 so again I wait and wait.

He shouted to say all done, I noticed the boiler was leaking water he said it was excess from his work ( no attempt to clean it ) he then left. My service record book was saturated in water and now ruined. The boiler was buzzing and smelt of burning. Within an hour the boiler was totally dead. Called to complain, call centre was awful and now Im told I have to wait another 24 hours for a call back. YOU WOULD NEVER have this awful service from British Gas you certainly get what you pay for. Uodate: you called me today to confirm my complaint and said someone would call to arrange a return visit of an engineer a a priority - no call received but had text to say to call you, I called on the number provided the person who took the call had no record of anything - I suggested they found out and called me back.

There was a person called Hamza who is incompetent, takes very long to understand and respond to the most basic queries. Customer service is in some offshore location. He even called me at 7am in the morning. They should at least know to be mindful of the timezone of the country they work for. I asked them for a complaints process. They don't have a proper response to that. The technician said the valve for hot water is gone and needs replacement. He said he was putting that on his notes. As it turns out he lied to my face and his report apparently says he has fixed the problem. He did a manual override just as a temporary solution so we have hot water. That's no way to fix an issue. Now 247 want me to raise another request and charge me another call out fee. I have spent hours explaining to mindless people why it's not acceptable, but to no avail. And this has been ongoing for over a week now. In their policy they say they will deal with issues arising from visits withiin 14 days for free.

An electrician attributed it to our Boiler.On Monday, we asked for help from 24/7, our insurer, paid £75 for a boiler engineer call-out. He was absolutely useless and confirmed there was a problem of “reverse polarity”and added this to his call sheet.He then said that we need another engineer! We paid another £45 for an engineer for a callout, but he opted to call us on FaceTime to view the Boiler. He then said he would call the Insurer to request a Plumber for us on Saturday but we have never received the call? A further call to company today, Saturday, confirmed no action before Monday, and another charge of £45. I am now arranging for a private Valiant technician to call. As far as 24/7 are concerned, a letter regarding a claim or legal action is my next .  I Would not recommend this company because some of their staff work from home/office and there is background noise. We are pensioners aged 82 and have had no hot water or shower facilities since Sunday 25 August, and have to carry a kettle of hot water upstairs, when needed! We are also both DISABLED!Today, Wednesday, we were asked to call you the claims line. The first person I spoke with could offer us a service in October and there would be another charge. We rejected this offer. Later we received another call and this time an engineer will be coming to our home for a service on Wednesday.Very pleased to say that 24/7 pulled out all the STOPS on Tuesday by sending us a professional engineer who quickly identified three problems requiring replacements. The boiler was then written off and we received vouchers for £495 towards a new boiler if  provided by 24/7. The company are also going to refund the £75 and £45 charges.

31/08/2024,01/08/2024,Gas Products,"Unfortunately I have to write a negative review. My boiler was working fine until the engineer came to do the annual service last week. I have been with 247 for a while now and they have always been really good up until this point. The following morning I woke up to all the radiators being on full blast upstairs even though the heating was turned off. I double checked the thermostat and my cosy system and hoped it was just a blip. The following morning the same thing happened. I called the service centre as I have a service plan. The same engineer came out and said I needed a diverter valve. I received a call from 247 to say that I needed to pay £95 excess plus £108 for a system drain down. As you can imagine I was not happy as everything had been fine before the service. I then asked my partner to have a quick look. The electric motor for the diverter valve had been removed and once this was put in place everything was working well again. I complained and said I wanted to cancel my policy as I have absolutely no faith in the company. They carried out a service and left it not working properly. They said if I wanted to cancel the policy I would have to pay £84!  I am not happy about this as their service, which caused the issue, could have cost me over £200 for something that did not need doing. ",LABEL_0,0.794,en,True,True,1.0

04/09/2024,01/09/2024,Gas Products,"Until my renewal date I would have gave a higher rating but this is definitely the worse company I have had to deal with when it comes to a renewal. Firstly they tried to hike my monthly payment to £16.47 from £5.49, I know this is common practice but in the renewal email it stated ""If you have an increase, this may be due to a claim you made or because your cover may include a boiler which is now older than the age thresholds of 6 or 11 years, when boilers often need more repairs"" my problem is my boiler is 2 years old and I have never claimed, the only service i have used was a boiler service which is included.So because of this I ring them to cancel as I can get the same cover for around £6-£7. I speak to a man for a few mins and he tells me he can drop the cover to £12.99, I politely refuse and ask to cancel. He then puts me on hold to speak to his supervisor. When he comes back he tells me he can drop it to £10.99, I politely refuse and ask to cancel to which he puts me on hold again then comes back and says he can drop it to £8.99. at this point I'm getting a little annoyed and telling him I'm finding it hard to stay polite because you are not listening to me, I just wanted to cancel the damn thing. He says ok I will proceed with the cancellation and puts me on hold again. He comes back and says my supervisor has said I can drop the cover to £7.99 but the cover won't be as comprehensive. At this point I'm pretty annoyed and I get a bit more annoyed with him. I tell him to cancel it and he says ok I will proceed with the cancellation and puts me on hold again. He comes back and says that he's about to cancel but his supervisor has said he can drop it to £7.99 for the same cover. I told him that if he would have offered me this in the first place I probably would have said yes to save me having to switch covers but after all this Im definitely cancelling. I was pretty annoyed when I said this so he finally cancelled. This process to around 30mins when it should have took 5. My advise would be don't be drawn in by there low price for the first year as they will hike it more than 200% for the second year and make it really hard for you to leave. As you can see by my review they did not need to hike it that high but they do it hoping you will just take it. Just another Extortionate insurance company. ",LABEL_0,0.916,en,True,True,1.0

Numerous phone calls to the hotline to try and arrange an appointment, missed visits asking tenants to wait in all day. Being lied to over the phone about the reported issues and when the engineers finally did arrive diagnosing the issue they didnt report it back to the office so the whole process started again. Save your money for when the break downs that do happen and arrange a trusted tradesman. First registered the issue at our property on the 14/05/2024 the matter was finally resolved on the 09/08/2024. Imagine the time spent over almost 3 months to try and resolve this issue. “24/7 home rescue” is nothing more than a brand name.When we cancelled the membership due to poor service we still had to pay a number of months to remove ourselves from the contract. Even then its not worth the hassle of trying to arrange an appointment and request a refund with this tragic company.

They are called 24/7 Home Rescue but what is not made clear is that it is the call centre and online logging that is 24/7 but they can take up to 48 hours to arrange an appointment. I had an electrical problem very early on a Sunday morning and I had no working electrical sockets in my house. I logged the call on line. Two hours later I called the company and was told they are trying to get an engineer to me. Two hours later I called again as by now my phone was losing charge, I had no means of cooking or boiling a kettle. I am an elderly widow who lives on her own. I was never asked if  I had means of heating, cooking etc. I was told 'it is a Sunday you know' and they would not be able to get an engineer out. I organised my own electrician that day who resolved the fault. I complained to the company about the service and received a very condescending email reply saying that they could have offered me an appointment for the Tuesday but I had already resolved the issue. I would have been without any electrical appliances for 2.5 days at that point. I was offered a refund of one months premium but this offer was withdrawn when I said I wanted to cancel my policy.  I can understand that emergencies have to be prioritised but I was left with no electrical appliances, no landline phone (as linked to the broadband) and a flat battery on my mobile phone.

The boiler had been fitted by a Corgi registered heating engineer and serviced regularly for 6 years. As soon as the engineers left the boiler stopped working. I noticed that the water sensor had been removed and left on the washing machine. We were left without heating and water for two days and had to get another heating engineer out to fix the boiler that had been broken by 24/7 'engineers'.

13/09/2024,01/09/2024,Gas Products,Do not ever use this company. We never had any issues with our previous boiler. A repair to the flue was recommended and as our boiler was getting on we were advised it would be best to put this towards a new boiler. Stupidly we listened to their advice.They did not inspect our pipe work properly and fit a boiler where we have consistently been left without heating and hot water over the last year. Forced us to spend £599 on a power flush we didn’t need; although later refunded when they admitted they were wrong. Won’t put the correct pipe work in place. Now state we have to be left without heating and hot water until our bathroom is completed despite the same error code occurring as before we started this work. They could not even tell us they wouldn’t be attending until I called them to chase this up. Still waiting for a call back from a manager to make a complaint. We have had 11 visits this year alone which has impacted our work as we had to take time off. We just want a working boiler but don’t think they will ever be able to supply this to us. We will be taking this complaint to the finance company and the Financial Ombudsman to try and get our money back so we can get a boiler fitted by someone who knows what they are doing. ,LABEL_0,0.912,en,True,True,1.0

My advice to all the people who are thinking of changing their boiler, do not go with this company. You will get shafted. If they sell you a so called ‘NEW’ boiler which was manufactured 10 years  ago. I am sure you will get a measly £195 if your boiler breaks down in 2 years.

20/09/2024,01/09/2024,Gas Products,This company is a scam. Do NOT be roped in by the low price.They offer an absolutely poor service. They are never available 24/7 to respond to an home emergency. Call them numerous times this year and every time it has taken a week to send someone. If you have a home emergency a one week response time is no good or use. You can source a local person in that time framework.They call themselves 24/7 as they answer your call 24/7 but can not respond to a home emergency.You are better off paying British Gas a few extra pounds and in exchange you will at least get home emergency cover.They have one Gas Safe / Plumber covering the whole of the Southwest from Cornwall up to Gloucester that is why they can not respond to your call out.All their call agents are from abroad (Pakistan) so it is hard to understand them. The company is based in Burnley and they may have many engineers up North but nothing South.Sign up to this company at your Peril.

22/09/2024,01/09/2024,Gas Products,"Was with this company for 3 years. I gave a 5-star review last year mostly because of the amazing engineer the company sent to service my boiler. Fast forward a year later, boiler service due and carried out. Different calibre of engineer; not as personable or capable/competent as the young lad sent last year due to the fact that after the service, my boiler started making these awful, scary noises mostly when the heating was turned on. We didn’t catch on at first because we didn’t use the heating immediately after service so the first time I noticed was about 9-10 days after the service. I managed to contact them after it had occurred a handful of times (I am also a professional who works full-time, and travels a fair bit and it took another 3/4 days to get around to calling them -once the issue had occurred multiple times). I was told I was outside the 7-day window to report faults after a service. However, no one had reminded me of this at the point of booking said service, engineer hadn’t given me this information immediately after service and I didn’t receive my service paperwork after service (although even when I got it, there wasn’t a reminder on there to contact them if  any problems within a week) so they effectively had breached their own T&Cs. If any or all of these had happened, we’d have run the heating immediately a handful of times to make sure everything was fine after the service. Anyway, they refused to send an engineer out and their defence was that the contract (which I’d entered into some 6 months prior) gave that information about the 7-day window. Thus, their ridiculous expectation is for the customer to have a photographic memory and to have memorised every line of the policy (bearing in mind this wasn’t emphasized verbally at any point) so I was expected to have remembered or even been aware of the 7-day window from looking at pages of T&Cs 6 months prior to the service). I tried to argue that this was an unrealistic expectation and that the customer should get a reminder at the time of booking a service/engineer should mention after service, and then ppw received immediately after  should also highlight this. They refused to send an engineer back out, instead advising they’d give me a ‘discount’ and charge me £65 for a visit. My boiler had been working absolutely fine before service, no complaints throughout the life of the policy, and hadn’t expressed any concerns about it prior to service. We’re also a vulnerable household. But instead of coming out to check what their engineer had done to my boiler, they used the get-out-of-jail-free card of policy T&Cs. We also discovered that whatever he’d done or not done correctly, messed with the thermostats somehow.  I went to the Financial Ombudsman which is effectively now a toothless bulldog, and the outcome was that they couldn’t speak to what had happened with, and after the service, but the policy said blah blah blah. Needless to say, I have now cancelled my policy. Whilst I was going back and forth with 247, I had to get a qualified mate to check my boiler, to at least give me peace of mind that it wasn’t about to explode any minute, considering the awful racket it was making after the so-called service. So, buyer beware. ",LABEL_0,0.87,en,True,True,1.0

They came out and did a first service and from the time the engineer attended and left, the boiler started to act up and the pressure would keep going up and my hot water cut out.  A few days after the engineer left, I called to say I was having issues with the boiler and that the settings weren't working and they said they would send someone out but this never happened.  I rang them twice about this and the first time they said they called and didn't get me (there was no missed calls on my phone). Second time they said it would be a new claim and I would have to pay a call out fee but finally agreed to send someone out after I told them this was still the claim after their engineer had come out.  To date no one came out for that concern.  My boiler subsequently started leaking and I called them and had to pay a £95 call out fee only to be told they needed to strip down the boiler to fix it and I had to pay another £150 as this was not covered in my plan with them.  I did this, they came after much back and forth.  I was out of the country and left someone at the property to give them access and called and provided them with the contact information for the individual, but I kept being called and messaged when I was away trying to bury my family member.  When they finally decided to come out, they were telling me between 8 and 6pm which was utterly unacceptable as some of us do work. They finally agreed to between 8 - 12pm, then on the day they should attend, twice on the day they cancelled the engineers, first saying the engineer was sick and then that the other engineer had an emergency.  Buckets of water were being emptied and they were telling me they couldn't send  anyone out for two further days. It was only after I asked for the matter to be escalated that I was able to get them to come out.....all of this whilst abroad, as they continued to ring me and message throughout, even though I kept telling them to ring the number for the person at the house.  The engineer who finally came out claimed he messaged me an hour before he was due to get to the property but I never got that text.  He looked at the boiler and decided it would cost £500 to repair (which they didn't cover of course) and recommended that I get a new boiler.  They then quoted for a new boiler but could only offer one brand which they were obviously working with.  I advised I would like a choice of brands, but was told they can offer nothing if not the brand they were touting.They are in my view dishonest and misrepresent what they offer, whilst trying to upsell you things when they come out to service your boiler. I now feel like they tampered with my boiler to get me to buy a new one. My boiler was being serviced every year since purchasing it and prior to them attending to do their service, I had never had any issues with it, having put it in new 8 years before.  I would never recommend 24/7 to even my worst enemy.",LABEL_0,0.927,en,True,True,1.0
23/09/2024,01/09/2024,Gas Products,"I have been a loyal customer of 24/7 for over 7 years, paying a monthly premium for their Home Care Plus Package. Every year I got a boiler service as part of the package, but never called them out for anything else. However, last week my hot water wasn't working due to low pressure. An engineer attended my property, part of the package,  and fixed the issue within seconds. Miraculously when he looked at his next job, he surprisingly stated that its my house and due for an annual service. This is where it all cam tumbling down. He came out with a list of things that were needed service the boiler, at an additional cost of £328.00, not covered by my premium cover policy. He also stated that if they open up the boiler, there could be other issue and could cost an additional £800 on top (£1,228.00) in total. I was shocked, given I was paying a premium for their most prestigious package for years and they would not fix my boiler, as it doesn't cover the parts or labour cost. I then suggested, in that case I have new bolier cover with 24/7 which they put me to a tea of sales people, that stated the cover is not for a new boiler but £400 towards a new one. I asked for the cost an they were trying to push me into an unheard of model costing 4 times more, even with the £400 discount than any other company ( i received several quotes). With all this I asked to CANCEL the policy as I thought it was absurd they were ripping me off as a loyal customer. Im then told it will cost £289.00 to cancel the policy as I had a annual service, which was part of the policy. Ultimately, I paid a premium for years, to be ripped of and when I want to leave they continue to request more money. Their customer service team is based in India and they say many things that are not true to keep your business. REMEMBER, you are paying a monthly premium which is contractual under their T&Cs they don't tell you about, and practically everything that will go wrong with a boiler or heating is not covered. You will pay more! AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",LABEL_0,0.762,en,True,True,1.0

24/09/2024,01/09/2024,Gas Products,"Been with 24/7 Home Energy for 4 years for boiler cover. This year the price increased by 47% on auto renew with little more than a small line hidden in one of the many emails they sent. This is the second time they have done this.Despite me being with them for 4 years, my premium was double what new customers are offered (and I got less service cover). I called to cancel, at which point they said they hike prices up and lower them back down for those who phone to cancel. Offered to do the same for me but I refused given how toxic this tactic was. They then charged me £30 for the ""privilege"" of cancelling the contract, which they had auto renewed.In terms of service. It always took months go get an engineers appointment, and then they gave whole day appointments, meaning a full day off work. Once a pressure meter was faulty, engineer said he would call back as a quick 5 mins to replace - never heard anything back. Keep clear!",LABEL_0,0.916,en,True,True,1.0

Anyway engineer came out (lovely guy by the way) told me the issue and then said I'm not covered so he left and I ended up getting a local plumber in to fix it as I knew these company's would charge alot more... I then tried to get my 95 refunded as the work wasn't fixed.. I messaged and emailed 3 times no reply.. so rang today to be told it's none refundable!! Why??? I'm paying that to fix my boiler which wasn't fixed so that's my money! And not forgetting you have scammed me paying me £35 extra if it was supposedly a call out fee!

Also, no one has come to your door either, so you’re left thinking maybe the engineer is still on their way and that was the 30min warning?! 15mins go by, still no reply from txt’s, or now multiple phone messages to the random no! You also can’t get through to the main office! When you finally do get to speak with an agent, they won’t help me!!

Or perhaps is lost, and can’t find your address?! NOPE, after 3 calls with different agents NO ONE would help me! Still no one has come to my front door either?! I end up having to get my internationally based Landlord to call this company, who was then told apparently the driver waited for 25mins then left?! WHEN?! WHERE?! Why didn’t they answer their phone, call meback, or the basic call out engineer method of ACTUALLY KNOCKING ON THE FRONT DOOR?!!!lMy landlord has now had to reschedule the appointment to the next day, and pay an another fee!!

04/10/2024,01/10/2024,Gas Products,"We have had cover with this company since 2020 without incident. In 2022 we had a new boiler installed by Bosch. The boiler was serviced the next Summer 2023 by this company.  The engineer that serviced the boiler was lovely and very chatty, at the end of the service she told that everything was fine and there were no issues. Last week the second boiler service was carried out, this time the engineer advised that the hinges on the front panel were broken, this was a shock as this panel had not been touched since the service the prior year during the boiler service.When he was done the bottom left side of the front panel had slipped and you could see a visible gap, he said that it needs to be repaired asap as this could compromise the function of the boiler. He also told me that if you're not familiar with this brand of boiler and don't take care when removing the panel, you will snap the hinges. I received a call from customer service the next day, they were providing a quote to repair the hinges it was going to cost us £129! I questioned this and was told that the previous engineer had noted the broken hinges in her report, funny she never mentioned this to me and I never received a follow up call to have this rectified, which is what I thought the boiler service was for;  find and fix any faults, otherwise what are we paying for? Outrageous! Because they use contractors any damage caused when servicing a boiler would be a chargeback to the engineer, which is why she didn't mention it to me and made it seem that this was the way she found it. In the end we contacted Bosch and they arranged to have the hinges replaced. Needless to say I've cancelled this cover as I can't tust the integrity of their contractors. We will be paying more for Bosch to carry out the annual service, but at least we will have peace of mind.",LABEL_0,0.869,en,True,True,1.0

Went to check the boiler and water was leaking everywhere inside and through the outside pipes. 6 hours this had gone on for since the engineer visited! So within a 5 minute visit this said engineer had damaged my boiler causing a massive leak, and he decided to leave without saying anything other than he's ordered a new part!

Now left without heating or hot water with young children and a baby in the house. Told I have to wait 24hours for the issue to be picked up and then I'll get a phone call back.

I was told by a customer service advisor this was down to the fact they do not cover my type of boiler. This is In spite of the fact they serviced it the previous year and also knew the make and model before letting me renew my policy and letting me book my service. Eventually this was resolved and rearranged for a date a week later only for the exact same thing to happen.

Only once on both properties I have called them out and the lazy engineer on his phone the whole time at the property could not find where to turn off the water. Then said he can’t go up into the loft without me getting it boarded up and when I said I will go up he then decided to go up there to turn off the water. Then he left the property as soon as I left the property he left informing my tenant he can’t fix the boiler pump. I paid £75 call out fee and another £220.

12/10/2024,01/10/2024,Gas Products,"247 Home Scam should be the real name of the company. So this is how it works:1. You call boiler not working. Engineer (so called) turns up 5 minutes later without opening the cover tells the unspecting tenant major works needed company will be in touch.2. You get a call from the company new boiler sales team, very very concerned your boiler is beyond economic repair because thier engineer has condemmed the boiler due to extensive parts needed to be changed & the boiler being substandard and old. Its a Main(Baxi) boiler and 8 years old! so you ask how much is it well for you just around 2400 pounds.3. You refuse they cancel your cover, I asked for a copy of the engineers report which has this on it ""premier sensor resistance was very low 3.5kom, also they advised that the PCB was faulty and required replacement. ""4.Flumexed how he could have gaterd all this information without opening the panel & Baxi advised all this without any being on site I called Baxi! I am aure you can guess what they said... no call received regarding my boiler serial number and there is no way they could have diagosed this or nay one could have without being on site and no one knows what this premier sensor is on thier boiler.5. Stumped and out of options I ask them how much will they charge for a repair £443.00 is the figure that came back with! fair does to them the lady said you could pay this over 12 months and the boiler will be covered for the 12 months too, they wanted the last engineers report so they could make sure they had the parts on the van, so that is when I had called you the customer services and they said we can also het the manufacturer out for  a repair at he cost of some 265 pounds, never offered this before! only a boiler replacement! 6. Had already paid the Baxi guys and they had confirmed they will turn up the next day so kept them on. They did turn up the next day first thing in the morning and lo and behold there was nothing wrong with the boiler except the timer on the boiler was off no PCB no fictitious  premier sensor.... nothing at all. 7. Fuming that I had been had and almost fell prey to 24/7 high pressure sales tactics I wrote an email to their complaint team wanting to know how does a boiler with a timer switched off get diagnosed as beyond economic repair... and my policy terminated because I didn't accept their new boiler.. Their complaints department wouldn't take any names  on a public forum came back with a 20 pound compensation as a good will gesture and I am £443 down. Needless to state I will be filing a complaint with the financial ombudsman today. 8. They had done the same thing on another property of mine a week before as they filed its CP12 on routine seals which British Gas & Main both have confirmed are service items and must be changed on service inspection, lo and behold I get a call from their new boiler team stating your perfectly operational Valliant Boiler needs replacing as its too old and seals are failing!!!!! What worries me  how many people has fallen victim to these scamsters.... any one who has please speak out, so others especially the old  don't fall victim to the unscrupulous methods of this company.

So my husband rang up - because we thought there must be a fault on the website - and he was told that, yes, all appointments were booked for the next year.  Not much point in having a policy that includes a service if there's no one to carry it out.  The person on the helpdesk said they would 'phone us when an appointment became available.  After two weeks and no 'phone call, my husband 'phoned again and was told ""We can send someone today.""  Yes please!  Several hours later they rang to say ""The engineer can't do today but he can come some time tomorrow.""  We had made plans for the day but, since it's important to get the boiler serviced before the cold weather sets in, we stayed in all day, waiting for the engineer - who didn't come.  My husband tried ringing the company but, clearly, there's no one on the boiler service helpdesk at the weekend, because when he pressed the button suggested he just got a recorded message saying the engineer would ring half and hour before he arrived.

Despite initially signing up to a contract that was very competitive, the service thus far has been far from satisfactory. Despite joining in December of last year, the first date available for the mandatory service was August of this year. This was then cancelled by the company due to “unforeseen circumstances” with 48h notice, with the first available rescheduled date being October. Today, after staying in all day and receiving a text that an engineer would arrive between 1pm and 6pm, we received a text saying that due to “unforeseen circumstances” the engineer could no longer attend🤬 If we were to cancel an appointment we could be hit with a £35 penalty.

Premium was very cheap but I'm now giving up on it.Ihave a flat where the pipes are behind walls or under floors.I had a leak in the bathroom which was showing up on the floor. To get to the leak the plumber would have needed to access the pipe through the wall. This is turned out was not covered in the policy. The leak must be visible for it to be repaired. The relevent clause says no investigation or access is inlucded. As far as I am concerend this makes the claim to cover plumbing worthless as in most cases the source of the leak is not visible as most pipes are behind walls (unless your home is the Pompidou Centre).

21/10/2024,01/10/2024,Gas Products,"This scam& dodgy company has broken my healthy boiler and has very very poor serviceAvoid this dodgy company.Read my review carefully& I tell you how they play dirty&break your healthy boiler to be able to sell you a new boiler& steal your money.You pay them around £200-250 annually for their landlord care plan.Then you call them multiple times to arrange for a boiler annual service&landlord gas safety certificate.My tenants didn't have any issues with the boiler at all before the engineer's visit&it was working perfectly.The tenant took a day off work&stayed home between 8am-6pm.Their staff who are based in India and Pakistan call you 2-3 times on the same day before the engineer's visit&push you to sell you a new boiler&if you decline it then they try to sell you their company products like descaler, inhibitors etc.When you decline their products again then engineer won't turn up for the appointment on the day&waste your time&money.Then you arrange another appointment&engineer attend the 2nd appointment after weeks if you are lucky then he told us the boiler is faulty &needs to be repaired but he tells you "" IT IS NOT COVERED BY YOUR POLICY"" & you have to pay extra in spite of having no issues with the boiler at all! I made a huge mistake& trusted them and I paid £210&the engineer falsely claims he fixed the boiler but no Landlord Safety Certificate or no other repair report was given to me by the engineer or by 24/7.Then, my tenants experienced issues with the hot water the day after the repair.Then hot water stopped completely a week after repair!!! I complained to them straight away then they ask me to pay £95 to book an engineer appointment to fix their fault. They are an absolute joke and very dodgy. My tenants took a day off again&stayed home again 8am-6pm but engineer didn't turn up again for 2nd time in 2 wks.My tenants&I are very disappointed&very frustrated with this fake and scam company. My tenants took 2 days off work but the engineers didn't show up twice and wasted my tenants time and money. I complained to them&cancelled my all policies immediately&they offered me only £25 which is an absolute joke!While they took around £500 from me&created a fake job&didn't do anything and broke my healthy boiler.I have spoken to different staffs multiple times who are based mainly in India&Pakistan&Eastern Europe& requested full refund of £210 as there was no issues with boiler before the engineer's visit.The engineer are unprofessional, incompetent& useless &they took advantage of our trust&made up a fake job&damaged the healthy boiler. My tenants lost money and time because they stayed home twice but the engineer didn't turn up twice.It's very unprofessional company with very poor service which only takes money every month but when you desperately need them, they don't care about you at all. Don't get fooled with their reviews, I don't believe it at all. If customers miss the appointment then customers have to pay £30 penalty each time, however the engineer failed to attend twice while my tenants stayed home the whole day and they didn't offer us any money. Their customer service is absolutely rubbish and you have to call them many times and chase them and they keep you waiting for over 15 min with no luck to solve your problem. Now, I have called 2 different boiler engineers from different companies and they checked the boiler and they informed me the previous engineer has broken the boiler and it cost around £1000 to fix it or better to buy a new boiler. The tenant didn't have any issues at all with the boiler before the visit by 24/7 engineer and he deliberately has broken the healthy boiler and I am absolutely disgusted. So, please be aware of this scam company with incompetent and fake engineers. I cancelled my other policies with them and I advise you to cancel your policies straight away and save you time and money. But if you decide to keep the policy, make sure, you stand next to the engineer when he visit your boiler. And if he tells you the boiler is faulty or at risk etc, don't believe him and don't trust him at all and get a second opinion from a different engineer from a different company.

They contact you when a gas service engineer is in the area, so no 'jumping through hoops' etc as you would have to with some of the major companies when you want them to provide what you pay for. So far, this has meant that my boiler has been serviced at more frequent than every 12 months, which is a positive and a bonus indeed. Thomas, the service appliance engineer who attended, lives locally and is very friendly and gave positive reassurances about the condition of my boiler, instilling me with confidence about it's reliability over the coming winter months. Their monthly charges are also only about half of what I would pay with the likes of British Gas.

Well not if you're in an area that they don't cover and they sub contract to... they don't do weekends. Appalling. Also they don't tell you this when you take the cover out. And you have to pay the up front £45 callout charge before they then tell you noone available until Monday .... and they still don't confirm a callout! We made a claim at 8.30am on a Saturday morning. After paying the £45 excess they offer Monday. I ask for a refund .. then I'm told they will try their hardest to get a callout before then (elderly lady living on her own with no hot water nor heating) ... so I think ok I'll give them a chance.

I'm like ""what on earth am I paying insurance for? 😳They then send quotes for replacing boiler for £3000. The next email I get from 247 home rescue is them informing me they have cancelled my insurance policy with them, stating that the boiler is too old and BER (they knew the age of it yet happily took the monthly premium prior to this for years) as they had cancelled the insurance policy, I contacted my bank and cancelled the direct debit, that was on the 28/10/24Two days later, I receive an email and text message from them regarding me cancelling the direct debit, the message states ""to avoid cancellation fee being charged, we have reinstated your direct debit and policy"" WTF!

02/11/2024,01/11/2024,Gas Products,"Complaint - Home Rescue 247 - 1st Nov 2024  Please forward this complaint to the CEO of Home Rescue 247. My wife and I are both in their 70s, with a severely bed-bound disabled daughter, whom we care for.  For our peace of mind, we took out a Home Rescue Plus 247 plan to receive the highest level of cover for our Worcester Bosch – Greenstar – 440CDi Boiler and any Plumbing issues. I am a new customer of Home Rescue 247 I had to call an engineer out to deal with our central heating system and a water leak on the central heating pipe. The engineer arrived late on Friday afternoon on the 1st Nov. He stated that we don’t cover Worcester Bosch – Greenstar – 440CDi Boiler and as such I can’t touch the system. Furthermore, I cannot repair the water leak as it would involve him opening up floorboards on the landing and he is not allowed to do this. I said I find this strange as where would one expect the pipework to be located in the house other than some running beneath the floorboards? He said to take it up with the company. It came across to me that the engineer did not want to do the work as it was late Friday afternoon. I became frustrated and extremely disappointed but did not wish to argue with him. He has left us in the lurch without any consideration for our predicament. I have found Home Rescue to be dishonest in offering the cover they promised, and as such I strongly advise and recommend that people look for an alternative trustworthy supplier.  I am an extremely disheartened customer. Nobody from Home Rescue 247 has got back to me to discuss the matter.I hope to receive an appropriate compensation.Thank you.M I Essa (Retired Magistrate)Bolton",LABEL_0,0.849,en,True,True,1.0

02/11/2024,01/11/2024,Gas Products,"This company uses very dubious hard sell techniques. When their engineer arrived to do my annual service he immediately told me I needed a new boiler and showed me a few small nodules on the heat exchanger saying that’s about to go and you need a new boiler. This set alarm bells going so I took pictures and sent them to gas fitter friend. His assessment was that there was no imminent danger of the boiler breaking down. But if there was a problem with the heat exchanger Worcester Bosh would replace it if the boiler was under ten years old and charge only for labour. If 247 were reputable they should have known this and advised me accordingly. Within half an hour of the engineer leaving I received a call from the 247 salesman offering to quote me for a new boiler which I declined.Because the 247 engineer had worried me I contacted the manufacturer Worcester Bosh who sent their own engineer a few days later.On taking the cover off the boiler the Worcester Bosh engineer described what I had been told by the 247 engineer as “Nonsense”He declined to change the heat exchanger as it didn’t need replacing. He carried out a full service and pointed out several parts of the service which had not been done by  247. When I mentioned this to 247 they replied that they only do a visual check. Does this actually constitute a service??So cutting the story short , 247 said they had acted correctly and  it was my decision to accept their advice or not.  I believe it was just a blatant attempt to sell me a boiler I didn’t need.

I questioned if this was genuine and was told it was, obviously a scammed would say that,but I was also checking information from the site and the fact that the location of the number which rang me was same as registered office and an email I received convinced me to carry on.The advisor was really nice and totally understanding to my issues. The fact this is being done by DD gives me the chance to cancel should anything look dodgy.Overall they give good service and price and also having used this company before helped. Just wish they just let you continue with your application without instantly calling you as it does give you doubts even though they were giving me a better price from the good price already I would have preferred to complete things myself.

Did not even take the front off the boiler to see inside. I called this compsny- who passed me from ine department to snother- all of who only wanted  to convince me to extend my policy. It was a big fight to disconnect from them. Eventually- it took a stressfull 1/2 hour insisting I want to leave them  - just to stop them sucking my money every  month - - for nothing. I was happily boiker insured by Homecare for years- great service & helpfull office staff- never any problems & certainly no stress - unlike this 24/7 outfit. I have learned my lesson- dont change companies if the one youve been with was good. -& warn as many people as possible about the waste of money nightmare called 24/7 home care.

If your not a morning person then DONT do any jobs in the morning. He was rude and frankley no help at all. I then rang the desk today advising as my policy includes drainage the engineer should have cleaned it out. Instead the engineer quoted, he isnt going to clean out other people dirt out of the pipes. I need to request for someone to do it. VERY DISAPPOINTED and disgusted with the lack of professionalism. The team on the phone were also no help and said I have to get someone independently to do it. Why am I paying monthly when these people reject to help EVERYTIME I request for a issue to be resolved.

The engineer came and genuinely seemed to have zero clue about boilers. I was absolutely sure that the fault must have occurred when the service took place, but the engineer (by the use of Google) decided the fault was due to the main circuit board and left, leaving me with no heating or hot water.I was then contacted by their call centre to inform me that ‘my boiler was uneconomical to repair, but they’d offer me £200 off a boiler replacement’I asked to escalate the issue as I had a fully operational boiler before their engineer came and I had a boiler that had been deemed unrepairable’I was called by a ‘supervisor’ who was from an off shore call centre and genuinely seemed completely disinterested in the fact that 247 had broken my boiler.I was advised by 247 that if I wasn’t happy with their response I should organise my own plumber, which I did.Long story short, the 247 engineer had increased the pressure too high. The local plumber came, reduced the pressure and it cost me £20.How on earth this company can treat people like this is beyond me. To break my boiler and the condemn it to get me to buy a new boiler should be criminal.Interesting that when you call their new customer department you get their UK based call centre. When you’re trying to discuss a complaint they’re happy for you to discuss with someone who’s second language is English and has absolutely no influence or interest in customer service or satisfaction.I can’t be the only person who’s had this?

When they sent someone for an annual maintenance, the person just came to check and see if everything is working as the boiler is only 3 yrs old, and he spent 3 minutes and left.The first time I called for assistance, they wanted me to pay them £95 when they didn’t even know what is wrong with it. That is absolute nonsense because if there was an excess to pay, it has to be when they have to buy parts because I have been paying them every month, and when they renewed this month without my consent, it’s gone up from £14 to 18 a month, so why should I pay £95 as if I’m calling some random person to come to my home???. I know I should have read this but I didn’t because I took the  policy on the phone and the person took over 40 minutes to explain BUT NEVER MENTIONED ANY EXCESS OF £95. He only told me the good side; up to £1000 on parts when I call for assistance. That is when someone should pay an excess towards the parts. If they don’t need to buy parts but just restarting, or something that I can’t do, WHY SHOULD I PAY AN EXCESS AS IF THEY DONT COLLECT MONEY EVERY MONTH FROM ME? I have cancelled the direct debit and when they called me, I have asked them to cancel it. I got a cheaper one from my bank, which customers pay the rest of the money when the parts they have to order is more than £300 because of the monthly payments of £18.99, and that includes mobile phones repairs, car roadside assistance and travel insurance.  As if they own my bank account, they have sent me an email this morning that they will reinstate my direct debit otherwise they will charge me a cancellation fee, but they renewed the policy without informing me only this month, and I will go to the financial ombudsman if they try to frustrate me after collecting my money for over a year without doing anything for me.I called a random person who charged me £75 and brought the pressure up, and even taught me how to do it by myself next time. This is what they wanted me to pay £95 although they didn’t know what was wrong with the boiler.The sensible thing 24/7 could do is to charge that £95 when they have to order parts because it could be a low pressure, which I couldn’t bring it up,  or something that doesn’t need parts.

11/11/2024,01/11/2024,Gas Products,"Terrible service overall, I have an issue with my central heating/boiler which has only occurred after my annual service. The call centre didn’t understand my issue and sent out a plumber (who which I may add was great and very apologetic when he arrived and discovered he couldn’t do a job). I’ve tried calling to get an issue resolved and still no further forward. This is all after they have doubled my renewal policy after the first year. I’ve looked at my claims on the app (which is terrible) and they have marked all my claims as completed even though nothing has been done. *Update MS626364Update 14/11/24To no surprise I’ve still had zero contact from this company about my issue, this is after speaking to the head engineer on the phone and emailing videos with my issue which has been ignored even after emailing to ensure he had received the emails.

There was a repair fee of £99, but the ongoing cost thereafter of £24 pm, made this very good value for money. The best part is that there is no 30 day exclusion period, with this particular policy, which is brilliant. The engineer who attended, was super friendly and manged to temporarily get me back up and running and requested authorisation for replacement parts, which was granted the following day.

The reason for the prompt call becomes apparant - they stated the Boiler was beyond economical repair. Because my Boiler was 9 Years old they added depreciation so valued it at £350, the cost of the repair was £390.  I asked if I could pay the extra £40, they refused.  They then offered me a new Boiler at £2900 but they would contribute £400 - I declined and asked for the £400 or at least the write off value (£350) they declined.This is all in your Terms and Conditions, I should have read them, granted, but surely when I took out the Policy this should have been highlighted as you won't get many repairs for under £400 in the current climate.Never again - awful Company, use D&G or Homeserve - they are Fantastic!",LABEL_1,0.804,en,True,True,1.0

I had unfortunate dealings with them on multiple occasions and my summary of the company is- BARELY ANYTHING is covered in the terms. Like for plumbing, draining the system is not covered. Most central heating jobs require a draining system which means we have to pay £135, for toilets replacing some part would mean moving the toilet for which they charge £145 (and no they won't agree to us using the builders to move the toilet)- They use engineers who don't know much about what they are doing. Multiple occasions their engineers conflicted the previous one.- Customer service doesn't follow instructions- to resolve something would require many many calls as teams don't talk and engineer don't follow up.- engineers due to lack of knowledge will make things worse and then blame it on you.- engineers will find a way to make sure it's not covered. They fixed one thing but messed another and blame my system.- engineer would blame previous engineer from the same company for wrong quote and for ordering wrong partsMy boiler had a pressure issue which meant changing expansion vessel.

20/11/2024,01/11/2024,Gas Products,"Absolutely terrible service. I have held a policy since 2023 on a new boiler. A condition of the boilers warranty is that it is serviced annually, to this end I had the boiler serviced by 24/7 on 09/02/2023. In turn the next annual service needed to be completed February 2024, however every time I made an attempt to book a service via the app I received a message to tell me that 'Your service is due February 2025, we will contact you nearer the time'. Clearly this was an erroneous message as this would mean that my boiler had not been serviced in February 2024, a service for which I have paid as part of my 24/7 policy. Despite repeated phone calls to 24/7 to enquire as to why my boiler was not services in February 2024 my boiler has still not been serviced. I have again chased 24/7 today, and have been told that the earliest that they are able to service my boiler is 23/01/2025. In essence this will be a 2 year interval between boiler service, which in turn will invalidate the warranty on my new boiler. To say I am annoyed would be an understatement. I have been charged for a service which hasn't been provided, and due to the lack of service by 24/7 the warranty on my new boiler has been invalidated.

21/11/2024,01/11/2024,Gas Products,"As you can see, I initially gave this company a five-star review, as many customers likely do. They are very clever at promising everything a customer wants to hear during the first contact, particularly in an emergency. This makes it easy for people to leave positive reviews right after their initial experience. However, they never ask for feedback on the actual repair work or its outcome, which is where the real problems arise.I recently had two claims—one for a boiler issue and one for a plumbing problem—and the experience has been shocking.Boiler Claim:When the engineer visited, they claimed that my recently installed boiler was eight years old (it is only four years old) and marked it as “at risk.” This designation meant that any repairs would be entirely my responsibility, and the company refused to do anything under the policy. Furthermore, they demanded a full strip service, which I would also have to pay for. Essentially, they offered no service or support but still labeled the boiler as “at risk.”What’s worse is that the boiler was still under warranty, yet the engineer made no effort to check. Instead, they simply declared it “at risk” to push me into paying £2,800 for a replacement boiler. It was clear the engineer’s main goal was to exploit any opportunity to force me to pay thousands of pounds for the company’s profit. The complaints department later justified this by saying the engineer had done nothing wrong, claiming that treating a lie about four-year-old boiler as eight years old was “acceptable.” This reasoning is not only misleading but also insulting.Plumbing Claim:The plumbing issue was handled no better. They sent a plumber who plunged the toilet without resolving the blockage. When I reported that the issue seemed to be more serious and likely required further investigation, I was told their plumbing service only covers basic plunging and does not include any investigation or deeper repairs. As a result, the toilet remained blocked, and they refused to send anyone back.Conclusion:Labeling equipment “at risk” is just a tactic to shift all costs onto the customer while the company takes no responsibility. The boiler replacement and full strip service which not being covered are purely profit-driven schemes, and the engineers seem focused only on finding ways to pressure customers into expensive payments. The fact that they make no effort to honor service or resolve genuine issues is beyond disgusting.I want to warn others to be cautious about trusting this company, as they only interested in making money rather than honour the serviceHere’s the revised version:Subject: Follow-Up on ComplaintI’m following up regarding the company’s delayed response. They finally called me back today, three days later than they were supposed to, the manager claiming the delay was because “my number on their system was incorrect.” This is clearly a lie—if the number was wrong, how were they able to call me now? Such an excuse is both insulting and unprofessional.What’s even worse is that, despite the delay, they stated they wouldn’t be able to do anything to resolve the issue anyway. According to their complaints department who contacted me again to claim again that  the engineer falsely claiming that my four-year-old boiler was eight years old is somehow deemed “acceptable.” If I am dissatisfied with it, I may refer my complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.  This response is nothing short of a joke, and it’s clear they have no intention of taking accountability for their actions.I strongly recommend avoiding this company if you can. Their practices are deceptive, their service unreliable, and their excuses nothing but lies!",LABEL_0,0.786,en,True,True,1.0

The boiler break down on Monday last week, they don't have any availability till Wednesday. The Engineer H Rashid come to fix the boiler and also did the boiler service and provided the CP12 cert with no defect or advisory. The same night the boiler breakdown again and it started leaking water, called the 247 and they mentioned that they will send the engineer again but there is no sign of engineer until Friday afternoon. Upon checking which seen like may be his faulty which may have leak the boiler he started blaming the boiler installation which was done 6 years ago and boiler was working without any leak until he touched the boiler. When requesting what is the fix he just trying to defend himself blaming the installation and saying I am just a remote engineer and this will be looked by the office and may take a week where he know that it will be ice cold weather next week. there is no call or update, requested a local gas engineer to visit and check the fault and he said its a issue with condenser leak (how we dont know, why after 247 engineer visit ), as got 2 children in the property out which one child under 2 we decided to replace the boiler to avoid ice cold weather. The only thing now 247 will blame the installation as to show themselves innocent. We were covered for last 2 year, why your engineer visiting previously and issuing cert did not point it out and provided the cert with no defective or advisory even this engineer provided the cert. And this is not the first time, last year (Dec) after yearly boiler services the boiler started loosing the pressure and as tenants were on holiday they did not realise until they back and it was over 7 days and we have to pay again to get the engineer to go and look into the issue. the policy WS579912 first Claim id: 1350325 leading into Claim id 1352287       ",LABEL_1,0.884,en,True,True,1.0

This is my second phonecall trying to cancel and the policy still hasn't been cancelled.Full refund given but was a lot of effort to get.Update 12/02/2025 - They have been spamming my phone number and email trying to get me to return with no unsubsribe links. complete spam.

02/12/2024,01/12/2024,Unknown,"Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Poor Service and Contract Cancellation PolicyDear [Customer Service Team / 24/7 Home Rescue],I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the services provided by your company, 24/7 Home Rescue. Unfortunately, I have encountered consistent issues with the quality of service, which has been far below acceptable standards.Due to this poor experience, I attempted to cancel my contract. However, I was informed that I would still need to pay for an entire month of service, despite not utilizing any of the services during this period. Additionally, I was charged an unexpected penalty fee, which I find both unreasonable and unjust.I kindly request that you review this matter and reconsider the charges applied to my account. I believe it is only fair that I am not held financially responsible for services that were neither used nor satisfactory.I look forward to your prompt response and a fair resolution to this matter.Reference :WS602340",LABEL_0,0.679,en,True,True,1.0

The engineer turned up and spent less than 20 minutes completing the thorough service and add the addictive that I paid an additional £39.99 apparently.

03/12/2024,01/12/2024,Gas Products,"The engineer came out and tried to repair the heat exchanger but ended up snapping a screw on one of the electrodes which meant we needed a new one.  The Company ""247 Home Rescue"" then decided it was not cost effective to fit a new one as the bill for parts and labour would be around £600.  They calculated that my boiler was 8 years old and they would not do any repair costing more than £250! (Beware of this loophole). They terminated my contract and sent me a quote for a new boiler.I then contacted British Gas and explained the situation.  I took a Homecare agreement out with them for a similar monthly payment, they arrived the next day, fit a new heat exchanger and its been fine ever since. My problem with this Company is that their engineer snapped the screw which caused the problem and then the Company refused to repair the boiler because the work was going to cost more than £250.  My yearly premium was more than £250!   This same engineer has been coming to the property for 4 years and had been the only person to have ever worked on the boiler.

I was then offered a service at short notice. It feels exactly like the start of a scam and is very disconcerting. Why can't you book online? Why can you only choose the next day or no day at all? Also, my renewal price is almost double, which is fine, but when I wanted to cancel (ie turn off autorenew) this cannot be done online and has to be done on the phone. Why? This is unacceptable.

05/12/2024,01/12/2024,Gas Products,"I was with 247 Home Rescue for about 2 years. When the time came to get a boiler service booked the engineer did not show. In the first year I was able to rectify this by chasing them to get another engineer to attend. However, in the second year I couldn't book an engineer on their online booking form and when I then had to contact someone via email or phone the engineer did not show up at the property again. To be honest I couldn't be bothered to chase them again to get another engineer booked in, it is in their service agreement that they should get an engineer to provide a service for my boiler and I shouldn't have to chase them for this each year. So I decided to leave and go to a different company.Secondly, when it came to renewing my cover I decided to cancel this renewal. I received a phone call from the company, even though I had specified in my cancellation email to them I did not want them to call me, just to cancel the renewal. When I spoke to the employee on the phone they went through the usual process of trying to offer me a better deal, but after some consideration my decision didn't change. The customer service advisor then kept offering me the same prices and repeating themselves to which I said no I just want to cancel. I kept saying I do not want to renew because I want to go with someone else, you're prices don't make enough different. This went on maybe one or two more times. I then said look I just want to cancel the renewal, I then get asked 'why?' in a reasonably annoyed tone. Making it sound like my reasons were not justified or relevant. I responded to this last question by saying I don't have to give you a reason, I don't want to renew the policy please cancel it. The advisor then tried to offer me the same prices AGAIN to which I said look just cancel the policy I don't want to go through this again. Their tone changed again, like as if I had made it a personal choice on them, they then finally cancelled the renewal.I understand some people may be passionate about what they do and the company they work for, but when I've said 3 times I want to cancel, explained why then get asked why again it is just frustrating. I don't have to give a reason, if I don't want your product then I don't want it, just cancel the renewal. It made me feel as though I was going to be forced into continuing the following year. I don't love being called either just randomly by companies, I'd rather email or do this online for this exact reason, and arguing with me for why I want to leave is not going to change my mind, but confirm my opinion. In reality I should really be refunded for the lack of their boiler service as well! I do not feel that I was rude or disrespectful but I felt the advisor was to me. I probably wouldn't use them again unless their prices were significantly better than everyone else's. ",LABEL_0,0.932,en,True,True,1.0

08/12/2024,01/12/2024,Gas Products,Not worth carrying on with this company. They will find fault to sell a new boiler. Contract no  :MS478810Scaremongering saying things like your boiler wont last very long just pray carbon monoxide alarm does is not triggered. Anyways for me i never had great experience with 247 Home rescue but becuase my boiler has been fine i have been with them for the past few years. Never stopped disappointing me sending me sub contractors who do not know where the water filler pipe were. They eventually send me their company engineer. Well well opened the machine a little throughly then previous ones but then he had to find something and slapped a danger note on the boiler. Very much scaring me to consider a new boiler. Cheap and affordable if your boiler is not breaking down. Please read small prints with this company. ,LABEL_0,0.739,en,True,False,0.9

Took the boiler cover last year in 2023, and was promised 1 free service and full cover for heating. When claimed for some intermittent boiler issues, they never did any repairs, however said that the boiler cannot be covered under their service agreement by their service engineer and wanted to sell a new boiler. They said, they would cover the boiler only if we did the repairs. I do not understand their cover, if I need do the repairs or buy new boiler from them? Had several complaints and later referred to the financial ombudsmen for getting our complaints looked into. It took over and year for the ombudsmen to reward a compensation for their mistakes. However still, they never attended to the claim. Refused to consider the claim and again took the direct debit for second year renewal. Their explanations in return is very rude and threatening. Stated that, I did only request DD return and not cancellation??Worst customer service ! I think these insurance companies are just here to scam people and provide no actual service in reality.

Since the issues below, they did come to fix the door but didn't bother to sign the boiler off with its required checks during the appointment, a 5 minute job. Instead they rushed off and forgot. So we contacted them immediately and they asked for a new appointment. Tenant took more time off. Engineer came out again, arrived with a terrible temper. The boiler has a small decorative ledge on the front to stop the children putting their hands on it. It's one screw to take off. He said he won't remove it. The tenant cried this time because of his attitude and rudeness. Then he left. Job still not complete. I will be cancelling my contract today. This has been the most ridiculous process.  Original review in Sep:Pretty terrible experience since I've been with them. I hired them to install a new boiler and cover the heating system. They installed it, a year later when they serviced it they told me the last engineer had broken parts on it so they needed to fix it. They took ages to fix it and were barely reachable when organising dates/times.The year after another engineer came for a service, he shared that the last engineer had broken the boiler cover and it must be replaced. So again it has been a mess getting hold of the right team to get the cover replaced. Their call centre has no idea what they're doing or what team handles what issue. They tried to pin the cost back onto me when their own engineers admitted it being a problem on their end. They admitted it was their fault on the phone but said they wanted to charge me anyway!

Another cold night.10th day with out heating and hot water. Veissman engineer came out today, questioned if the engineer was even competent, in his words "" the worst job he's seen in 25 years"" Hundreds of pounds worth of damage caused to the boiler components. Ordered parts but if one part isn't in stock it will have to be ordered from Germany if this is the case the boiler won't be fixed until after Christmas.I will also have to pay for the parts because the warranty will be invalid due to 24/7 not servicing to the manufacturers instructions. All the factory seals are still in place internally proving the correct servicing procedure has not been followed.On a plus side I can spend £50 on heaters now. In for another cold one.Day 13, still no heating or hotwater, I've managed to arrange for the manufacturer to repair the boiler on Wednesday, cost me £366 due to the the damage being caused by a 3rd party (24/7 home rescue engineer) and the services,(had 2 off 24/7) not being carried out to the manufacturers instructions.15 days after 24/7 damaged the boiler finally got it repaired by Veissman, cost me £366.Now the pantomime of dealing with the complaints department, Absolutely awful.

14/12/2024,01/12/2024,Gas Products,Been with this company for 2 years last year paid for a rust inhibitor which was not put in this year booked my service and they tell me that the boiler is within 300 mil of the window however this was not picked up last year or previous 6 years with British gas They We're coming out again to check the measurement of the flu to the window and again do service  but failed  to turn up so wasted all day waiting although I did get a text message at 3:30 to say he was on his way he still didn't turn up After putting a complaint in they agreed to come out 2 days later to do the work which they turned up the flu adaptor kit was wrong for the boiler and during the service they topped up the inhibitor in the heating system which was supposed to have been done last year but wasn't however now I have a water leak from the radiator they drained having called them back again I have now got to wait 4 days for them to come and sort out the problem My advice is to avoid this company as the advertising gives you the impression that they operate 24 hours a day however the only thing that operates 24 hours a day is a call line to log an issue then you have to wait 24 to 48 hours for a call back and in my case another 2 days for a booking My complaint is ongoing they did offer me a £29 refund   but was not accepted as I sat in all day waiting  and will update with outcome but may well be going to the ombudsman regarding the issues I've had if outcome is not satisfactory,LABEL_0,0.877,en,True,True,1.0

My annual boiler service was canceled twice—first due to ""unforeseen circumstances"" and the second time after I waited the entire day (engineer was meant to come between 1-6pm), only to be told at 5:30 PM that the engineer had faulty equipment. Half an hour before the first service, I got a call from the sales department asking me to pay £40 for an additional optional service to increase the boiler's longevity. I feel this might be the reason behind the cancellation as they want to prioritise those who are willing to pay extra on top of the premium costs. The next available appointment was over three months away. Because of 24/7's poor service, I've lost my boiler warranty. They seem more interested in taking money than actually serving their customers. In my opinion, this feels like a scam. I would not recommend them to anyone.

Received a call later that day saying I wasn’t covered as it was beyond economical repair as the boiler was too old. Details they had been provided with when I signed up. The part would have been covered but after adding 3 hours labour charge it wasn’t.  They could of course install a new boiler this week at only £40 a month for 10 years. I asked for a manager to call me back but by the time they attempted to call I had resolved my issue with someone more reputable.

21/12/2024,01/12/2024,Gas Products,"My boiler started leaking water in December 24 which meant shutting down the heating system to prevent damage to the room below.  It took 72 hours for the emergency engineer to attend despite the extreme low temperatures at the time. There was no offer of alternative heating and my request to have a manager prioritise a visit was ignored. The engineer's visit led to a demand for £191 for a repair (on top of the £45 call out charge/excess already taken).  I refused as I could see nothing in the policy I bought that suggested I was responsible for paying for the part and repair - that was why I paid £129 for the policy initially to cover these circs.  I eventually had the work done for free under my Aviva home contents and property insurance. They were so much more helpful. I bought this 24/7 policy expecting an urgent repair service - it was a complete waste of money - all they seem keen on is getting more and more from you. Look carefully at their cancellation charges before you sign up, and expect them to claim they cannot list every exclusion in their policy as it would take too much space.",LABEL_0,0.672,en,True,True,1.0

22/12/2024,01/12/2024,Unknown,It is now January 13th and I am still getting reminders about renewing my policy. Now they are going straight to my junk inbox. They are probably still sending texts but as I have blocked them I no longer see them.So I have deleted my long review because I appreciate it was probably too long and that would mean the message I am trying to present is lost. So only buy a policy if you are prepared to keep getting reminders months after you decided to buy a cheaper policy with another company. Make sure if you do not renew with them to cancel your direct debit as soon as possible because it seems each reminder is sent because a failed attempt has been made by 24/7 to take payment. They are now taking the piss! I will never consider using them again because they do not seem to understand that people shop around and buy cheaper when they can especially considering there is no difference in cover. They have no intention of looking at this practise because they are still sending the reminders. My initial review was 3 stars because when I was covered by them I had no issues.

He quickly identified a fault in a switch which would need to be replaced. He said he would contact 247 to get approval to go ahead and would either return that day or on 31st.In preparation for doing the work, he turned off the heating to drain the system.He didn’t return on 30th and by lunchtime on 31st I called 247 back for an update, only to be told they were still awaiting the engineers report and quotation before they could authorise the repair. They were not interested that I live with my elderly mother who they have left with no heating for 2 days and said they should have the report by the end of today or possibly tomorrow and would call me back then.I asked to speak to a manager but was told there is a 24 hour wait for a managers call back.So now we have another day in a freezing cold house, with no heating or hot water.I doubt I will get a call back from a manager having read some other reviews, but I do hope I am proved wrong.This was my first ever time of having to call them out for an issue, and I am not impressed with their Customer Service, the agent was the most disinterested she could possibly be.Definitely avoid this company, I certainly won’t be renewing with them next year.UPDATEA manager did call me and was apologetic, said they had now received the information from the engineer and had agreed to the fix, but it required a drain down of the system, which I’m not covered for (even though I have the top level of cover) so another £108 spent (discounted from £145 due to the inconvenience) and now 1 day later and still no sign of the engineer, so another day/night sat in a freezing cold house with no heating or hot water.",LABEL_0,0.761,en,True,True,1.0

31/12/2024,01/12/2024,Gas Products,"I was advised and then emailed to get an independent second opinion about the boiler at my new build home. The first engineer was shifty and in a hurry to finish the Friday late afternoon job. However, the company wouldn't believe me and didn't want to send another engineer to confirm the error in findings. I ended up not getting reimbursed, and surprisingly, after this independent opinion was received, a second engineer could be organised. I have been scammed. ",LABEL_0,0.933,en,True,False,0.9

31/12/2024,01/12/2024,Gas Products,The service engineer was excellent.We had a problem booking. We booked 2 months in advance for an appointment in November for it to be cancelled 1 day in advance. We were then told we would not be able to have an appointment until March. We considered this unacceptable as we wanted the boiler serviced before winter. After a phone call we were eventually given one in December.,LABEL_0,0.932,en,True,True,1.0

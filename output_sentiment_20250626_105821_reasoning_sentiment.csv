03/01/2024,British Gas,"Worst energy company I've ever had. They had 3 meters attached to my bill, it took them 6 months to fix it, which resulted in me getting a Â£3,000 bill. They did finally amend it when I moved out, but ignored my final meter reading and estimated higher usage. Every time I spoke to a member of the team I'd be promised a call back, or a fix that never came. I raised a complaint against them, and yet still to hear anything back.",-90,"‘Worst energy company’, 6-month fix delay leading to £3,000 bill, ignored callbacks and complaints"
03/01/2024,British Gas,"Have been a customer for 10 years with no issue. In October I received an email to say theyâ€™d moved me to a new system. Since then Iâ€™ve had constant issues. No bill generated for 2 months. I had to contact them 4 times and theyâ€™ve now created 2 separate bills, I contacted again and was assured only1 of these was due to be taken by direct debit. Today theyâ€™ve taken both - which is an overpayment of Â£300. Have called again to be met with an advisor that cannot answer what is happening with my bill or why theyâ€™ve taken Â£300 extra, cannot answer what alternative payment options there are if I cancel my direct debit. My smart meter has also stopped supplying readings since the system move and they are still yet to send an engineer to sort this. This is now the 7th time Iâ€™ve called in the last month and still have no resolution. Think I will need to move energy companies based on this.UPDATE - the reply to this review advised me to contact via Facebook. Iâ€™ve done so and surprise surprise theyâ€™re unable to help as Iâ€™m on the new system. â€œA specialist teamâ€ need to deal with customers on the new system and they are incapable and have no idea what they are doing. An absolute joke.

03/01/2024,British Gas,I am in a lot of debt with British Gas for some reason. After many calls of explaining how my meter is wrong and has bitumen coming from it I still havnt had this problem resolved. I was offered a smart meter but nobody after staying in all day nobody  turned up. when I called I was told the appointment had been cancelled but wasn't informed.

Then told me that I owed then Â£550 but in fact they owed me that. I moved to Octopus ðŸ™ best energy provider out there.

However British Gas refused to send me the email confirmation in the format as my bank had requested (A non editable email). I know have to wait 5 working days to hopefully have my money returned. Interestingly when I complained they ignored the point of my compliant  which included  that I have been charged late payment fees for other bills due to them fraudulently taking my money and basically dismissed the fact that I am paying for their mistake!

Too badMy electric account has moved over to the new system however this has meant that I canâ€™t access my gas account which has not been transferred Iâ€™ve contacted customer services via phone and chat.

I didnâ€™t believe that at the time and waited 28 days to get in touch againAfter waiting in a chat Q of 497 I was told there was probably an error stopping the transfer. That was it.

I've just checked my account and money should be deducted on 1st of each month but nothing was taken!! Again, will they randomly take money of my account despite having DD set correctly?? ## UPDATE: after talking to customer service, it turns out BG has not migrated my DD mandate correctly hence no money was taken. This means I will need pay two bills next month after they inform the bank!! Absolute joke of a company!!The new bills are so confusing to read sometimes. I'm on variable DD and my bill says ""we will regularly review your payment amount of Â£0.00 to make sure you're on track to cover your expected energy use"".  Does this make any sense since I'm on variable DD and therefore pay for what I use? This looks like I'm not paying anything each month!! Talking to customer service is like chinese whispers. Absolutely useless. They don't know how to answer some questions or don't the info on the system. Don't even get me started on the new pathetic app!

I provided several actual readings but they were never accepted, even after escalations, and BG proceeded to estimate - totally incorrectly.I decided to close the account and provided final readings, with photos, which again were not accepted, and the final bill was re-sent as expected â€“ OVERESTIMATED.I complained again but nothing happened and things were turned to debt collectors, from whom I now  receive regular threats, which is outrageous.I then raised a complain through Resolver (case RES10727320), to which I finally received an acknowledgement from BG that they are looking into it within 21 days.30+ days came and went and not a single response.

There is only my son and myself in the house on an evening, both out all day, we are careful with our heating and turning sockets off etc.I have asked BG twice now to send an engineer to check everything is okay with my meters and for the 2nd time they have not shown up to the appointment. So not only have I lost 2 days in wages, they do not seem interested in the slightest to investigate why my costs are so high in comparison to my neighbours and anyone else I know for that matter. I opted for a fixed tariff at around Â£160 per month which has not been honoured and instead changed my payments to Â£261 without my knowledge. So tell me, why are other providers quoting me at Â£74 per month, but you are adamant, British Gas, that i am not even paying a enough with my current direct debit?! Purely taking advantage and making as much profit as you can whilst draining the life out of your customers.

04/01/2024,British Gas,"I experienced simply terrible customer service. I telephoned and asked for a re-estimation of my power usage (due to there now being less people in the house using power), and a re-evaluation of my monthly fee. Initially, the representative decided that this meant I couldn't afford the bill and asked what I could afford to pay. (I hadn't mentioned any financial hardship, simply that with less people in the house, the power usage would be less, therefore the bill should be lower). Then the representative took the position of ""we can't do that. After 3 months of there being less people in the house, we'll look at it then"".So, I would be paying excess for the next 3 months!They made no attempt to finding a solution, no attempt to try to understand my position.So, on principle I have now swapped to a different power supplier! After this experience I could never recommend British Gas to anyone.Addendum: >As British Gas requested, I forwarded them details of my poor experience, (see their response to this review) but I never heard anything further from them on the matter. However, having paid my final bill in full, and then having cancelled the Direct Debit, I subsequently received an email from British Gas (February 3rd) protesting the closure of the Direct Debit.

04/01/2024,British Gas,"I'm just absolutely gutted about my entire situation. Been with BG for 6 years and always been amazing. Until this year. In May they wanted to put my bill up from Â£92 a month to over Â£550. I called them and the me and the lady in the phone agreed Â£200 a month for the next 6 months until my contract ended. This was after I told her I had a disabled daughter and husband and I simply couldn't afford what they were suggesting. I specifically asked if this would leave me with a large bill and then end and she said no, and that the bills would be manually over written. And they were. So that was great!Until my contract ended in Nov last year. And British Gas decided they wanted to claw all of that back and go back on their word. Â£1500 taken from my bank a week before Christmas with no warning, sending me overdrawn. And a further Â£383 pending. This was after my contract ended. I called twice to be told this was a system error by British Gas but neither could give me a resolution to the problem. I went on live chat 3 times (I have screenshots) to two people saying it was a British Gas error, and one person saying he will investigate and get back to me within 7 days. It's been two weeks and I have heard nothing.Last night's live chat the man was rude and unhelpful and just kept repeating that I owed nearly 2 grand and they also added an extra Â£43 to the already pending Â£383 (This being 6 weeks after leaving them so where did that come from?)I just want clarification on how I suddenly owe so much, someone to comfirm it if is an error and how much I do realistically have outstanding and what the next steps are from here?I have a tint 2 bed house, no way I could owe so much surely? And my phone call was the 20th of May last year, made in the morning, and she confirmed our bill would be settled if I paid the Â£200! I could see on my online account the bills were being over written but now suddenly that's all disappeared off my account!You've made 1 billion in profits in a cost of living crisis by purely being greedy and doing this to people!

08/01/2024,British Gas,"Needed to change a start meter installation, the first advisor did not warm transfer, the second advisor was super helpful, but the phone line disconnected 3 tines! Thankfully, the 2nd advisor called me back each time - the advisor gets 5 stars, but the experience only gets 3. British gas need to sort the phone line issues!Based on this week's experience I have now changed my review to 1 star. Your customer service is truly shocking.",-50,"Frequent call drops despite helpful advisor, customer service ‘shocking’"

08/01/2024,British Gas,I recognised a larger than usual figure on my account for gas.

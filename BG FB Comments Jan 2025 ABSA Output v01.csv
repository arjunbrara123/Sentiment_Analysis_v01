02/02/2025,01/02/2025,"Attention all parents and carers!Please join our Facebook group:'Protest to fight school fines'We’re campaigning to secure 10 days of term-time leave for every child.This is not just about taking holidays—it’s about family time, respite, celebrating special occasions, and addressing the various needs that families may have for time off during term time. This change will benefit all families, especially those with children who have SEND.🚫 Did you know? Parents can receive two fines over a three-year period, but local authorities can choose to skip fines and proceed directly to prosecution. After the second fine, the third offence automatically leads to court action, which could result in a criminal record and a heavier fine unless there’s a statutory defence.📢 🪧 We need your support! Join us at six locations for protests on Saturday, 8th March: Nottingham, Durham, Leeds, Liverpool, Southampton, and Norwich.Please sign and share the petition—every voice is essential to this cause! 🙏➡️ https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700047",0,Unknown,60,"The review expresses a positive sentiment towards the campaign for term-time leave, highlighting the benefits for families and the importance of community support.

His original appointment was for TODAY not good enough, if it is not fixed he will end up at riskHere are my brothers thoughtsSo, British Gas cancelled this morning’s appointment to repair our boiler and restore our hot water and heating. Their promise is, if your are vulnerable and at risk they will get to you within a day. No hot water or heating, then two days. We booked our repair on Friday when it was -5 outside. When they cancelled today’s call out, it was because of the need to attend emergency call outs for the vulnerable. I have no issue with that. I’m disappointed, but I recognise the need to help those at risk. The young woman who called me, was polite, professional and precise. However, the bad news she had to deliver to me was that it would be the 21st January before they could book me in again. That’s a week on Tuesday. That’s nine days from now and eleven from my original booking. I am so disappointed with British Gas,  the promises in their adverts are meaningless. It’s just as well we have a wood burner otherwise we would have really struggled. Thankfully, we have friends who have offered help and support, showers and heaters.

05/01/2025,01/01/2025,"We’ve had several contacts with British Gas trying to fit a smart metre,  we were told that the  area where our current electricity meter is located would be too small for the smart meter to be fitted. However we have received call after call from British Gas requesting an appointment to fit one - we decided to let an engineer come to the house to see the very limited space.The appointment was made but unfortunately the engineer called us the day of the appointment to say he had been called away on an emergency - he never kept the appointment with us.I don’t know what sort of report that engineer put in at the end of his working day but British Gas now think we have smart meter and are trying to change our direct debit to an extortionate amount based on purely fictitious smart meter readings (god knows where you got the figures from) - I’ve tried through “Chat” to resolve this but the agent ended the session.We may both be pensioners (for whom you are supposed to take extra care) but we are IT literate, we were asked on the “chat” to upload a photo of our meter, in case we were senile and didn’t know what one looked like and when the photo wouldn’t upload the agent ended the call.  Can I  just reiterate we do not have a smart meter, we have never had an engineer here to fit a smart meter, a smart meter has never crossed our threshold. We have two separate meters for Gas and Electricity in two separate rooms.I am a perfectly compos mentis local councillor who runs a successful food club and who would  recognise a new meter and a gas engineer if ever I saw one.I am hoping for an early resolution to my issue as I am a busy lady and have better things to occupy my time such as  trying to help other people who are struggling to meet the cost of living crisis and surely you have no authority to take money from our account based on fictitious information.",90,Energy,-90,"The review expresses significant frustration and dissatisfaction with British Gas's service, highlighting issues such as miscommunication, lack of follow-through, and an erroneous assumption about the installation of a smart meter.

10/01/2025,01/01/2025,"British Gas A class action lawsuit against British Gas could potentially arise if their IT issues have caused widespread harm to customers, such as financial loss, credit damage, or breach of contract. However, for a class action to proceed in the UK, certain conditions must be met:1. Legal Basis for the Claim • Breach of Contract: If customers can show British Gas failed to uphold its contractual obligations (e.g., properly processing payments or issuing accurate bills), it could form the basis of a lawsuit. • Consumer Rights Violations: If British Gas’s actions breach consumer protection laws, such as the Consumer Rights Act 2015, customers may have grounds to sue. • Negligence: If British Gas’s system migration was poorly planned or implemented, leading to foreseeable losses, this could also be a factor.2. Widespread Impact • A class action requires multiple individuals to have been similarly affected. For instance, if thousands of customers experienced incorrect billing, were unable to make payments, or faced financial penalties due to these issues, it strengthens the case.3. Evidence of Harm • Customers would need to prove they suffered actual harm, such as: • Financial loss (e.g., late fees, overcharges). • Damage to credit ratings. • Stress or inconvenience caused by ongoing issues.4. Regulatory Investigations • The UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, may investigate British Gas for systemic issues. If Ofgem finds British Gas at fault, it could increase the likelihood of a legal case, though Ofgem’s enforcement powers are separate from customer lawsuits.5. Legal Coordination • Customers would need to organize and appoint legal representation for a group claim.

07/01/2025,01/01/2025,Wasted half hour of my life today on your chat system! We had a new monitor fitted at the end of November so as it would do gas and electric (old one only did electric) the gas connected fine but the electric never connected!!! I was told this would be picked up by tech team within 48 hours and someone would be out to fix it within 30 days. Funnily enough…… we haven’t been contacted! So I tried the chat out today and 1. It took a loooong time to get to where I needed to! 2. I’m being told that there’s only 2 date choices for January both of which I can’t do So it was a lie that it would be fixed in 30 days and I potentially have to wait for at least another 30 days to get it sorted. I was told that my complaint has been logged and that the conversation was being put down as resolved and there’s nothing more they can help me with today! So now I’m stuck with a smart monitor that no longer reads the electric!

09/01/2025,01/01/2025,. I rang British gas today fortunately the first advisor was reasonably competent. I've spoke to 30 others. He managed to collate all the complaint reference numbers closed and open. Made a manager aware and suspended my electric bill as its not my fault that I'm getting estimated bills. I have logged a complaint with ofgem today and sent a transcript of you asking me to read my meter knowing I cannot walk. As I explained my smart meter was put in to help me yet as I've explained my care team can't read the meter nor is it their responsibility. The advisor today agreed. British Gas created this problem to thousands of customers by moving people to a new billing system. I'm vulnerable but in 8 months nothing has been done. Your metering team were supposed to contact me on 4 occasions. 31 advisors. 15 complaints. 7 conversations online. 2 engineers ( 1 failed ). Promised 7 manager calls. Ofgem have said today this is a disgrace. How is 8 months the highest priority? Why didn't after 3 complaints this get escalated like Ofgem said? Why the failings of above. You haven't helped at all. All you have done is ask a disabled person on your system who cannot walk to read his meter and today dilute or try to diminish British gas responsibility by asking family and friends to read my meter. So no why close the complaint. It isn't resolved and you've done nothing. Had a smart meter put in to auto send readings. You move people to a new billing system and it drops off. Meter works but doesn't seem readings. Your own advisors can't contact the metering team they don't have access. 8 months of incompetence.,90,Energy,-95,"The review expresses extreme frustration and dissatisfaction with the service provided by British Gas.

10/01/2025,01/01/2025,"A class action lawsuit against British Gas could potentially arise if their IT issues have caused widespread harm to customers, such as financial loss, credit damage, or breach of contract. However, for a class action to proceed in the UK, certain conditions must be met:1. Legal Basis for the Claim • Breach of Contract: If customers can show British Gas failed to uphold its contractual obligations (e.g., properly processing payments or issuing accurate bills), it could form the basis of a lawsuit. • Consumer Rights Violations: If British Gas’s actions breach consumer protection laws, such as the Consumer Rights Act 2015, customers may have grounds to sue. • Negligence: If British Gas’s system migration was poorly planned or implemented, leading to foreseeable losses, this could also be a factor.2. Widespread Impact • A class action requires multiple individuals to have been similarly affected. For instance, if thousands of customers experienced incorrect billing, were unable to make payments, or faced financial penalties due to these issues, it strengthens the case.3. Evidence of Harm • Customers would need to prove they suffered actual harm, such as: • Financial loss (e.g., late fees, overcharges). • Damage to credit ratings. • Stress or inconvenience caused by ongoing issues.4. Regulatory Investigations • The UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, may investigate British Gas for systemic issues. If Ofgem finds British Gas at fault, it could increase the likelihood of a legal case, though Ofgem’s enforcement powers are separate from customer lawsuits.5. Legal Coordination • Customers would need to organize and appoint legal representation for a group claim. This often involves solicitors specializing in group litigation or class actions.",90,Energy,-50,"The review discusses potential legal actions against British Gas due to significant issues affecting customers, indicating a negative sentiment.

01/02/2025,01/02/2025,"British Gas your new billing system is faulty. You know it is and continue to use it, therefore knowingly incorrectly billing customers. Which amounts to fraud in my opinion. Not only this, but  you then take weeks and months, an often a complaint to the energy ombudsman before you correct the bills. I now have had two bills corrected. I keep being told that my complaint is resolved, but I do not believe it is. Yes my bill is correct, but I have not had a satisfactory explanation as to why these errors are occurring, what British Gas is doing to sort it, or how vulnerable customers with billing errors are being identified and dealt with, because I do not believe they will have the ability to fight with you for months to fix your mistakes. I am absolutely disgusted with the way it has been handled. I recieved one email that amounted to gas lighting, only for a customer service call handler fix the bill later in a matter of seconds. If that could happen, why did it take nearly two weeks and gaslighting for us to get there. Do not tell me to take my complaint through the proper means as I have and your complaint handlers insist my issue is resolved. The bills corrected might be, the issue is clearly not. Please see the attached screen shots of my estimated gas reading for the 01/01/2025 and then please see the screen shot of my bill statement issued on the 11/01/2025. Please note the estimated gas meter reading for the 01/01/2025. Why the discrepancy? And this was after the first billing system had reset my gas meter reading from approx 2300 to 50.

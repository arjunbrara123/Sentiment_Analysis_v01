Appointment Scheduling,1,Frequent last-minute cancellations and poor communication from British Gas,"I recently scheduled a smart meter installation with British Gas, with the appointment set for today between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM. Understanding the importance of being available for such appointments, I took the day off work, anticipating the arrival of an engineer to complete the installation. At 11:53 AM, merely minutes before the end of the scheduled appointment window, I received a text from British Gas informing me that the engineer would not be able to make it to my property to carry out the installation. This last-minute cancellation is not just about the inconvenience of having rearranged my day. It's a matter of professional respect and the efficient management of customers' expectations. Taking a day off work involves not just a time commitment but also a financial cost to me. The lack of prior notification and the timing of the cancellation message – practically at the end of the appointment window – only adds to the frustration and gives the impression of complete disregard for the customer's time and commitments.","Very easy to make, cancel and reschedule my appointment.","Octopus customers report that appointment scheduling, cancellation, and rescheduling are straightforward and customer-centric, minimizing wasted time and frustration. In contrast, British Gas frequently cancels appointments at the last minute, causing customers to lose time and money, and communicates poorly about changes.","Implement proactive, real-time notifications and easy self-service rescheduling for appointments, ensuring customers are informed well in advance of any changes.",Octopus,2.32,61.37,59.04
Appointment Scheduling,2,Repeated failed or missed appointments and lack of follow-up from British Gas,"This time? in the last 9 months, British Gas has booked 5 appointments to look at smart meter issues that they found. Out of those 5 appointments, an engineer only showed up once. The one time that they did show up obviously didn't fix the issue. Today the 5th appointment was just cancelled and another one booked for next week. I suspect that appointment will be cancelled on the day also. I understand sometimes British Gas can get swamped with emergency calls but cancelling 4 appointments on the day out of 5 is absolutely terrible service. I stay in for an engineer to attend but they keep cancelling late afternoons so 4 days wasted, and could be 5 next week.",Deb quickly resolved the issue and made an appointment for an engineer to attend in the next week at a time convenient for me. Very friendly too!,"Octopus demonstrates faster resolution and reliable follow-through on engineer appointments, with customer service agents empowered to resolve issues and secure convenient slots. British Gas, by contrast, repeatedly fails to deliver on scheduled appointments and does not proactively follow up, leading to customer frustration and wasted time.","Strengthen operational coordination between customer service and field teams to ensure appointments are honored, and empower agents to resolve and escalate persistent issues quickly.",Octopus,2.32,61.37,59.04
Customer Service,1,Repeated failure to resolve issues and poor complaint handling,"Each time being told your metres are working even though they were not. Even the smart in house device didnâ€™t work although British Gas said it was fixed. I logged 4 complaints each of which were never actioned... I have also been overcharged and will continue to do so until fixed. I called last week and was told I will call you back personally this time next week by an agent. Each time I speak to an agent I apparently have notes taken. No call was receive and upon calling today I cannot actually believe how I was treated. First I was told there were no notes on my account, no complaints and to shut up as the agent couldnâ€™t hear me.","I had challenges with a new smart meter IHD - some user error, but not all. I contacted the Octopus help line via email. Josh W from the New Zealand team was knowledgeable and demonstrated immense patience with my questions, spread over multiple back and forth emails. He managed to resolve my issues and improve my understanding. The ability to keep dealing with the same individual Octopus support representative, over a period of weeks, was fantastic.","British Gas customers report unresolved issues, complaints being closed without resolution, lack of follow-up, and rude or dismissive agents. In contrast, Octopus customers highlight being able to deal with the same support representative, receiving patient, knowledgeable help, and seeing their issues resolved through consistent follow-up.","Implement a named case handler system for complaints, ensuring continuity and accountability until full resolution.",Octopus,-3.91,67.13,71.04
Customer Service,2,Difficulty accessing and using customer service channels,"The chat system is a complete joke - literally a joke and it is complete pot luck of who you speak to over the phone. Sometimes you get someone that completely understands the issue and wants to help, other times you get someone who is having a laugh with several colleagues around them and cannot be a**** doing anything to help, only to get you off the phone. I have tried to launch several complaints to no avail. Finally submitted one today so I'll no doubt have a laugh at their response.","I got through to customer services in less than 5 minutes, (compare that to other companies being on hold for 20 or 30 minutes or more!) Danni (Team R01) was so helpful and friendly and realised my issue straight away.","British Gas customers face long waits, disconnected chats, inconsistent agent quality, and difficulty escalating complaints. Octopus customers frequently report quick call answering, friendly and effective agents, and efficient resolution of issues.",Streamline and monitor all customer service channels for speed and reliability; set and publish clear response time targets.,Octopus,-3.91,67.13,71.04
Energy Readings,1,"Smart meter and app failures lead to inaccurate or inaccessible readings for British Gas customers, while Octopus provides easier access and correction.","On the issue of user experience, my husband and I raised about a year ago what we thought was a reasonable request to have access to our real-time gas and energy consumption readings so we could better-manage our usage. We were advised we could access this via their app, but we repeatedly ran into issues including every day usage showing as the same despite us knowing we'd used more or less on particular days. Agents weren't able to account for why this might be and raised several technical queries which were never followed up on. The app continued to be super glitchy and even now, we've lost even more access via the app as it seems to think we don't even have an account.","I really do rate this company. They have good customer service, a very easy and accessible app which lets you submit readings with ease and most importantly UK based call centres. ... They seemed to be the best value for money too! ...","British Gas customers frequently report that their smart meters fail to transmit readings and their app is unreliable or inaccessible, making it difficult to monitor or submit accurate usage. In contrast, Octopus customers consistently praise the ease of submitting readings and accessing usage data via a reliable app, with issues quickly resolved by support.","Prioritise robust app functionality and ensure seamless integration with smart meters to provide real-time, accurate usage data.",Octopus,-4.78,59.97,64.75
Energy Readings,2,"British Gas relies on estimated readings even when actual readings are submitted, causing overbilling and customer frustration; Octopus is more responsive in correcting errors and accepting customer readings.","British Gas recorded an estimated reading as an actual reading, when I hadn’t submitted one, that was way over my actual usage, in April 2023, when they were migrating accounts to a new system. I’ve since sent them photos of my meter but they still won’t accept my readings, and are holding a large amount of my money for gas I haven’t used, despite promising to put it right.","I misread my meter readings I submitted to you on two occasions. ... Ben from Brighton understood my mistake, corrected my errors and Has credited my account. First class service. Phone call answerd promptly and my thanks to him for resolving this issue.","British Gas customers report that even when they submit actual readings (including photographic evidence), the company often ignores them in favour of estimates, leading to overcharging and protracted disputes. Octopus, while not perfect, is repeatedly cited as quickly correcting errors, accepting customer readings, and issuing refunds or credits promptly.",Implement a process to always prioritise customer-submitted readings (with evidence) over estimates and empower agents to resolve billing disputes immediately.,Octopus,-4.78,59.97,64.75
Meter Installations,1,Delayed or failed commissioning of smart meters and poor follow-up,"Appointment for installation of smart meters at end of September.  Only electricity meter fitted because engineer didnt have a gas meter in his van. Another appointment a week later to install gas meter. After installation no gas usage information on monitor so engineer said it should operate after 2 days. It didn't, so called British Gas, who said unplug monitor for 3 days and it should be OK. Still not working when switched back on. Several frustrating phone calls later system still not working on 1st November, and still awaiting BGs resolution. Really poor service and just going round in frustrating circles.","Had a faulty Gas Smart Meter. I called Octopus too report it and a date was set for an engineer to replace it.  The engineer called the day before to give me a estimated time of arrival and correctly guessed the the display on the meter was blank. He came and fixed the meter and provided us with a new In-home Display. He told us if the display is not working within 72 hours, we're to call Octopus and report it. 72 hours passed and the display remained blank. I called  Octopus and got through to Aidan at Customer service. I explained the situation and he asked me to send a picture of the barcode on the bottom of the display. I did so and was informed that the display should start working within 15-20 minutes and if not, to ring back. Within 5 minutes the display was working perfectly. 5star service","Octopus demonstrates proactive, clear communication and rapid resolution when smart meter issues arise, including follow-up and technical troubleshooting. In contrast, British Gas customers experience repeated delays, lack of resolution, and poor communication, leaving issues unresolved for weeks.","Implement a structured post-installation follow-up process and empower support teams to resolve technical issues promptly, mirroring Octopus's approach.",Octopus,10.45,61.7,51.25
Meter Installations,2,Repeated appointment cancellations and lack of engineer availability,"I had an appointment booked to have a smart meter installed on Wednesday 30 th October 2024 between 8 am and 12- 00. I received 3 reminders  from British Gas about this appointment, and asking for  the area to be cleared to help the engineer, which I did. Tuesday 29th October I received a text message cancelling the appointment due to the availability of an engineer, and asking me to rebook the appointment. I then received an email thanking me for re -booking the appointment for 16th DECEMBER between 10am and 14-00 pm, which I did not book. I have cancelled that appointment, and now I don't intend to have a smart meter fitted. British Gas say they are leading the way in smart meter installation in the U.K. they are not going to achieve this by letting people down at the very last minute.","When I was told by my gas engineer that my combi boiler wasn't working because gas wasn't getting to it I had to contact Octopus, by e-mail, at 10.15am because it was a weekend to request a new meter, they got back to me within about 30 minutes and arranged for a new smart meter to be fitted that day. The engineer was there by 2.30pm and it took about 15 minutes to install the new meter. Excellent service from Lottie the Octopus customer service young lady, she rang me and e-mailed me several times throughout the day to check that I was ok and the engineer that attended, Michael, couldn't have been more helpful and courteous and he explained everything in clear and concise layman's terms.","Octopus demonstrates rapid response and same-day installation in urgent cases, with proactive communication and customer care. British Gas, by contrast, frequently cancels appointments at short notice, reschedules without consultation, and fails to deliver on promised installation dates, causing frustration and loss of trust.","Increase engineer capacity and improve scheduling systems to minimize cancellations, and ensure customer-centric communication and flexibility in rebooking.",Octopus,10.45,61.7,51.25
Value For Money,1,"Complex, inaccurate, and non-transparent tariff pricing and billing at British Gas","Most expensive company ever! Do not be fooled into signing up to a fixed rate contract with these providers! ... By August they had increased my fixed rate to a whopping £245 a month which was taken straight out of my bank without consulting me first of this drastic change. ... On asking to leave the contract as I stated I would never have signed up to this contract for 12 months had I been given that quote to start with, I was told I had to pay £150 exit fee. ... I am now switching to octopus energy and hoping it goes smoother than the process with British gas!",The further bonus is that there are no exit fees so if I want to review it again say in 3 months and change supplier and tariff that's ok too. The rates may or may not be competitive with other providers but I'm happy that I have been proactive and am making a saving from the maximum cap prices and with very little risk of being locked into prices for 15 months that may go up or down as no one seems to know anyway.,"Octopus offers clear, competitive tariffs with no exit fees, allowing customers to switch easily if prices change. British Gas, by contrast, has been reported to increase fixed rates unexpectedly, apply high exit fees, and provide confusing or inaccurate billing, making it difficult for customers to assess true value for money.","Simplify tariff structures, ensure transparent billing, and remove punitive exit fees to match Octopus' flexibility and clarity.",Octopus,15.41,66.37,50.96
Value For Money,2,"Poor handling of smart meters and special tariffs, leading to missed savings at British Gas",Switched to an EV tariff on 16th June. Checked the usage on the app and was being charged peak price during off peak times. Call BG and was told it will change over when first statement is published. Statement was sent on 2nd August and only showed charges at peak. Contact BG again and was told issue will be resolved within 7-10 days. Checked today and still no change. ... Also no notes from previous calls. ... After being assured that the issue will be escalated and dealt with I received a revised statement this afternoon and still showed charges for peak usage when it should have been off peak.,Sam ... advised moving to a cheaper tariff which should help to reduce our energy costs as winter approaches. Octopus Go - smart EV tariff with super cheap electricity between 00:30 - 05:30 every night & advised using household items (dishwasher/ washing machine etc) at same time to take advantage of lower prices. Thanks Sam - keep doing good work!,"Octopus is proactive and knowledgeable in helping customers access and benefit from special tariffs like EV and off-peak rates, ensuring customers actually receive the savings. British Gas customers report confusion, delays, and incorrect billing when trying to access similar value-for-money tariffs, resulting in lost savings and frustration.","Improve internal processes and staff training to ensure correct application of special tariffs and smart meter integration, matching Octopus' proactive support and accuracy.",Octopus,15.41,66.37,50.96
Accounts and Billing,1,Delayed and inconsistent refunds of credit balances,"Come on British Gas... How long does it take to give a refund? Your a top brand in the Uk..... with a very poor service to customers. Lets recap.... According to your latest statement... I am on Smart meters ... and I am Â£ 1711.16 in Credit.. I have asked over the last month on 4 occasions to refund me , my money. It hasnt happenned yet. ... Another 5 Days later... with no refund in my account, I called again. To be told that my refund was processed but it wasnt successful? We have now allocated this to a specialised team , please rest assured that this review process typically takes up to 7 days to complete . Once the review is finalised and your bill is cleared for release, we will promptly notify you. ... I have no refund yet.","I always feel in control of my energy bills. I can access my account 24/7, change debit payments. On occasions when I’ve been in credit and asked for a refund it has always been paid quickly with no hassle, or questions asked.","Octopus customers report prompt, hassle-free refunds of credit balances, while British Gas customers experience repeated delays, confusion, and lack of proactive communication. Octopus' digital-first, customer-centric approach ensures customers can easily access and reclaim their money, building trust and satisfaction.","Streamline refund processes, automate credit repayments, and proactively communicate refund status to customers.",Octopus,-9.37,60.73,70.1
Accounts and Billing,2,"Billing errors, double billing, and lack of transparency","The phenomenon of double billing, wherein a customer receives two bills for a single submission period despite having submitted the latest meter reading, stands as another glaring issue. This not only results in financial strain but also reflects a severe lack of coordination and accuracy within the billing department of the service provider.","Person was really helpful, listened to me, reviewed my account information and explained the situation with regards to payments etc. She took my reading and changed the billing information and arranged for me to have the credit refunded. Also agreed and assisted change to monthly payment. Nothing was a bother.","Octopus demonstrates clear, responsive, and transparent billing support, with agents empowered to resolve errors and explain charges. British Gas, by contrast, repeatedly issues duplicate or incorrect bills, fails to explain discrepancies, and leaves customers in the dark, causing stress and financial uncertainty.","Invest in billing system accuracy, empower frontline staff to resolve errors, and provide clear, itemized statements.",Octopus,-9.37,60.73,70.1

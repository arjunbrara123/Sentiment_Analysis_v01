Year,Product,Aspect,Analysis
2024,Gas Products,Overall,"British Gas received a mix of positive and negative feedback on gas products, particularly around boiler servicing and repairs. Customers appreciate punctual engineers and efficient servicing: ""Arrived in time. Serviced the boiler and cleaned up. Very professional."" However, issues remain around post-installation faults (""Had a boiler fitted, a week later a slow drip appeared"") and scheduling inefficiencies. Compared to competitors like CheckATrade-reviewed providers, British Gas is seen as reliable but sometimes slow to rectify problems. Competitors gain higher praise for flexibility in appointments and pricing transparency. British Gas could focus on post-service follow-ups and faster response times for issues arising after installations."
2024,Plumbing & Drains,Overall,"British Gas competes with HomeServe in this space, with mixed reviews. While positive feedback mentions ease of scheduling (""Very quick call-out when we had a leaking pipe""), negative reviews highlight unresolved issues and miscommunication (""Asked them to repair a leak, but they didn t know where it was and left""). HomeServe outperforms British Gas in responsiveness and engineer communication, suggesting an opportunity for British Gas to enhance diagnostic training and ensure engineers arrive better prepared for each job."
2024,Home Electrical,Overall,"HomeServe leads in this category with strong customer feedback on prompt service and effective problem-solving. British Gas s electrical service reviews are fewer, but the negative themes align with complaints seen in other categories: difficulty scheduling and lack of clear communication. One customer reported ""The engineer gave me conflicting information, which delayed repairs."" British Gas may need to focus on improving internal communication between customer support and field engineers to prevent such inconsistencies."
2024,Appliance Cover,Overall,"Domestic & General dominates this space, with reviews highlighting both efficiency and frustration. Positive reviews commend quick replacements and friendly service (""Had my old dishwasher replaced within a week excellent service.""), while negative reviews cite long wait times (""Repair never materialized. No communication.""). British Gas could differentiate itself by emphasizing reliability in repair completion times, as delays appear to be a major pain point for customers across all providers."
2024,Energy,Overall,

2024,Plumbing & Drains,Appointment Scheduling,"Reviews indicate that appointment availability is reasonable, but late cancellations are a recurring issue (""Waited all day, only to be told they couldn't make it.""). HomeServe s same-day service gets positive mentions, suggesting British Gas should offer last-minute availability slots for urgent plumbing issues to improve responsiveness."
2024,Home Electrical,Appointment Scheduling,"Customers complain about conflicting scheduling information from customer service (""Was told the engineer was coming, but he never arrived.""). HomeServe s positive reviews highlight better coordination. British Gas should improve scheduling transparency by enabling real-time tracking and reducing last-minute cancellations."

2024,Plumbing & Drains,Response Speed,"Slow response is a common frustration (""Four days without water due to scheduling delays.""). HomeServe s rapid dispatch gets higher marks. British Gas should develop a 24-hour urgent plumbing team to compete."
2024,Home Electrical,Response Speed,"Customers expect rapid electrical issue resolution, but delays are frequent (""Had no power for three days before an engineer came.""). HomeServe s 24-hour response model receives stronger reviews. British Gas should introduce a priority service tier for urgent electrical issues."
2024,Appliance Cover,Response Speed,"Customers complain about excessive wait times for repairs (""Two weeks without a washing machine!""). Domestic & General s poor response speeds provide an opportunity for British Gas to offer a ""48-hour repair or replace"" guarantee as a market differentiator."
2024,Gas Products,Engineer Experience,"Engineers are mostly well-reviewed (""Polite and knowledgeable"") but occasionally lack problem-solving skills (""Came, said they couldn't fix it, and left.""). Competitors with specialized engineers fare better. Actionable: Invest in further training on diagnosing complex gas system issues."
2024,Plumbing & Drains,Engineer Experience,"Some engineers receive high praise (""Polite and explained everything well""), but inconsistency is an issue (""First engineer didn t fix it, second one did."").

2024,Gas Products,Solution Quality,"Most services are completed well, but some repairs fail quickly (""Boiler fixed, but broke again two weeks later.""). Competitors who provide longer guarantees are rated better. Actionable: Extend post-repair guarantees to demonstrate confidence in work quality."
2024,Plumbing & Drains,Solution Quality,"Multiple complaints cite temporary fixes instead of long-term solutions (""Leak stopped, but came back a month later.""). HomeServe s thorough solutions are praised. British Gas should incentivize engineers to perform comprehensive diagnostics rather than quick fixes."
2024,Home Electrical,Solution Quality,"Customers complain about repairs not solving the root cause (""Fixed the symptom, but problem came back.""). HomeServe s detailed inspections receive better feedback. British Gas should offer free secondary inspections for recurring electrical issues to build trust."
2024,Appliance Cover,Solution Quality,"Domestic & General receives poor reviews for repair failures (""Fixed my fridge, but it stopped working again in a week.""). British Gas should ensure rigorous final testing post-repair to differentiate itself."
2024,Gas Products,Value for Money,"Pricing is a concern (""Expensive for what you get.""), especially compared to smaller competitors. British Gas should introduce loyalty discounts or bundled services to improve perceived value."
2024,Plumbing & Drains,Value for Money,"Customers feel pricing is inconsistent (""My neighbor paid less for the same repair.""). Competitors with transparent pricing models fare better. Actionable: Introduce fixed-price repair quotes to improve trust."

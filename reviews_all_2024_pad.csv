Review,Company
Rang up over blocked drain member of team sorted problems promptly and dyno rod attended within 1 hour. Then asked to book boiler check sorted coming next day . Brilliant service.,British Gas
Called to renew my plumbing policy & everything went smoothly and very satisfied with the call.Only 1 thing it did take 20 mins to get through.,British Gas
Great response to a leak in the home,British Gas
"We had an emergency with a hot inlet pipe which split in our downstairs toilet. I phoned customer care, British Gas call handler sorted everything out arranged for a plumber to come out who arrived within hour  and an hour later, everything was sorted. Excellent service would recommend British Gas 100%",British Gas
"Engineer phoned to let us know his ETA on the pre arranged service date.Was friendly, efficient and informative.Explained both what he had done and then the new digital service report system.In the past when we encountered any problem, they were quick to respond.We also pay to have our plumbing covered by them and again , when we had a drainage problem, sent out dynorod to fix it.Efficient, reliable and helpful, exactly what we want for a service like this.",British Gas
"Quick booking to get someone to come out. Really accurate time scales provided. The time taken to be seen was incredibly short for a holiday season booking. Plumber was so knowledgable and friendly, polite and courteous. Additionally  he was very thorough.",British Gas
I had a problem with my water pressure and the engineer kept coming back till he had fixed and sorted the problem. It wasn't obvious at first what was causing it but he was very professional and didn't give up till he managed to find the cause.,British Gas
"First time I rang I waited 40 minutes before giving up. However,  second time was only three minutes.  Advisor was friendly,  knowledgeable and helpful.  I don't like that you have to pay Â£60.00 for the plumber to attend when already paying a monthly fee for the home support.",British Gas
When my toilet sprung a leak there was someone there within an hour of me reporting it. Even though it was nighttime. The person who came was friendly and capable and effected a complete repair.,British Gas
"Used Local Hero's for a sink that was not draining well.Plumber was arranged promptly, however, they came out without the tools as not all the vans carry the required equipment. This was charged and a second appointment was arranged with a van that carried the equipment. The initial plumber refused to leave the property unless I paid there and then which goes against Local Hero policy/terms. Due to his intimidation I agreed to sign and pay for this as he refused to leave and said the charge was increasing whist he was still in the property and a second visit was forced for a second fee. Both charges were above that advertised on the company's own website and ended up costing twice the inflated price due to the company not carrying all equipment. The slow draining sink was resolved on the second visit but, we used local hero's so that we did not end up with an unscrupulous company. Unfortunately, this was not the case. ",British Gas
"The engineer who attended was great and informative. He gets 5 The problem is actually getting through to talk to someone re problem. A. I. only gives limited option and if your problem doesn't fit .,,, tough luck! Took me two calls to get hold of advisor. I had a leak in my airing cupboard, only discovered by mark appearing on dining room ceiling below. Had to wait from Sat until Tues for engineer and wrap towels around leak( changed regularly!). Considering the premium for this service, not great.",British Gas
"British Gas Homecare service is to be avoided. Years ago the service was reasonable...but now it is an appalling service. Invariably if you want a plumbing or drainage repair your first contact is with their South African Call Centre after a long wait. The call centre staff are poorly trained.. and even if they don't cut you off and fail to ring back 10 mins or so into the conversation(common).. they will likely arrange a Dyno ""Plumbing"" visit when you clearly state its a blocked toilet or drain...and will send Dyno ""Drains"" when its a clear plumbing issue. Also the standard of workmanship is generally very poor...and engineers fail to return after saying they are going off for parts. Also the drainage booking staff are rude and unhelpful when the Call Centre sends the wrong engineer...saying they won't help and the customer has to start again to sort an error out made by their call centre...saying its nothing to do with them and that they are just regional effective franchisees and you have to go back to British Gas Homecare number again...so back to South African call centre!!. Avoid avoid avoid. Appauling service.",British Gas
Excellent service. Very good response. My blocked pipe and leak were fixed in no time. Very reliable. Thank you so much.,British Gas
We have had cause to call British Gas for plumbing repairs over the last year.  We have been so impressed with the ease when requesting assistance.  Their sub contractor has turned up on time and successfully completed repair or replacement.  We are very happy to remain with British Gas for our HomeCare service.,British Gas
"I have been trying to get through to the Plumbing & Drains department of British gas (Dynorod), for the last 3 weeks and constantly the app has crashed recommending to use the phone number given which constantly hung up before I could get through to someone to book a repair, I don't know what has changed but I used to be able to book a repair almost immediately using either the app or phone.",British Gas
I contacted British Gas to book an appointment for Dyna-Rod to come and fix a plumbing issue. The customer service I received was great and they were polite and booked the day and time with no problem at all. Payment was done today and was done after one rejection was I had to resolve before it went through on the second try.,British Gas
I had emergency with blocked drain pipe they came in no time and sorted it out so fast and professionally!,British Gas
"I recently had a blocked drain,I rang British Gas and within 24 hours a contractor arrived and cleared the blockage and power cleaned the drain.Excellent service and would recommend British Gas service plan to everyone.In January our boiler was not igniting, So again I rang British Gas and the next day the engineer arrived and repaired the boiler and carried out the annual service.Excellent work well done British Gas.",British Gas
"I have home cover as I am an oap and unable to do plumbing and electrical work myself anymore.My downstairs toilet is attached to a macerator unit, recently a pipe leading to the unit burst so I contacted British Gas.A plumber came out within a few days took one look at it and said they were not allowed to work on macerators, I pointed out that, even if that was the case, the problem was NOT the macerator but a burst pipe leading to it, he was adamant however and left.I called BG to complain, they confirmed that hidden away in the small print of my contract was an exclusion for macerators and she also dismissed my argument that it was a burst pipe not the macerator.I found a local plumber on Checkatradewho came out and fixed it quickly and efficiently.I was left angry and wondering exactly what I am paying all this money for each month.",British Gas
"Issue resolved, by adjusting an airing cupboard valve",British Gas
"Managed to get through to British Gas on a Sunday late afternoon with a plumbing issue. Very nice customer service agent really helpful.Had to hold for around 40 minutes to get through and couldn't navigate the app to book appointment, but apart from that all good. Thank you",British Gas
Had a domestic disaster drilling into a heating pipe. Really excellent emergency service. Prompt and courteous repair.,British Gas
"Called dump rod out using the home care  scheme with British Gas.The person on the phone was brilliant Dump rod came out and discovered the the blockage was in another area part of our drainage, so could not resolve this and recommend that we call Severn Trent. This we accepted. When I came home from my work the mess dyno rod left my back garden in, the full patio covered in excrement at least an inch thick. Did not even attempt to at least tidy up. I spent the whole weekend cleaning the mess up as im not experienced in this kind of cleaning And to make matters worse it is all over the grass in which my cat and dog cannot now go to the garden and now have to run the  hose over to try and at least dilute this. At cost to myself as I pay water rates Ruined clothes, expense of buying cleaning products and bleach of which will kill the grass and potentially give me very sick animals Would not recommend this company at all",British Gas
The engineer who fixed the leak was excellent but the people from dyno were crap and rude,British Gas
"What a nightmare ... the wrong assessment by their Dyno guy, 2 weeks of delays getting builders in who all said it's a plumbing issue that their Dyno team failed to spot,1 hrs on the phone, and no one picked up . I have heard horror stories about Dyno year sago and seems nothing fixed.You are constantly reverted to their South Africa offices, on bad internet lines and they; know nothing about policies or customer service, they pretend the line drops when you ask them a question they don't understand. BG this is disgraceful do not source without training",British Gas
"Diabolical service.Have had the Homecare service for 6 years. Ok for boiler services - but when you need something else don't bother.I had drain issues before Christmas and an engineer was sent out who did nothing - not surprising as by the time arrived on his allocated day it was dark. He tried to palm off my issue on blocked down pipes - however, once these were cleaned out it turned out the original issue was the rainwater drains, as I'd suspected. Called British Gas again to explain that the engineer needed to come back and look properly this time. Was assured that I wouldn't charged an additional Â£60 excess since it was the same job. The same guy came back - not sure how he's employed because again he was useless and came up with some story about not being able to help because of a ""shared drain"". The drain is not shared at all - as I found out when I paid out for a local person to look at it who actually did a good job.I thought maybe it was just a bad one off experience, however, I then looked at my card statement and found out that I had been charged an additional Â£60 excess for the job - despite being assured that this would not happen!So in addition to the annual cost paid to British Gas I've now paid them Â£120 for some idiot to come out and do no remedial work at my property. Unbelievably poor service. My HomeCare plan auto renewed last week and I've cancelled it as I cannot bear to deal with such incompetence. I've seen Homeserve has good reviews so may try them (providing they don't send out the numpties from DynoRod if there are drain issues).I don't think I have the time or energy to waste trying to contact them to get a refund of at least one lot of the Â£60 that I shouldn't have paid. Emailed, used the chat and called already to be passed from one department to another about the refund. Apparently I need to call their billing team for this - attempted to call today but wait times were +30 mins.Hope this is a warning to others not to use these cowboys.",British Gas
Excellent and professional service from your dedicated team member. Was courteous and friendly and helped me book my emergency plumber appointment with relative ease. Very happy with my BG landlord 'gas cover' service.,British Gas
"The plumber, Blake, was pleasant, efficient and helpful. Clean and tidy, excellent job.  10/10!",British Gas
Proper plumber good work clean exerlant can't complain,British Gas
The person I spoke to took my details and listened to my problem. He then asked if there were any vulnerable people in the house. We discussed my problem in detail and he made an appointment for s plumber to call.,British Gas
Our burst water pipe was repaired and supply restored within 2 hours of our emergency call. The engineer was polite and very professional. Excellent service.,British Gas
We are very satisfied with the advice and recommendations given by the Engineer who visited our property regarding having a Poweflush done.,British Gas
"After Welsh Water told me I had a leak on my property but after investigating for an hour were unable to locate it, I was given 7 days to sort it out myself. I called British Gas who had an engineer from Dyno round the next day. Within minutes of arriving, and without unloading any equipment, they located the problem in my basement, dug out, repaired and made good within an hour. They were very polite and made me feel confident that they could sort out the problem (as opposed to WW who just made me feel like a criminal). Thank you British Gas for this service.",British Gas
The understanding and helpfulness of the advisor on the other end of the phone. Who managed to book me a plumbing appointment promptly whereas I had been unable to do this online,British Gas
Very helpful and polite and kept no mess at all promptly fixed rasiator,British Gas
"Contacted the Dyno-rod service. Blocked land drain. Job will be carried out tomorrow, so no review of chaps doing the work, but the support on the phone was excellent!",British Gas
Rang dyno rod with an emergency and 2 hrs later they arrived ... the young man knew exactly what he was doing and was very efficient and 30 mins later job all done,British Gas
I phoned up to make an appointment for a plumbing leak on my home care agreement and everything went smoothly! We have an appointment arranged for the next day,British Gas
"My complaint is with Dyno. Every time they visit they seem to leave more problems than they solve namely, trashing the house. Building site or someone's home, it's all same to them. This is the third time we've had an issue with British Gas/Dyno. A few years ago an emergency plumber flooded our house, next time they wore protective footwear outside before trailing mud all the way through the house and yesterday they soaked the carpet and left black marks all over the rest of it. This on top of NEVER returning with the right part. occasioning more visits with more opportunity to damage. Not to mention the plumber too afraid to access a concealed cistern because he'd Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnever done one before.' Now British Gas tell me it will take eight weeks to resolve the problem. All I want is my carpet cleaned and left in the state that it was when they arrived.Update 25/1/24 : in response to reply from BG I called in. pointless waste of time nothing can be done until it can be done they said after being passed around 5 different departments.",British Gas
engineer from Dyno Rod  that came to look at an going issue he identified the cause he was very efficient and fixed the issue  his name was Lee Martin and he was very efficient and was very very helpful excellent service,British Gas
"Your man came round, was very polite and very thorough. Said he would set up the next appointment which he did. He also said he would ensure his analysis would be passed on to the next engineer (who attended 25/01/24). The relevant information was not passed on. I doubt this was the fault of the engineer so it looks like a failure in communication between BG and Dyno. It's this kind of thing which gets BG a bad name. I look forward to passing on a very favourable review re today's engineer from Dyno.",British Gas
"Been asked by BG to reveiw there service from the 3 visit that they subbed out to there plumbing dept dyno rod.In genral awful experiances visit 1 plumber didnt have the correct tools for removeing glands from a FRANKE tap, I had to go to the shops and buy the glands ! the most basic job. I had to lend them mine and they still managed to scratch and dent the tap. BR refunded the Â£15 materials only, not the  excess andstill left with a scratch Â£300 tap. Visit 2 ,  leaky stop valve... plumber came and put PTFE tape around it , 1 week later leaking again ( no surpise really)  Complain to BR and asked that a different plumber was sent, gess who turns up. Same guy that scratched my tap and ""fixed"" the valve. He managed to replace the valve ( what he should have done ) but chipped a till in my brand new bathroom, i cant change the 1 till as there is electric underfloor heating so im left with a daily reminder of why I tell everyone I meet to avoid Britsh gas and home care servic and DynoRod",British Gas
Dyno-Rod adviser told Severn Trent Water that the Sewage problem was not ours but theirs after they refused to attend property obtained a reference number and their was no charge off him,British Gas
"Shocking. Our kitchen was left soaked after the engineer visit. The counter was drenched, there was a plug left sitting in water and one of the cupboards was full of water.",British Gas
"Having paid for cover for plumbing for last 10 years, first time used, what a complete shambles, caused I would say by Dyno and British Gas.Toilet flush failed Wednesday about 4.00pm, called B.G. because we only have the one toilet it was flagged as an emergency, plumber would be with us by 10.00pm. No show.Rang following morning at 9.00am, told the information given was wrong would be by 1.00 pm that day. Explained the no one was home until 4.30, rescheduled for late afternoon. Got home at 4.00, card in the door, came at 2.08pm.Phoned again, rescheduled for Saturday between 8.00am and 6.00pm. Stayed in all day rang at 5.00 was told don't worry will be with you before 6.00pm. No Show.Rang again, they contacted the plumber, finished shift at 5.00. Offered to rescheduled call out could be anytime between then and 1.00pm, so could even be 3.00 in the morning. Said I wanted to speak to a manager, went through to register complaint, was told he had to offer compensation, if I rejected then a manager would call, but wouldn't be till Monday. Â£25.00 offered refused and now await a call, mean time contacted a plumber local to us and coming out Tuesday morning.What a complete waste of money we have paid over 10 years. Can't blame the people on the phone but the communication between British Gas and Dyno is shockingly bad. I work for a claims management company and put up a league on social media, customers experiences of poor customer service, guess who is going on the top, god forbid we had a massive water leak. Will I renew, what do British Gas think?UpdateWell that was a waste of time, did as you asked. This is the response I got, when I asked for the cost of employing a private plumber to be refunded to retain my custom. I have been in customer service for years and things go wrong, but customer service is getting it put right. If you need any help with your customer service I will be more than happy to help.Hello Paul . I am sorry to see the above. I am sorry you have not been happy with the service, If this is regarding the excess I am sorry we wouldn't be able to wave this due to the dissatisfaction you are feeling towards the service. Sukhi",British Gas
"Excellent, efficient service. The plumber was very helpful. Explained everything and left everything clean and tidy.",British Gas
"Reported a leak online and someone from Dyno Rod was sent out but he wasn't allowed to touch the filter with the leak, only an engineer can do this!!!Now we have to sit in for another day for an engineer to come out between 8am and 6pm, not happy British Gas!!!",British Gas
"I had to request a plumber for the fourth time, to fix a leak with my outside tap. Today the guy that came out was very polite, worked speedily and thoroughly, left the site in perfect condition and unlike the others didn't take masses of photos.I was so impressed I called his manager to add to the online questionnaire!",British Gas
We had a leak and BG came and fixed it the same day. The engineer was professional and completed the job and explained what he had done .,British Gas

Kept informed of where the engineer was and the engineer fixed leak checked it over and cleaned area before leaving. Super job,British Gas
"Engineer turned up today, refused to do the job. I explained the job on the phone apparently is not covered on the insurance so why did they say that when I made the phone call waste of a day off waste of his time my time scandalousAlso not clear what is what isn't covered on my plumbing apparently everything else, but this how ironic",British Gas
The fitter did an excellent job with the minimal of disruption to our water supply,British Gas

"The engineer was fantastic, the updates on the app not so hot, had a message to review my recent visit followed by one advising the engineer would be late - he'd already been gone an hour.

"Complaint Ref Number: 8016001022 I am writing to you to further add to my complaint (#8016001022). This has caused me immense distress and difficulties. I have a registered disabled mother suffering mental health problems (diagnosed Schizophrenia since 1996) and is also suffering mouth cancer since Jan 2023. The disability has been on your records since I've had my policy with you and the cancer was also reported earlier last year. We should be on the vulnerable list for urgent needs/breakdowns. I called you today 03/02/2024 at 12.02pm to report a problem stating there is no supply of hot or cold water to the taps. The only place where we can get cold water only is the kitchen as that is coming through the mains supply. We cannot use the bath and shower, cannot flush the toilet or use the skinks in the bathrooms. I was told that a Dyno-rod engineer will come to investigate and solve the problem. I called you again at 15:22pm to chase up as nobody had turned up. I was told that a Dyno-rod engineer will be there by 6pm. I called you again at 17:48 and was told it's been one of those days where there are less engineers available but your job is open and an engineer will be coming out to you. I called you again at 19:27 to report that nobody has turned up and logged a complaint to this unacceptable atrocious service provided. I was told nobody is going to come out today as there are no engineers working. This was news to be as I was being told since 12.02pm an engineer is coming and then was told nobody is coming. The kind lady on the phone booked a appoint for me for 04/02/2024 from 8am to 1pm. I have no hopes that anybody is going to come. See call history attached! As a result of your failure to provide a service that I pay for monthly, I've had the following losses and severe problems to the health of a 76 year old disabled and cancer suffering lady: Cancelled Plans for my 6 year old child as I had to stay home all day.Severe anxiety attack to 76 years old cancer suffering and disabled mother Ã¢â‚¬â€œ She has been unable to shower/bath, brush her teeth, keep her mouth clean (considering she has mouth cancer) as there is no hot water.Health Condition worsened for which we've had to call 111, Mount Vernon Hospital (Cancer Treatment) and a paramedic to help her.Urgent need to call out a private plumber to investigate and fix the issue. This has cost me additional money. Invoice is attached.Need to purchase water supplier for upstairs so that we can wipe my mother down and at least give her a sponge bath. Invoice attached. I don't pay you to not provide a service when needed. I demand to be reimbursed for the additional cost implication as result of your failure to provide a service that you get paid for and for the time taken to call you and chase up this issue.",British Gas
ALL VERY PLEASANT AND EASY to request a plumbing repair.,British Gas
Took a long time for our problem to be sorted. 3 times a plumber had to come out. Each time we rang British gas they said the problem had been sorted and the case was closed.,British Gas
Got water leak called them they instructed me what to do to contain leak and prompt appointment for day after engineer to call out has I got learning difficulties Very understanding and very professional company Paul from Abergavenny,British Gas
"We had a water leak in the house. British Gas sent engineer on the same day. Leak sorted out quickly. Lights were fixed by other engineer next day. Both are very knowledgeable and helpful in sorting the issues without delay. Overall very satisfied and was a positive experience. When British Gas employees/engineers come to fix they call promptly, they come on time and fix the issues. I did not had a good experience with third party guys that British Gas sends for boiler servicing every year. They don't turn up for appointments. ",British Gas

Time scale of booking an engineer was within the same hour of him arriving. He sorted out the mess Dyno had made yesterday (23/02/2024) for us. Excellent service.,British Gas
"Terrible service!!! Extremely disappointed. After waiting in during my allotted booking time and taking time out of work they changed my time with no notice, when I called the office they weren't bothered at all and didn't even apologise. Finally when the engineer came out the tap was not like for like and even he agreed wouldn't work on my sink, this now meaning I've wasted 2 afternoons off work for nothing. I pay a premium rate to ensure these things are taken care of and this has been appalling from start to finish. To add insult to injury I'm now being chased to pay an excess on a service that has caused me nothing but agro lost me 2 afternoons of work when I am self employed and I still have a broken tap",British Gas
Service carried out efficiently and came back today (26/2/24) to fit a new radiator because of a leaking old one ,British Gas
We have home insurance unfortunately with British Gas and I DO NOT Recommend them. They throw a company that is useless called dyno. Who are incompetent. My entire house flooded and ceiling collapsed and British Gas had no idea what to do. Then they said they will send dyno out. Who then went to the complete wrong address. Warning! Do not use British Gas as insurance! Rubbish scammers. I have way more horror experiences with them but I would be typing a novel then.,British Gas

"DO NOT PAY for HOMECARE PLUMBING- 3rd time using pipe under kitchen sink leaking . DYNO plumber turns up , says he fixed it . Stood there and said Ã¢â‚¬Ëœoh yeah there's still water but that's where I didn't wipe it should be ok Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ . He left pipe is still leaking worse than before . 1st time I used took 4 visits to fix a toilet leak . 2nd time used they created a leak that wasn't there before and now this. Raised a complaint will now cancel cover . Having to put a towel and kitchen towel whilst wait for 2nd visit . My response from British Gas to this post yesterday is  I now have to hunt round all the social media sites to talk to them privately they couldn't even give me an email address or contact number . Awful . 2nd plumber  visit due today didn't happen as planned they cancelled on me . I've had 3 conversations with British Gas and 1 with DYNO all awful incompetence and false promises   . I'm going away on holiday  tomorrow so their recommendation is to turn  the water off or get my sister from Essex to give up her weekend and stay in my property 8-6pm in case a plumber turns up . What a wonderful home care service . I'm going to cancel all cover gas electrics and plumbing as would rather use check a trade and pay a bit more for a qualified professional tradesman who will turn up on time and  not leave me home in a worse position than it was before .

Problem with foul sewer drainage - British Gas information shows cover is up to the main sewer connection - but this is the case. They do not cover problems cause by dips in the pipework or the chambers. B Gas need to clarify this on the publicity ,British Gas
"Greg, my engineer, was great. He identified and fixed my leaking tank very quickly, cleaned up, and was polite and friendly. My day had started badly by finding water coming onto the bathroom ceiling but now only five hours later it's all fixed. Thank you",British Gas
"I have been told I have to wait 3 weeks for a plumber to come and fix my leak!In the meantime my property is getting damaged. Awful landlord homecare service!I wrote a review on trustpilot 2 days ago and they replied saying they were sad to hear this and call BG.I did and they said the quickest they can get someone is 3 weeks away.Save your money and don't take out BG landlord services as it's a waste of money.To BG, don't reply to this review telling me to call someone. You have my details and if you were shocked by this service you would get in touch with me and arrange a sooner appointment. Why should my property get damaged because you can't find a plumber sooner! That's the whole point of having a landlord homecare service????Spoke to Wendy at BG and nothing they can do.To make things worse, BG have just told me that the homecare team are closed at the weekend. So no one can help you if you have a leak at the weekend anyway. Seriously!",British Gas
Great service and quick appt for a radiator leak. Also good to speak to a real person and not a chat online.,British Gas
Easy to contact and a quick response with Dyno being out within the hour - he was here for well over 2 hours and has done a great job - thank you,British Gas
"Easy to book a repair in online, phoned before arrival. Explaining everything that caused the leak. Very caring snd professional engineer. Wearing shoe covers all the time. Fixed problem and tested the system and didn't leave until they were satisfied everything was working okay. ",British Gas
"I first contacted British gas last August about a leak. A good start as the Dyno plumber turned up quickly. After an hour or so he said he didn't have the time to investigate further and would be back. A week later I had to contact British gas to see what was happening. A week or so later the plumber returned but with no success. On the 6th visit the plumber decided he would have to divert the pipework as the leak was underground. In total it took about 7 weeks to fix. My walls were getting wetter and wetter and full of mould. As it was finally fixed I paid the Â£60 owed on the 2nd of October and thought that was the end of the matter. I was not that happy with the service and the length of time it took but was glad it was over, or so I thought. Today I had another invoice for Â£60. Having contacted the chat system I was diverted to the phone number. The agent informed me that there was 2 invoices as I contacted British gas twice. What a con. Trying to sort it out is awful. I'm just passed from 1 number to another. There is no email address just a postal one. Beware of contacting them more than once for the same problem. You may well be charged twice. Absolute disgrace ",British Gas
"British gas was amazing, and I am extraordinarily grateful to the man who came. He was so friendly and helpful. He identified a burst pipe, and kindly gave me some advice as to what to do next. Exceptional service. ",British Gas
Really pleased with fast efficient service by a caring engineer. Sorted out the drain on our sink. First Class ,British Gas

Tap couldn't be fixed as pipe had corroded in sink. Needed a new sink which was fitted a week later. Unfortunately the hot tap had no pressure so they now need to come back again. ,British Gas
"My radiator lockshield valve spindle was leaking. British Gas Dynorod engineer was an hour late, sent from too far away! He thought he could tighten a spindle sealing nut on a non-serviceable sealed for life valve! He didn't have a new valve on board and had another job to attend and so called a local Dynorod colleague and then left. Another engineer finally arrived, having only a thermostatic valve on board and used that to replace my lockshield valve, so making conventional radiator balancing impossible. He also left both the valve and my wall in a dirty condition.",British Gas
"Advisor very helpful, gave me her full attention and advised me on an issue that was bugging me but not the immediate task as well. Very efficient.(11/3/24, a plumbing job)",British Gas
I have a comprehensive service contract with them which covers me for gas pipes drainage and electrics.its handy to have in case of an emergency as with your own house anything can happen and if you are a woman with no tradesperson experience on fixing things this policy for service contract with a reliable company is paramount.,British Gas
" I contacted British Gas a couple of weeks ago regarding an issue at my above property where by the managing agent had contacted yourselves to get an appointment for a burst pipe in the loft and was told my policy doesn't cover it which it definitely does. She then called out a third party plumber at the cost of Â£180, I did inform her I definitely had cover for pipe work to which she called yourselves and was then told I did, I believe am entitled to a reinburstment for the Â£180, I understand there has been futher communication between yourselves and my managing agent and you guys don't seem to want to reimburse the Â£180 and are being difficult about this. I am highly disappointed and very upset by this considering I have 3 properties with yourselves? totally unacceptable on your part. If I don't receive the Â£180 I will be forced to take this matter further ",British Gas
"Not happy with BG at present. I have a full home service package to include boiler, water and electrics. Â£60 excess on each repair. Called them out for a leaking tap. It was not fixed yet they now hound me for the Â£60, threatening debt collectors etc. I have checked their terms and conditions and the Â£60 excess is only payable on a completed repair, therefore they have no right to ask for the payment, let alone threaten and treat it as a debt. Have spoken to customer services who were pretty unhelpful and still I continue to be hounded for a payment I do not owe! On the verge of making a formal complaint!",British Gas
Easy to contact on phone didn't wait in a queue. Within 2 hours of reporting leak plumbing engineer under Homecare arrived. Impressed that call out happened so efficiently. Hopefully they can repair.,British Gas

We have been British Gas customers for years but recently had a radiator replaced in our lounge but unfortunately and disappointing to have Dyno Rod in to replace it. The first visit was to assess the job and four days later two engineers arrived in separate vans and took nearly all day to complete the work.,British Gas
Dyno rod and Wayne thank you again.   You saved my bacon yesterday with the drain issue happy to pay 180 pounds because he was such a nice guy did the job well. Would have him back again. Hopefully not needed tho.     Whole thing from beginning to end was brilliant I have to say.   Just 3 ish hour from call to done.      Now our new carpets won't be damaged from outside.  Like I said life saver. ,British Gas
The person was helpful in dealing with our enquiry. The plumber came out on the same day.  Extremely happy with the service.,British Gas
I am seriously in awe. I have level 2 house insurance. I went on line on Wednesdaybto report a minor leak. They offered an appointment the next day which I couldn't be there. They came 2 days later and fixed it within 10 minutes. 30 minutes later another crew came along to fix the necessary damage to the wall. Amazing service ,British Gas
My call to Dyno rod was very satisfying. The response was immediate and a convenient appointment  was made.The engineer turned up on time and  carried out a thorough check.Made an appointment  to carry out the work.,British Gas
This is a review on my British Gas customer service experience. (They're sending Dynorod to fix the leaking valve tomorrow so I can't comment on the actual repair service yet.)I did try to use the online ap to book a repair but it told me I had to phone. I was dreading it because I thought I'd have to go through loads of various options - either pressing buttons or (even worse) having to talk responses into my phone and then I would either be speaking to a machine or a call centre in India or somesuch. The call was answered much quicker than I was expecting and the advisor was simply lovely to talk to. He was very sympathetic and helped me to book an appt as quickly as possible. I couldn't be more impressed with the service. I can't tell you how good it was to talk to a) a human and b) someone in this country with an accent that I understood who wasn't reading from a script. The experience was very refreshing and I truly appreciated this service. My advisor was wonderful ????,British Gas
"The worst company I had to deal with .On behalf of my landlord which has home care insurance it took them from January to April and 4 different "" enginers "" visits to finally fix a leaking tap .The amount of excuses and nonsense was unreal .Avoid it at all costs ",British Gas

They  failed to change a tap in my 2 in 1 toilet & sink , caused damages to my internal plumbing, broken pipes, left me with no toilet as stopped working.

Lost 8 days of work with different appointments and failing to fix the damage they caused . How can a plumber fail to change a tap??",British Gas
No effort made to stop the leakSites some pipes as metal So won't touch itThe leak was from a rubber joint What is the point in having a plumbing contract with British Gas Plumer wanted about Â£300 to repair the leakA conWaste of time Despite explaining Not interested.,British Gas
I find that British Gas is a company I can trust. Recently I had an insurance claim for the main water pipe to my property. I contacted British Gas and informed them   From then on everything went smoothly until the job was completed. First class service. What I also find comforting is the fact that if British Gas has a better tariff than the one I am on. They give me a choice of better tariffs and allow me to change without a penalty. ,British Gas
Let me just state the 5 stars are not for British gas there for the engineer penny who they sent she was in a different van and contracts for them the actual British gas blue van engineers I give a 0 3 different men in British gas vans come this week not even in my house for more than. 5 min not one of them fixed my radiator leak what now has destroyed my wooden floor its black an rotten off the water and is black destroyed of water the lady penny who come today is better than any of there engineers and stayed over a hour she found the problem a cracked bolt and changed everything the British gas men just put some tape over it and left it to leak this company a one big disgrace my 5 stars are to the lady who come for them but from a different company shes made a show of there engineers and done the job properly ,British Gas

Engineer was very pleasant but unable to carry out the work. Do taps not have washers now which can be replaced or tightened? You do not offer a good range of taps as replacements so am not happy with your service for the amount of money I pay. ,British Gas
Gas engineer helpful and pleasant as always.The service contract I have now cancelled due to huge cost increase.   Have needed to call upon assistance once - 3 years ago in more than 5 years since appliance was installed by Scottish gas.  Have always had a comprehensive drains plumbing electrical cover- not particularly cheap but apparently reassuring! The reason given for the price hike was this Ã¢â‚¬Å“historicÃ¢â‚¬Â call upon the policy(which also requires additional payment -a surcharge for each aspect of service)I am returning to my longstanding plumber for a more realistic service.,British Gas
"Replaced radiator valvesarrived on time, very efficient, left every in original condition.",British Gas

"The only time, in years of subscription, that I needed help with a water leak, it was impossible to contact an emergency engineer.Automated online reporting was completely useless and there was no-one to call on the phone.

"THIS IS NOT AN EMERGENCY SERVICE!I have been paying for British Gas Homecare for over 10 years now. Every single month I pay on time, and now that their ""emergency"" service was put to the test they have failed terribly. I had a busted pipe in my bathroom after 10pm and I had a waterfall in my kitchen below, so had to turn off the mains water - which means I have had no water, no toilet for several hours. I tried to book an emergency appointment online, but was instructed to call a number to book - which I did. Spoke to a woman who attempted to book an ""emergency"" appointment for the NEXT DAY but she couldn't take the payment. You could tell she wasn't used to the system. So I called again and spoke to someone who booked an ""emergency"" appointment, only to realise at 9am the next morning on calling DYNO, that it was not booked as an ""emergency"". So had to call BG again to book another ""emergency"" but after 9am DYNO engineers are all booked for the day so had to wait several more hours to hear from them. Incompetence all around.BG, there's no one to hold you accountable, so you continue to scrape us for ongoing increasing premiums every month for NO 24/7 Emergency service!Well, it's my money and I'll take it elsewhere.  I left your gas company a few years go because of your appalling customer service. Why did I think your Homecare would have been any better? Lessons learnt.If you're reading this and have any doubt - STAY FAR AWAY FROM BRITISH GAS!",British Gas

Today I called British gas to make some enquires and book an appointment. I first talked to a gentleman called Eian .

"I insured my drainage, toilet and boiler with British Gas. It happened in December  2022 there was a blockage in my toilet upstairs which I called them. I was warned not to get an external plumber. B.Gas canceled the appointment 3 times as there was a leakage of poo water coming dowing to my kitchen. it damages the roof and inside the kitchen cupboards. The smell was terrible in the house. The poo came out of bathtup and sink upstair. I continued to call them as they told me that the job is not priority since I have another toilet downstair. I made several calls as I was upset seen poo water in my kitchen I was kept cleaning up I have to give up as my kitchen cupboard was peeling and dislocating as the poo smell was unbearable. Now they were able to stop the leakage too late they are passing me from one staff to another and claimed that they had closed my case without paying me the compensation I deserved. British Gas is a big time disappointing and unreliable  ",British Gas

British Gas repaired with a new replacement and acknowledgement of the fault. I have been waiting over two years for repairs to be completed. I spent best part of 3 months looking for replacement tiles etc as they would not repair the damages to the tiles on replacement of repairing the damage. Every week i get someone in their complaints team telling repairs are being organised. I had 4 contactors and surveyors look at the property. They have claimed this off their insurers but yet have not resolved my issue. Getting know where. Next stage is to email the CEO.,British Gas

We had the British gas emergency cover for plumbing and draining which is contracted out to dynamo. The customer service is so poor. Unable to get through to British gas and it's even harder to get through to dynamo. When we did the engineers that came were rude and refused to complete the job.

I rang Dynorod to ask for a quote for fitting new bath taps. The adviser I spoke to was very polite and helpful. He organised a plumber to come round to my house to give a no obligation quote.

The plumber was friendly and did a great job. We are happy with the result. ,British Gas
It took 48 days to sort out a leak from our soil pipe which had been caused by Dyno Rod fixing another leak. Kept sending out engineers instead of ground crew who had not been told what the job was. Then I was told that categorically the leak could not have been caused by them putting a cctv in the pipe. I never said it was. Keep emailing BG to get a report from Dyno Rod.  Was told I would have it by the end of the week. Still waiting. Just to add insult to injury BG have upped my insurance as they had carried out work on my property!!,British Gas

"The guy came out when others wouldn't he knew is stuff and told me why my shower pumps kept failing..it was down incorrect fitting and he told me how it should be fitted, so yes he was very helpful and I can't thank him enough.",British Gas
"This was the first time I had used British Gas Homecare to rectify a small leak in the toilet drainage.   I was impressed by the next day booking, the telephone advice before arrival of rhe plumber and the efficient correction of the fault leaving no debris.   Excellent service",British Gas
"Easy to get appointment and arrive on time.I have a re-occurring drain problem, it is great having British Gas (Dyno Rod) cover which means I can get a drain engineer out quickly so fix the problem.  Normally can get either same day or next day appointment.  The engineer always calls to say they are on their way and fix the problem quickly with no fuss.  ",British Gas
"Our pipes were making a gurgling noise. The British Gas engineers were excellent. They came the very next day, sorted out the issue and gave us excellent advice to switch our central heating on once a month during the summer and let the radiators heat up, which will stop air building in the pipes. ",British Gas
Explained what problem was and what is needed to fix issue and why it should be done system was blocked and power flush required to fix problem ,British Gas
Excellent service carried out by polite professional engineers takes all the worry out of trying to find a plumber if anything goes wrong,British Gas
Came out as soon as possible and fixed the blockage and got us back washing our clothes ,British Gas
Booked engineer for leaking tap. Engineer arrived said he didn't have o rings to fix tap. Suggested replacing with new one. Second engineer arrived to replace tap left with pull out faucet not working. Not impressed.Don't do Facebook or twitter so can't reply to your answer ,British Gas
The plumber identified the problem immediately and fixed the problem in 20 minutes,British Gas
"Contacted BG Homecare about a problem with contaminated water supply.After 2 visits by Dyno the problem was diagnosed as a problem with the mains water supply pipe within my house boundary and that it needed replacing.BG said that as the pipe was not burst or leaking it was not covered by my Homecare agreement.As we do not have any clean,safe drinking water we are drinking bottled water and trying to find somebody to replace the pipe at my cost unless it bursts in the meantimeWhat is the point of having a  Homecare contract.Thank you BG.",British Gas
"British Gas/ Dynorod engineer came to fix a blockage, damaged the pipes, they sent another plumber to fix the pipe, cracked my sink.  As soon as we tried to use the dishwasher, the pipes fell apart.  I  called the home care and the advisor was so hostile even asked whether I own the property.  They are sending another engineer tomorrow.  We are unable to use our kitchen for the past 5 days after paying so much for the homecare insurance.  Please avoid British gas homecare by all means.  They are not competent in any way. After this, I am changing my homecare service provider.  They don't deserve any star",British Gas
Was very helpful and quick to fix down stairs toilet as sometimes can't get upstairs due to back problems ,British Gas
"British Gas sub their central heating repairs to Dyno Rodney, seems British Gas only service boilers and do basic repairs, so seeing my contract is with BG, it is BG I have the complaint with although it is Dyno Rodney who have caused all the problems, although I believe they are one and the same company.So here we go, Dyno Rodney turned up for the third time this morning to fit a new tank, 12 days after our copper hot water cylinder split, they then sent a fourth engineer out late morning on the same day with an incorrect size replacement cylinder, too small. Plonkers! This is despite me insisting on the phone prior to fitting that it needs to be like for like, and they assured me it would be, but will be a few days because they need to order a special one accordingly.Because of this cock up we will have been without hot water for over two weeks by the time I can get them back to fit the correct size cylinder, which transpires is actually a standard size cylinder so we didn't need to get one specially made in the first place, it was an off the shelf item all the time. Plonkers!Our first major Homecare claim in 16 years of paying in for repairs and so far it doesn't look worth it. Would have been better off putting it aside every month and getting a reputable local plumbing and heating firm in.Latest update.Official complaint in hand with BG. Appears the third engineer we had out on the morning of 5th of August forgot to close a hot tap he opened on the bath, presumably to drain pipework before he cut the hot feed in the airing cupboard, this hot tap is connected to a mixer shower head on the bath taps (big white thing on the taps would be quite obvious one would have thought) this has now resulted in another large escape of water, this time from the large bore hot pipe they cut open in the airing cupboard to remove the old tank, (which was swiftly put in the back of a van with other copper scrap) because the cold water went straight through the hot mixer tap that Dyno Rodney left open on the bath when my wife was attempting to wash her hair in cold water over the bath again for the 10th day on the trot-ters. What happened is the cold water come out the large bore hot pipe he cut off in the airing cupboard to take the old tank out and cold water came down through the hall ceiling at full mains pressure. This is the second leak Dyno Rodney have caused, resulting in further damage to our hall ceiling without even having restored the hot water yet. Definitely a waste of money paying in for repairs the last 16 years, on this occasion they have caused a damn sight more harm than good. It should have been a straightforward cylinder swap.DYNO RODNEY YOU PLONKERS!",British Gas
The agent rang to let me know he would be arriving which was veryuseful.  He completed the job very quickly and I was pleased to find I have a new fitting in my bath.Thank you.,British Gas
well for past two years calling you out to relight pilot light on fire my policy increased not bad for ten minute job also when having to call you out for a jammed main stop cock using a mains stop key ( 4 foot long tee bar) to free it left me with a now badly dripping tap which because under units never seen water build up. so now saving to afford next policy increase so able to call you out again to fix that  ,British Gas
Engineer came out as quick as he could to sort the radiator that had fallen off the wall and was flooding my room very pleased he managed to stop it even tho he couldn't fix it back on as it was on the wrong brackets and need extra work done in wall,British Gas
"The engineers arrived on time, were polite and kept me informed, they did an excellent job of changing the washer on my bathroom tap. All good, excellent service.",British Gas
"I recently had a plumber from Dyno with my Home Serv contract. I have been a customer of British Gasfor over 60 years and this is the first time I have been very unhappy with the service from your call desk personnel. I reported a leak in my bathroom where the water was coming through the ceiling, a very nice engineer came out to have a look but could not find the fault!! He told me to call back if it happened again, well it happened again so I phoned again only to be told that as I had another bathroom to use that and a plumber would be with me in 5 days time but I still had water coming through my ceiling especially if I turned a specific tap on!! The plumber who came out did eventually find the fault and repaired it he was very efficient and very sympathetic he told me I should never have been made to wait that long especially as I am 84 and vulnerable and have a contract to cover this problem.?",British Gas
I Have never given less than 5 stars but on this occasion British gas were let down by Dyno I had a leaking pipe in the utility it had flooded the floor and the man came within hours and said he had fixed it no problem ..I left a bowl under the pipe just in case within an hour the bowl was full  I called again and another plumber came and said he had fixed it but yet again when he'd gone within a short time the bowl was full ..One the third occasion the plumber said he didn't know what the others had done as the pipe had a split in it and he changed the whole pipe ..the first 2 were only in the house 10 mins and didn't log or photograph their work but the third one did everything and was there about an hour ..this is the first time I have ever had a problem  British Gas always gets a 5 star for their Homecare .,British Gas
"90 Year old widow living alone paying Â£700 plus pa for cover. Reported small water leak copper pipe in airing cupboard on 3 Aug, earliest available appointment 9 Aug, but after waiting all day engineer did not turn up or make contact. Contacted online on 10 Aug to find out why no show to be informed the appointment had been rescheduled for 16 Aug, but managed to negotiate for engineer to visit that day. The engineer attended but wasnt equipped to fix/replace copper pipes! so assigned the job to dyno rod who would be in touch, and for some reason isolated boiler. After not hearing anything further by late afternoon 12 Aug , rang to chase and told an engineer would attend next day which they did and replaced the pipe and joint. PM 14 Aug noticed there was no hot water and the boiler still appears to be isolated, contacted online and told earliest possible appointment is evening of 15 Aug. This level of service is a complete disgrace and now desperate to find an alternative service supplier. 910013024888Thank you for your reply, I believe the answer is in your power, without me reverting to social media, fix the issue now, investigate how this debacle happened and take actions to avoid it happening again, then consider refunding some of the absurd premium paid.",British Gas
"Disappointed that no one from the customer service team came back to me to follow up my complaint. Â£60 withdraw from my account which was surprisingly given the complaint was still ongoing! I would have checked that as a customer I was happy with this given the cancelled appointments, inconvenience and lack of reliability of the plumber from Dyno attending appointments on time. A discount or even refund under the circumstances should have been offered and discussed as a courtesy. I had to pay Â£80 to an external emergency plumber even though I have British Gas home care to cover this. Their own plumber  did not attend my appointments to fix this so why bother having insurance ? I have had to work the next 3 weekends to make for the sessions I booked off to let the plumber in who never showed up! The plumber who came was excellent. I have nothing but praise for him and his work. He was clear, professional and very good at his job, I applaud him. It's such a shame the organisation can't organise themselves better to get the best out of their clearly highly skilled staff and they have such poor follow up processes for complaints. ",British Gas
Whole process from start to finish was executed faultlessly. Our plumber Pete and electrician Adam worked really hard to deliver an excellent install.,British Gas
"We also have engineering cover that includes plumbing , where they use Dynarod who are also brilliant, along with British Gas engineers. I do not the like the using contractor element, in general, as prefer BG people themselves for the gas and boiler issues.",British Gas
I gave 3* because we had an ongoing problem with d/stairs toilet. After calling a plumber out 4 times they could not solve the problem. We ended up calling a local plumber out ourselves and he solved the problem immediately. So having had to pay out for getting a plumber in to fix the problem we then saw our Homecare cover had gone up this year because of multiple callouts.While I agree the premium should go up when you have call-outs I don't think it should apply when engineers/plumbers don't fix the problem.,British Gas
"I reported my toilet handle broken ,, they came out changed handle and insides of cistern.

"I have very bad experience with British Gas HomeCare, they use Dyno-Rod/Met Serve Ltd as local company to address to my D2 discharge pipe maintenance request (DY-WO-3872664).  The first repair visit took place in February 2024. Despite multiple visits by different team and a significant delay, the issue remained unresolved till May 2024.  The inconsistent advice provided by the team, coupled with the eventual sadly decision not to proceed with the repair, has been a highly unsatisfactory experience to me.  They left without carrying out any repair work but just leaving my ceiling being cut open.  It seems to me that the visits were not aiming in finding the right way to clear the blockage, but just looking for the excuse to say that this is not covered by the policy - they saying that the discharge pipe was not properly mounted therefore needed to be replaced.I tried many time to ask for help from British Gas HomeCare support team, unfortunately they can't do anything to resolve my case, only suggested me to speak directly to the local plumbing office, saying that only the local office can decide what is covered or not under the policy, and only them can discuss with me if I feel the diagnosis was incorrect.  At the end I have to pay a third party who have the right tool (DEWALT Drain Snake Kit) and experience to clear the blockage without replacing the discharge pipe. This confirms with my comment that Dyno-Rod/Met Serve Ltd misdiagnosed the problem - this is not a build quality issue but just a simply discharge pipe blockage issue.",British Gas
"I contacted British Gas as part of my Home Care Policy with them, to attend and repair a leak in the sink tap fixture.

Reluctantly told me about gas pipe AFTER I smelt gas, never told us about the crushed water pipe! Couldn't wait to leave our property, absolutely no interest worse than cowboys!!!!! Rang British gas to report it and they didn't even class it as an emergency. Will definitely be leaving British gas. Crap, crap, crap. Complete waste of money, complete joke!

Extremely  thorough  and solved my shower problem,British Gas
The engineer was extremely helpful and sorted out my leak effectively.,British Gas
"We had a leak from a radiator where the pipe connected to the radiator. Your engineer told us that the problem was the steel pipe which was not covered by our insurance, He quoted a cost of Â£400 to repair this.

Bringing people out who  knows what they  are doing who are tidy and efficient.   They  do their job with all the knowledge they need and want and the same goes for the  advisors as well.

If I could leave a 0 star I would ??Absolutely shocking customer service, I reported a leak and was told it would be classed as an emergency and they would be here in 4 hours. After numerous calls and 8 hours later the engineer finally turned up. Customer service just lied and fobbed me off. Communication skills from the reps is extremely poor. I've raised this issue before but their communication skills have NOT gotten any better.However the engineer who attended my property was polite, knowledgable and honest,British Gas please send your customer reps to learn customer service skills, Communication is a very big MUST in a company,",British Gas
Arrived quickly and solved the blockage within 20mins,British Gas

"Good service but overpriced.  You pay Â£60 excess, then they've put the premium by Â£60 because I called them out once to a leaking shutoff valve, so basically I've paid Â£120 for a job that took 30mins. ",British Gas
Absolutely dreadful service two plumbers came out to fix leak in shower both changed washers that didn't need replacing and actually made leak worse.  To compound it was charged twice by British Gas for work that didn't need doing and not fixed.  Had to pay 3rd time to pay for plumber to fix leak.  ,British Gas
We called out an engineer to are toilet which was not working as normal the plumber arrive realised he needed the drain engineer he called that department and with an hour he came and rectified the problem he certainly was professional and helpful great job.,British Gas

"I wasn't home during british gas team visit, family member in. I don't feel the job is done very well. My family member said the engineer only took a few minutes with the job. Nothing explained what's done. It was my toilet handle, it doesn't feel like it's securely fitted in, and it feel like it's very loose. This cost me Â£50 excess for not a good job. I feel like its to be corrected for another visit but I can't afford to pay Â£50 in a short period time, but this is the engineer responsibility for making sure the customer is satisfied with the job before leaving.",British Gas
Unfortunately bathroom taps are still dripping. New washers have not done the job.  You have to turn hot tap about 7 times before water comes out.. I shall be ringing to report it again. ,British Gas

"Plumber was good. However the toilet leaked whilst being changed, onto the lounge ceiling. Made plumber aware and he informed his manager. I was promised a callback today.

"I have homecare cover and it is a total waste of money. We reported a bad leak in our property 2 weeks ago when we discovered a flood in the floor. They sent a heating engineer who doesn't sort leaks but he reported back to Dyna Rod that it required a leak detector team. After chasing again I was told a leak detection person would arrive in the next few days, they turned up and it was a boiler engineer! He said it was typical of Dyna Rod to lie and that they don't have a leak detection team any more - apparently they have all left. I call British Gas again and they just say to go back to Dyna Rod. After waiting in a queue for ages I get hold of a person who tells me he will have to get a contracted out team to come - said he'd call me in a couple of days to confirm. No call. I call again and get hold of the same guy and say why didn't you call me you had promised me you would. He said I can't sort it for you!Management won't agree to do so! He told me that the only way to get my leak resolved would be to complain- I said are you seriously telling me that your bosses won't sort my leak? I'm furious by this time and for two weeks we've had no hot water or heating and the floor damage has got worse by the day. The solid oak floorboards are all curling up! I get an agent on chat to complainafter more than an hour I am given a telephone number to call. Dyna Rod! I'm told that it will definitely be sorted. I try calling this morning and the number doesn't work!!!!! (I kept the chat so if anyone is reading this from BG I think that your service and customer care is a big fat zero!

Three times i have been cut off or told to call or told someone would call me back. I had a plumber come out from British gas who refused to do a job because my boiler was in the attic. I had pay a call out fee for this. The gas man was unsure of a problem but since the radiator was repaired the sink makes noises and I get a bad smell when the boiler comes on.

It's like there's no water in the sink and when the heating comes on water also seems to run down from somewhere. Originally, you would hear the odd trickle but since the repair you can hear more than a trickle(them) I can book the job for you but it won't be covered, please try to understand(me) I am but i don't understand what isn't covered(them) If you have more query you can directly connect with our team member from calling department.Here is the contact number so that you can also reach out to them directly over the calls through Telephone Number:0333 200 8899(me) Please may you tell me what's not covered,the problem has resulted since someone repaired the radiator(them) I would request you to please call on the number they will assist you on this.(me) I am guessing i will have to explain everything all over again(them) I'm sorry we haven't fully lived up to the service you'd expect from us, I'll be sure to pass your feedback on so that we can do better going forward.

I was disappointed that the Dyno person deployed by British Gas - they tried to manipulate the situation and ask for Â£100 cash.

I then came out of the house which they were not expecting the younger person who he did not know was home  and he was shocked so then back tracked and advised it's ok I've done the work told your dad he didn't have to pay so no need to pay him. I had questioned who asks for Â£100 cash in this day and age when most companies have card readers. Happy that the work was done but it does make me wonder how many elder humans are being taken advantage of. In a world of camera doorbells do not try and pull the wool over our eyes - I watched the whole conversation as it had happened so you cannot lie your way out of it! ,British Gas
Nice guy very polite fixed the pipe that's was loose ,British Gas

Process of claim completed and efficientlyResolved issues of  of down pipe leak,British Gas
The engineer from Dyno Rod was great but having a appointment time of between 8am and 6 pm is not acceptable. We waited in all day and the engineer did not arrive until 6pmThe appointment times need to be much shorter e.g 8am -1pm or 1pm-6pm.,British Gas
"Expected a short wait for a plumber to call, but was given a date for two days after my phones call ,which was much sooner than I expected. Plumber arrived on time, quickly analysed the problem. Very efficient and friendly Very pleased. ",British Gas

I can unreservedly recommend British Gas and their Services.A big thank you for the way every aspect of my emergency was handled ?? ",British Gas
"Negotiate for better deal, if you have a problem you may have to be persist to get help, and may need to find the right arrangement of words to get to get someone to fix a leak dropping though my kitchen ceiling. Age and infirmity do not seem to be a consideration. The plumber when he did come was intelligent and very efficient a credit his craft.",British Gas
My shower (not electric) started to leak from the pipe into the shower.   The plumber came and stopped the leak but had to break around the pipe to access it.   Said he could not replace the shower as the wall around the pipe needed repairs and said that British gas would not do this work so I have  been left with a hole in the wall and two capped of pipes I don't consider this a completed job but no one will take responsibility so I am left with no .useable water ,British Gas
You increased my cover by Â£200 about 25% what happened to under 2% inflation I'm a pensioner who's been with you  about 17 year and due to this increase have had to go to basic cover and move plumbing to Yorkshire water,British Gas
It took 5 weeks for a burst radiator to be replaced. Damaged replace the radiator was not ordered and 2 appointments therefore cancelled. I had to phone Dyno twice to say not to attend and someone from BG told me a radiator had been sent and signed for when it had not. All the fitters were excellent but overall a poor experience,British Gas
Excellent staff at British Gas and contractor Dennis was so professional sorted out my plumbing issues beautifully thank you British Gas team your hard work is appreciated.,British Gas
My plumber was Jay H. He was on time provided good advice to help me solve the issue and overall was very professional.,British Gas
"The plumber's visit was remarkable. Their diligence was evident in the meticulous way they approached the job. They provided clear explanations for each step of the process, ensuring I understood what was being done and why. It was a professional and thorough service.",British Gas
"Called out Dyno to fix a leak under the sink and to replace an isolation valve on the cold feed to the dishwasher. Plumber kept us informed when he was arriving which was going to be at the end of the booked slot. Plumber changed the isolation valve, but the waste pipework under the sink was not compliant. He had to pick up a waste pipework kit from a local merchant. Great service - thanks BG.",British Gas
One of my radiators was leaking and because I've got plumbing cover (with a Â£50 excess) I was able to request a visit from Dyna-rod to fix it & the plumber visited the next day (earlier than I was expecting). The engineer spent a really long time sorting the problem out with the radiator and checked everything was fine before he left. I have the excess as this lowered my monthly payment by quite a lot and pretty sure a plumber would've charged me a lot more than Â£50 to fix my radiator. I've had no problem since his visit.,British Gas
"He fixed a problem that had been identified on the previous visit. He also said that a steel pipe should be changed for a current plastic one and will arrange for someone to contact me to arrange an appointment. Very happy with your service, thank you. ",British Gas
Same day call-out. Engineer arrived on time and spent time testing for the leak and then replaced pipe work. Very competent and professional. ,British Gas
Professional and got the job done! Vicky was great and spotted a leak which over time would have been dangerous- nice to see more female engineers. Would recommend British Gas to family and friends. ,British Gas

We had a leak in our bathroom Called BGArrived on time and was very helpful and knowledgeable we was very happy with the service,British Gas
A problem with bathroom basin draining into toilet. The engineer diagnosed the problem and cleared it. There is an on going problem where we had a block which was cleared. Then some pipe work was done. When the block happened again the engineer said the pipe work needed changing. This was deemed unnecessary by the plumber who came out. This time drain engineer was surprised it hadn't been changed. The bendy pipe dips. I am happy with service but paying more because of call outs for same problem?,British Gas
Very easy to book. The service was booked for the next day. The engineer phoned to say he was on his way. He was polite and friendly and did all the work necessary in no time at all. I would recommend BG all the time for the ease and convenience of getting a plumber and plumbing jobs done. We've had the HomeCare service for a number of years and have not looked back. ,British Gas
"My mother has not long come of hospital and in her 80's.  Her toilet  is leaking water and she has been up all night with buckets emptying the water. A British Gas engineer was booked but was cancelled due to an emergency!!!! When I rang her I was told it was booked for a week later!!!! I rang British Gas who could not even find a visit booked! ( please review conversation) and I had to ring dino rod who was really helpful. I also belong to  British Gas breakdown and took a day off work for a plumbing issue and it was cancelled on the day, what do you think about the service provided?",British Gas
My experience with British Gas was excellent. A plumber arrived at my house 40 minutes after I called the Honecare service on a Saturday. I needed a follow up visit two later and the plumber arrived a little after 8am. All is good now and I have peace of mind ahead of the coming winter months.,British Gas
"The engineer arran was amazing he was very friendly and extremely professional in the work he had to carry out at my home,I had a pipe that's was leaking which he replaced,He was understanding that I had my autistic son at home he was very clean and tidy, he cleaned up after himself and was very respectful to the home and family,arran is a credit to PH jones and has shown how respectful he is to the company he works for.outstanding work.

Dynod came and sorted a blocked drain. Quick and easy to arrange and done well.  ,British Gas
"Normally very good for emergencies and come out quickly but on this occasion I requested to have a radiator moved. Price agreed and booked appointment, waited in all day and never turned up, no notification from them, so I called and arranged another appointment. Same story again, didn't turn up and heard nothing from them, no contact at all. So found a local plumber and they were amazing and cheaper, so worked in my favour in the end.",British Gas
"Booked an appointment last week with British Gas - the plumber was due to arrive between 13.00 - 18.00 yesterday. Booked the afternoon off from work and stayed in and waited nothing, no call, no message - gave British Gas a call at 16.30 to ask if they were still coming? Was told yes, all booked and they could arrive up to 18.00No one arrived, so I rung this morning - was told that Ã¢â‚¬Å“someoneÃ¢â‚¬Â had cancelled the appointment? And that we could book an ALL DAY appointment for Saturday, I explained that was not prepared to wait in ALL DAY on Saturday as they probably wouldn't turn up again and asked for a manager to call me back this morning as my toilet is still leaking. Nothing!Absolutely shocking service - a bunch of cowboys.",British Gas

Originally broke my plumbing but came to fix it within 72 hours ,British Gas
British Gas insurance a waste of time I had what I was told by their engineer was a leaking pipe they wouldn't fix it because it was attached to a shower . Paid a plumber and the waste has come loose what's the point of having insurance when they don't diagnose properly or fix it ,British Gas
Excellent service. Emergency plumber arrived within an hour and sorted out a burst pipe with no drama.,British Gas

"We recently had an engineer call out to see to a faulty kitchen tap. After he left there was a problem discovered in the hall from the stop tap a leak over night, this covered the carpet and soaked it through. We have only had the carpet down a few months. We then had another engineer call out to rectify the problem,he apologised for what had happened after the first call out. We are now left with a smell in the hall as the water has soaked through to the floorboards. We are needing some compensation for this. I did speak to someone over the phone who asked would I like a manager to call me,I am still awaiting the call to discuss the issue.",British Gas

I had a leaking pump isolation valve and rang Homecare and Tracey eventually managed to arrange for someone to come later the same morning as it was constantly dripping. The engineer quickly fixed it by replacing the valve. A lifesaver. ,British Gas
"I have called out British Gas 3 times over the last 3 years or so.First was for a leaking pipe from my downstairs basin. When they arrived, they told me they couldn't fix the pipe until I have removed all of the tiles from wall. So, in short, they never fixed it and I had to repair the pipe myself (without removing the tiles by the way)Second time I called, I had a leak from one of the pipe in the cylinder upstairs which was leaking onto my ceiling downstairs. They came out and said they couldn't find the leak on the pipes from the cylinder and that the leak was coming from a pipe in my ceiling. They cut a hole about 200mm x200mm into my ceiling. There was no leak in the pipes in the ceiling. They then checked the pipes from the cylinder again and lo and behold, they found the leak. The hole they cut into my ceiling was unnecessary. Had they looked properly the first time, they wouldn't have had to cut a hole in my ceiling. So it cost me Â£150.00 to get ceiling repaired again.The third time I called them out, my tumble dryer had failed. The drum had stopped rotating. Considering the time of year, people are heavily reliant on their tumble driers to dry their clothes. However, I have to wait 11 days for them to come and fix it and pay a Â£60.00 excess once they eventually get to my home in the hope that they can fix it on the day. So three call outs and all three have cost me money and time.Truly, for a company the size of British Gas, this is pitiful service and poor engineering capability. I've cancelled my contract from March next year and that's the end of British Gas for me.I have many other ways I could waste my money rather than putting it into the pockets of companies that are incompetent.Steve Freeman",British Gas

Called British Gas to repair sticking water valve repaired in half an hour with new valve .,British Gas
Yesterday morning I discovered I didn't have any water or heating. I booked a repair with British Gas as I have an insurance cover for plumbing. It is impossible to getan engineer to look at the problem as it is classed as not an emergency even though I an nearly eighty and disabled. Southeast water were very helpful and arrived this morning to look at the metre and outside water. Apparently the meter is O.K so it is probably an inside issue but British Gas will not send an engineer or tell me when an engineer can look at the problem. It won't be today and they are not sure when it will be. Because I have NO WATER or NO HEAT it is not an emergency. In end I will have to call 111 and tell them I feel really ill.,British Gas
"I thought I had an under-floor leak and someone from DynoRod came and investigated.  He quickly found that the rising damp was not because of a leak, but probably a building issue in that the water could be coming from the roof, the cavity wall or the damp course or some other external source.  It was really helpful and I have just had someone here to investigate. Thank you for the knowledgeable DynoRod operator!",British Gas
"We had a leak in the bathroom so called BG and paid Â£60 and they solved it , the next morning we had another leak in a different pipe in the same bathroom and had to pay another Â£60 , we pay Â£400 a year for home care and feel this is not fair, the 1st guy knew there was a problem in the 2nd pipe but did nothing about it ",British Gas
"Had water coming up from the kitchen floor tiles, a nightmare. British Gas insurance sent out Dyno Rod. Leaking dishwasher hose found within 5 minutes. They picked up new parts and all was fixed within the hour. A great service and a huge relief. Took 3 days to dry it all out so no small leak. Thank you. ",British Gas
Our water tank in the loft leaked into the bedroom. On reporting it Dyno came out the same day. Ordered us a new water tank and it was fitted as soon as the could do it.

"Well, let's start by saying that I did find a great plumber through Checkatrade.  And he could do the work almost immediately.  At a reasonable price.The issue is that Checkatrade sent details of my job out to a number of plumbers and I did not know to whom.  Once I had sorted out who was to do the job (and the plumber I picked responded very quickly) and had the work done, there is no way of getting Checkatrade to tell the other folk they had contacted  that the job was no longer available.This wasted the time of a number of plumbers and wasted my time answering them all.",CheckATrade
"Robson heating and plumbing came to turn an existing downstairs toilet into a shower/wetroom, and to refresh the upstairs bathroom with new boards, flooring and to give me an accessible shower, a job the previous plumber was unable or unwilling to do. They understood what I wanted and offered further ideas for safety and style features. The price was very reasonable. Liam communicated and coordinated throughout, making sure I was happy with the design and accessories and that his team was progressing well. They were a happy group, very hard working,  courteous and safety conscious.Problems arising during the job, and teething problems afterwards, were swiftly dealt with. There was some damp which caused a rethink, and a few other changes/improvements and both bathrooms ended up exactly as I wanted, but looking even better than I'd imagined.I  would recommend Robsons for both quality of workmanship and products; Liam insisted on more than one occasion that he wasn't prepared to make changes that compromised his standards. We had a good working relationship; he understood what I wanted and needed and I was guided by his expertise.",CheckATrade

"Scammers supporting awful low life scammers.Hired a private roofer from checkatrade (9+ starts reviews wow). We agreed he would produce a professional full report for 190 pounds(a discount on top for locals) and he would fix a side verge cap that had been done terribly by another scammer before). He showed up, did not go on the roof, talked about how much this would be so much more, his sister does scaffolding, blah blah, valley to be redone, ridge to be redone. Funny thing, leak is on another side of the roof lol!. He left, I needed the report for insurance, chased him after paying him already, he sent 3 sentences in an email of no report, just a simple misspelled quote!! Have been dealing with checkatrade, they said file a claim, we might send surveyor, maybe you get something?!!! I have been sending them proof of scam for days, cannot be bothered.

It has taken 6 weeks to get the point where they are happy to fight my claim with the trader, but my only option is to have the trader return to finish the work. I do not want this, the trader is untrustworthy & I wish to find my own new trader to finish the job.

Not only did he promptly identify and resolve the issue with a replacement part he had on hand, but he also conducted thorough testing to confirm the repair's success. Furthermore, he generously shared valuable maintenance tips to prolong the machine's lifespan. Their swift response, expertise, and customer-centric approach have earned my highest recommendation. I'll undoubtedly be passing on their contact to friends and family",CheckATrade

A week ago the wet room pump stopped pumping out the shower water.  After days of waiting my housing association finally got a plumber out.  He took one very quick look and within a minute said the pump was fine and it was a drainage job.  He didn't even take the cover off the pump.  Today I received an expected phone call from a friendly lad called Jason from Blockbusters Portsmouth.  When he arrived took one look and said it was the pump!  He removed the cover and found a blockage within 4 mins.  Absolutely first class customer service from start to finish.  I wouldn't hesitate in recommending him.,CheckATrade
"I acquired a new property in Milton keynes in May 2021 and check a trade has been useful as I got most of my work done through their builders. Everything thing has been fantastic and I always gave good reviews until 26/12/2033 when I contracted vedro construction based in Northampton to help renovate my downstairs toilet. I provided everything from tiles, toilet, sink, tap. I was given a quote and he said he was going to finish within 3 days. On day 2 he sent me a message that I needed to pay extra Â£687 of somethings he bought and extra Â£180 for extra plumbing work he did. I wasn't convinced so I asked for receipt of the things he claimed he bought for the project which was not initially discussed in the quote. He sent me the receipt which I'll post following this review. I the for checked with another builder and I was advised most of these items were not used for my project. I was therefore not happy to pay for the extras. I gave an honest review with evidence of messages and receipts on check a trade. They initially published this and later on connive with this builder to take it down. This same builder caused a leakage in my upstairs bathroom by switching on the mains without permission. Now I have no lights in my lounge and my radiator upstairs also not working. He again insured an invoice of Â£200 for the leakage. I'm very much disappointed with check a trade. This platform is not allowing me to post receipts and the evidence. Iâ€™ll never recommend check a trade to anyone and Iâ€™ll not be using them henceforth as they are biased in their reviews to only publish good reviews of their listings to entice customers. If trust pilot would allow Iâ€™ll post the whole conversations with receipt for the whole world to analyse.i would like to post the receipt and the conversation. How can I do that please.",CheckATrade
Contacted checkatrade and they put me in touch by phone with S P Pavings (Steve Price) to sort out rainwater soakaway from overflowing hopper. S P Pavings turned out to be a total cowboy company. Block paving footpath dug for pipe installation collapsed after 2 days. Hardstand pebbled area dropped 9 inch. Pipe drain unsupported along its full 4 meter length. All this substandard work is on 6 hour cctv footage. Contacted Steve price in first week after substandard work and not prepaired to rectify.This work cost Â£770.00 and requested cash. This nullified the checkatrade guarentee and their complaints department were no help and were actually obstructive in not giving me his trading address to write a letter of complaint and take issue further. Do not use checkatrade or S. P. Pavings for any work.,CheckATrade

"I found that going through checkatrade guarantee is nothing more than a waste of time. I have done everything they have asked, I have provided them with all the information they requested and even more. What it comes down to is that they will always be on the traders side. I paid for some work to be done and was over charged. The surveyors report clearly states that the work is sub-standard and due to this my property has been damaged. The report states the cost to put the roof leak right and also that the trader well over charged. I paid Â£1,700 to have it sorted out. However the trader only has to pay me Â£1,250 with the VAT on top it takes it to Â£1,500. Checkatrade state that he doesn't pay the VAT, which has got to be the stupidest thing I've every heard. You don't buy a TV for Â£1,000 take it back & you get Â£800 back because they keep the VAT. The information that I provided that clearly shows that the trader is a fraudster, crime reference number, CCTV & audio of trader lying and make threats aren't even looked at.As the trader stated Checkatrade will pay me Â£1,000 and then in a couple of days the trader gets in touch with them and pays them the Â£1,000 and he gets to keep Â£700 for the substandard work.To top it of I should have received the surveyors report the same time as the trader. That never happened, I had to ask for it so that I can see what is said in the report and also in the email that was sent it states if I don't accept offer then they will close the case. I have not received a offer for the trader. It's good to know that the customers can be robbed for there money and checkatrade is on the traders side.",CheckATrade

"Checkatrade Guarantee is WorthlessOne of their tradespeople causing a great deal of destruction in my property. I contacted Checkatrade to make a claim using their Â£1000 guarantee which would at least fix *some* of the damage and poor work.It seemed promising at first, a long phone call where they claimed they took lots of notes and put it all on file, and told me exactly what I needed to do to be able to make a claim - Leaving a sub 5 star review, offering the bad workman to be allowed to repair the work (what a crazy thing for them to suggest, however reluctantly I said I would allow this to happen but he will be under supervision) and a few other things.Opened the claim online, provided all the documentation they request like bank statements showing payments, photos of the damage and bad workmanship (they only allow 5 which does even begin to cover it so I sent a link to a Dropbox with tens of photos and videos) a description of the issues (I also added a full PDF to the dropbox stating each and everyone as the claim form only allows a few sentences).Then it all goes dead. They barely reply, you have to keep prompting them and then you get back questions to things you have already answered previously, and after doing so, and pointing it out, they go silent again.They also have said I cannot do any remedial work until they have sent out their surveyor to assess the damage - so currently I have no working kitchen because of this and they wont give me a date for a surveyor despite asking multiple times, so this is how they treat the users of their service. It's starting to look like this Guarantee isn't worth anything at all, however I am documented the entire process and will be transferring it to Trading Standards to ensure that if this is indeed what it looks like, a 'fake'  warranty, then they will be held account for false advertising. I will update this review continually following how Checkatrade handle this moving forward.",CheckATrade

Another trace and access business came, charged a lot for very little. Neither businesses for each job were of use. I need two other trades to 1 - to create and build a gate/summerhouse, 2 - a gardener/landscaper. Wonâ€™t be putting either jobs on this site.

Emil informed that he could get me the condenser at half the listed price but would take a few days as weekend, but he did have another condenser and said that he could try it and if it didnâ€™t work he wouldnâ€™t charge me anything and would duly order the part and install later in the week. With no fridge or back up (was preparing to purchase an under counter one) I gladly accepted his suggestion. Emil came as we agreed on the Saturday and after 25 mins I had a working fridge, and a less the stress of replacing an integrated built in kitchen fridge.

"Update 19/2/24 Published my 3.5* critiqueUpdate:17/2/24 - Check a Trade - Compensation applied.--""Enthusiastic Handyman, but very disappointing, due to duplicitous:""trying it on, childish greed"" after agreeing contract that entire job would be Â£45 in total. After locating the source of the actual leak in the loft, then deviously demanding ONLY at payment time that:""Ohh..yeah...I can't just charge you that Â£45 now...since I went into the loft...it'll be Â£100 now....normally on the market, the price would be Â£150 ^^ (he forgot to mention that market professionals would actually also advise the client BEFORE rushing off to do what they'd classed as chargeable extra work).Story: Investigating a possible water leak from inside a wall.I started with having received 2 x quotes from Check-A-trader and the first called Abdul from Build My way (listed on the platform) proved to be the cheaper one (whilst the other came in close at Â£49 with Direct property Maintenance - and the 3rd didn't reply at all).Both were polite, but Adbul, arrived on the scene a few days later, for an appointment to consult, during which we verbally agreed a contract/understanding (later written down as well on WhatsApp, being very specific as I proposed the offer to him, which basically involved:a) Hiring him to investigate where the leak was and assess what needed to be done to fix it.b i) Then, if it was a minor pipe leak, that he could fix, to fix it there n then, for the agreed Â£45 inclusive.b) ii) If he couldn't fix it however, like he explained, in this scenario, to leave it open and return another day, whilst we contacted our Gas Products Care company to repair it (who would do so for free).c) Then in this case, Abdul would've returned on another day, to patch the openings up (which to his credit, he was as careful as he could be, without tearing too many of the plaster boards down as it were, whilst attempting to show me where the leak was n wasn't), all for the same Â£45.Problems begin:1) Abdul, said he suspected that the actual water leak was likely from the half cut but perhaps, improperly sealed up pipes, that led upto the loft, about 3 x meters above (after carefully and considerately opening up sections of  the front and side inner walls, plasterboards leading up to the loft (which housed from memory a small water tank), that was once part of an ""older central heating system, whereby one switches on the heating for the hot water cylinder for 30 min, before you get hot water, which was mostly. but not completely it seems,  removed nearly 7-9 years ago"").2) He then assured that he could fix it and after spending 3-4 mins looking around, shouted down from above (I was right beside him or 4-6 meters away in the adjacent room, throughout mnearly all of his 90 + mins there, during the explorations, and remained nearby to the loft entrance as he went to work up there), that he had found the source of the leak, which was, after opening off the lid of the remaining small tank (my memory was correct after all) that had been left up in the loft, when we upgraded our Gas Products around 8 + years ago), revealed to be some old water, circa 10 litres or so, that, whenever the house shook (due to passing HGVs perhaps) would cause it to leak some, into an overspill drain on it's inner side, that in turn flowed down a poorly sealed pipe (just been squeezed shut years back, no soldering).So great, I felt, it wasn't storm dmg or roof leaking! Abdul said he could easily clean it up for us - and I thought in my excitement that it was part of  the same price he had offered (else I might have opted to clean it up myself, had I realised in adv, what he would propose...).N.B. I was assisting him, like his assistant throughout, i.e. he didn't complete this job on his own, whatsoever(I helped him up the loft, then back down again when he'd finished + found him some old card then a manual water pump/extractor + finally, the best approach, that of an old water mug and a foot-soak tub and tea towel, so that he could clear the water > which took 3 x rounds, involving him passing the filled foot basin/tub down to me, to empty then return to him, back n forth, before he soaked up the remnants of the water from the loft tank, to dry it up).N.B. Today, 24hrs later, we've found some new water drops on a cardboard box, inside the prev soaked utility cupboard, which we suspect was the last of the water, he'd tried to brush into the overflow drain/old pipes.3) Deviously breaking contract:As I offered to pay him, he:*Now expected Â£100*2 mins later  (""can I be cheeky n have Â£110 ^^"")*I said only Â£105 max > him ""ok only cos u agree to offer me more work ^^"").More than x 2, the initial Â£45 agreed (I helped with at least 33% of his work myself!).*As he left, he pleaded for an old Â£100 fish tank, for his 8 yr old son, advised him: ""try Freecycle"".Reprehensible",CheckATrade

"I have come to the conclusion that Checkatrade exists to serve the traders that it seeks to represent (and who obviously pay for that privilege) rather than consumers.I sent a request for a quote, through Checkatrade, for a simple plumbing job to one highly rated business who didn't reply. So, I then let the system choose a selection of traders for the same job. It chose three potential parties including the same organisation that didn't reply previously. I did receive two responses (from the others). The first came back very quickly however it was based some distance away and quoted an hourly rate and, in addition, reserved the right to return (on a chargeable basis) if it didn't have the relevant parts - I politely declined this. The second corresponded with me by text (so deliberately not through the Checkatrade System?), agreed a price and a date for the work only to ""cancel"" as ""something has come up"" an hour or so before he was due to commence the job. I followed up, twice, to ask if he could / would reschedule without even receiving the courtesy of a response.The whole episode wasted 8 days. I have now arranged for another (non-Checkatrade) plumber - recommended by a friend - to undertake the work.Interestingly - and quite obviously deliberately (in order to avoid negative reporting) - the follow-up surveys sent by Checkatrade do not provide the chance to report any experience such as the one that I encountered...",CheckATrade

"I will continue to rate this dreadful company till the leaks in my roof are resolved. At the end of the day they allow traders to use their platform in order for the traders to generate more work.In exchange the traders pay Checkatrade for the privilege. Therefore Checkatrade are responsible for all traders that use their platform. I doubt that all traders are vetted therefore a trader who professes to be a roofer wonâ€™t be necessarily vetted.Itâ€™s a lot easier just to take their fees, after all how can you know if a roofing job has been carried out successfully? The only way you will know is if you donâ€™t get another leak and if you do then you know the job isnâ€™t finished. This can take several months to realise which is why writing a review at the outset is pointless. The roofer in question came here three times and still failed to resolve the problem. Checkatrade basically just didnâ€™t want to know and after more than six months told me to go to Citizens Advice. As for their so called guarantee THAT IS A COMPLETE JOKE. There is no such thing as a guarantee. I will continue to review this company worth no more than a one star rating till the problem with my roof is resolved. All the decorating undertaken in 2022/23 has to be done all over again therefore I expect them to PAY.",CheckATrade

All the old tiles were taken off and the walls made good for the new ones. We changed the spec after a few days to include a sink in the toilet. This didnâ€™t phase them, they laid the plumbing easily. The walls above our dado rail were plastered by fellow tradesmen and the retitling was also done by another specialised tiler. The tilers also laid a new laminate floor and changed the toilet door to open outward to make room for the new sink. They both did perfect jobs.

After speaking to Luke i felt he would do an honest and proper job. He spoke well and covered all the areas of concern with possible remedial action. He arrived on the agreed day and completed the agreed work to a high standard. The repaired roof is no longer leaking. The cost was as agreed and a very fair price. Highly recommended.,CheckATrade

So then I phoned the owner of Pure gas and we discussed it. I accepted the quote and he said he would have an engineer here by Monday morning if possible to fit the new Gas Products and flu.  on Monday morning Marcus arrived to fit new Gas Products, flu, divert, valve, and room stat, which I had requested.He worked all hard all day and by the end of the day had almost finished and I was able to have Heating back on.On Tuesday he came back to flush the system with chemicals drain and refill and commission the Gas Products.Marcus behaved, impeccably, polite Thorough and conscientiously.I truly canâ€™t fault the company.",CheckATrade

Required external pipes and guttering to be replaced and initiallysked for quotes for insurance purposes.Not one plumber responded to my request and I then again asked for quotes to repair non insuranceâ€¦yet again no response. This was despite the fact that I asked 2 plumbers directly and they didnâ€™t even bother responding.I then contacted a plumber whom Iâ€™d found previously on Checkatrade and voilaâ€¦success!

I then chose one with lots of positive feedback for a quote. He was very polite, friendly, reliable and reasonably priced. I am very happy with his service. Far better than choosing someone unknown from the internet. CheckaTrade gives me comfort in that they publish all reviews (positive and negative)  for each workman so you know who you are hiring and also give details of the job the tradesman has carried out. I was then asked to leave feedback which was published within a couple of days. ",CheckATrade

"i have had in the past okay experiences with the platform, however on this occasion i need to say no, in the market for a new kitchen to sell the flat, had quite a rude arrogant toxic response from a company called dream doors, all they had to say was they would decline the job however is was prey to quite insulting language on how i have wasted their time and not to contact them well it was let's say more rude than than that i won't go into expletives it was quite a rude rant, so i posted up a review and for some reason check trade has decided to remove my complaint feedback , this is a complete disgrace my review was honest and justified so to warn other prior people wishing to get quotes so can safely say i will not use check a trade ever again as the removal of the review is that of a dictatorship ",CheckATrade

"As I was unable to get a good recommendation for a builder, I utilised the Checkatrade website to find a builder capable of undertaking a relatively complex building job. The job was twofold. First the replacement of an old (failing) wooden lintel, that had become rotten (due to water leaking through brickwork) and causing bowing in the brickwork of an upstairs bedroom window. The second part of the job was repointing the front of the house (to stop water leaking through to the lintel and into the cavity). AME explained that, due to the nature of the work and the state of the brickwork, that simply repointing the brickwork would be insufficient, as many of the bricks would have to be taken out and replaced.The work went ahead quickly. Inevitably some minor degree of mess was created, but care was always taken by their workmen to minimise this (protective groundsheets, etc.). Both the exterior and interior work was carried out to a high standard. The old (rotten) wooden lintel being replaced by a new steel lintel, and the brickwork restored. The workmen always cleaned up after themselves, both daily and, of course, after the job was complete. AME were professional throughout, explaining everything that needed to be done and the options available. I would be more than happy to recommend them to anyone else. Thanks also to Checkatrade!",CheckATrade

"Following a telephone call to Taunton Drainage, Matt the Engineer called me back to discuss the problem. He advised me when he would be attending and turned up on time at about 6p.m. to deal with the chaotic mess caused by the blocked drainpipes problem. In Matt's own words the situation was 'Impressive'  He kept me posted throughout the whole procedure and sent me videos and photos as I was not present at the house so I could see exactly what was happening.  Matt was able to clear most of the blockages on that evening, which allowed bathrooms and kitchens to be used again, despite the rain and the dark, and will return to complete the remaining 2 pipes.  I would definitely use their services again and recommend them highly.",CheckATrade

"Moved in 3 years ago, had all electrics done and recently a new bathroom, found both tradesmen on checkertrade both top quality ",CheckATrade
"I needed a professional bathroom fitter to convert my bathroom from a shower over the bath, to a disabled walk in shower.  Checkatrade automatically sprang to mind as the place to go to hire such a person/company.Unfortunately, I could not be more wrong.  The tradesperson - Aqua Tiling in Hoddesden - did an absolutely appalling job, then intimidated me when I was alone in the house, to pay him straightaway, without even allowing me, or my husband, to look over the work.  He didn't give me the ""grand tour"" of my shower area, nor even gave me the instructions on how to use the shower.  After he had gone, it was completely clear why he wanted his money and drive away.The mixer taps aren't straight, the tiled walls aren't in alignment (they bow out and then in) he has tiled over gaps, rather than filling them in with plaster and/or plasterboard.  He tiled over an empty socket, which had a red wire in.  He badly scratched the shower tray in 2 places, and scratched a new basin tap in 2 places.  Where he has finished the tiling for new tiling to carry on for the rest of the room, the tiles stand roughly 5mm-10mm away from the wall. Honestly, it looks absolutely dreadful.My walk-in shower is also not ""walk-in"".  The shower trays stand 150mm high, which, for an able bodied person is hardly a step at all.  However, the tradesperson knew I was disabled with mobility issues, and that I needed to be able get in the shower before and after my major surgery in a few months.  He advised that the waste was not in the floor so the only option was to create a frame for the tray to sit over.  I was very disappointed, but he said it would be fine and that it would only be a few mm high.  I do not  call 150mm a few mm.  The finished result is a tray that does not sit over the frame, but sits on it, which is what has made it so high - I have had to buy a step just to get in unaided.When I alerted Checkatrade of the problem, they informed me they would try and mediate, but they are, after all, only a ""Independent Directory and Review Platform"".  Did anyone else think they were so much more?  To sum up, the tradesperson ranted down the phone at me (for 20 minutes) after I alerted him to problems with the shower area and he will not give me any money back to facilitate getting someone in to correct his poor workmanship.  He says I'm being picky.  However, my husband, and 3 other tradesman who inspected the work, have the same view as me.  In fact they used words like ""terrible"" and ""a disgrace"" and if the Tiling Association saw it they would condemn it.  Checkatrade, however, said they cannot do anything more.  If the tradesperson says they don't want to discuss it anymore, then they cannot do any more.  The whole thing came to Â£3,411.56, and every time I go into my bathroom, I want to cry because it is so awful.I will never use Checkatrade again.  What is the point, if they cannot help when things go wrong?",CheckATrade
I am always sceptical and nervous about using trades. I usually opt for doing it all myself. For me this generally works well but you have to know your limitations. I needed a roofer that knew their stuff and could stop leaks down my Gable wall. I knew the probably cause but to do this job quickly and safely needs professionals. I looked at Reviews on Google and picked a potential company. However I was not convinced reviews were genuine. I tried Check a Trade and the company had very good and importantly consistent reviews over a period of time. Using Check a Trade also gave a small value warranty but non less valuable. There was also a third party to assist if anything did go wrong. Fortunately my experience was similar to others that had gone before. I will now use Check a Trade if I need help again,CheckATrade

"I hired a painter and decorator, True Colours Belfast. The quality of the work was very poor.  I was at work when most of the paintwork was carried out and when they finished, its was then I noticed work was really bad.  Tried to contact the painter twice but ignored, so left a review on Checkatrade and they contacted me.  They told me that they would get on to the painter about this matter.   When they did reply I got back an automated email.  It was my first time using this service, never again,the fact that I couldn't get an outcome to resolve the problem was up setting.  I paid over Â£2000 to this company, so I do feel I got duped.   Will just go back to find a tradesman by word of mouth. This is what has happened since I posted a review.I have had some emails back and forth for a few weeks with check a trade.  I gave Checkatrade the evidence they needed to confirm what I had written in my review.  The only solution they gave was to let the firm back in to refix what they did the first time.  After I stopped laughing I did consider it, but I already found a decorator who was far superior to True Colours.  They had already fixed about half and after what they did to my kitchen cupboards I am considering putting  in a new kitchen.  I don't know why they contacted me if they knew they were not offering compensation.  More again from Checkatrade email number 9.  I am not getting any compensation as I am using a local person who is trying to fix the damage caused.  As I am not being invoiced for this work I cannot get any recompense.Just one important thing and the saga is over: keep every invoice, text, phone record, screen shot email before and after pictures just in case you need to claim.  One lesson I have learnt with using this firm I will be doing so with any further work I may carry out.  Avoid this service as it gives no service only to the traders.",CheckATrade

He attended same afternoon and called me to say certain parts were required and quoted me a price. He went to Plumb Centre in evening traffic, bought the part, returned, fitted the part, repaired and serviced the Gas Products. Total cost Â£340 seemed quite reasonable to me. I have since sent the plumber to another of my property. Quite happy that the repair was resolved on the same day. Great service by the heating engineer.",CheckATrade
"We had been considering a new kitchen for a couple of years. One of the most important things for us was to work with a company who understood our vision, while also offering ideas, what has worked on other jobs, showing us the art of the possible and being able to manage the entire process from design to completion. This is why we selected Brighton and Hove Kitchens. Also living locally to the shop and their vast experience with Victorian houses was a big attraction.Our initial meeting with Graham was really helpful in understanding what could be done with the space we had and to be complimentary to the Victorian property and its original features. Graham and Jem worked with us throughout, providing their experience, design suggestions and multiple iterations of the design. Nothing was ever too much trouble for them to provide us with our dream kitchen.The project was formalised and a timeline provided which was extremely helpful in setting expectations for deliveries, trades, disruption etc. as well as allowing us to manage our time around the build. The trades involved with the project were all provided by the Brighton and Hove Kitchen team and were all excellent. The teams were great time keepers, respectful, tidy and trustworthy. We provided a house key for the team so they could continue the work without disrupting or inconveniencing us. Graham and Jem were consistently transparent with us about how the work would progress which meant that some days the team (if ahead of schedule) wouldnâ€™t be on site. As is always the case in these types of projects, we discovered some unknowns, which again, credit to the team, were managed seamlessly so we got the outcome we wanted.The quality of the kitchen, appliances and work surfaces are of an extremely high standard and has provided us with a contemporary kitchen whilst also connecting subtle design features into the Victorian history of our home. The team has provided a fantastic service from start to finish and we wouldnâ€™t hesitate in recommending them. Great work guys and thanks so much!Phil & Julie",CheckATrade

"A inept and later criminal roofer worked on our house . Charged Â£4000 . Roof leaked in days . Roofer subsequently jailed for burglary of different customer , so not available to undertake repairs . Claimed the max Â£1000 comp from checkatrade . Despite water coming into the house , they never altered THEIR timescales .  Took 2 months . Claim settled in the end ( 7th March 2024 ) , but at no time did checkatrade alter their processes / timescales to support us , reflecting the urgency of the situation . Follows that had we undertaken remedial work before claim settled , not sure if we would have received our compensation. How this roofer passed the â€˜checksâ€™ to be listed by checkatrade remains unanswered .Based on our experience , I would not trust checkatrade to provide competent and honest trades people . Be aware if you do use them and have a problem , their response will be slow and exclusively on their terms . Have given 2 stars as comp was paid in the end , otherwise would have been 1.

"Used a heating engineer for Gas Products repair for 1 of my residential rental properties. The 78 year tenant has been there for 14 years, as I make sure everything is as good as possible. I take pride in being a good landlord. The Gas Products was loosing pressure. I found a new engineer on checkarade. I Paid the engineer Â£430. Later that night after the repair, the tenant messaged me saying the Gas Products had completely cut out, no lights or power. Engineer came back in the morning, took the Gas Products case of and the inside of Gas Products was drenched in water.   This new leak (after he fitted new parts to water system, Expansion vessel and PRV) had blown the clock and fuses hence no power. He said it was condensation and not his fault, absolute rubbish as he didn't do correctly which meant I had to then buy a new time clock for almost Â£100. Also any time there are power cuts in the village the Gas Products does not get drenched in water after it looses power. The Gas Products then broke down again after this water damage . He said the cause was the new replacement time clock which again was not true as the replacement was a Digital Single Channel Timer compatible to this Gas Products! Also the Gas Products was rumbling due possibly to the fan and nothing to do with loss of power or as he stated the incorrect clock. He refused to look at it and told me to calm down and not contact him again. I contacted Checkatrade and they've informed me that to go through their complaints and refunds process (I'm within the 30 days) means I can't have it repaired by anyone and I have to wait 2 weeks for their surveyor to turn up who then rights a report and then wait again for those results. This means leaving a 78 year old vulnerable tenant in a property in the hills in the middle of a Scottish winter with temperatures at freezing without hot water or heat for the next 2-3 weeks minimum which is obviously impossible! Should I also allow the pipes to freeze and flood the other neighbours? Who would be responsible for the repair should his happen? We started our NHBC registered building company 30 years ago and have also been a member of RICS so am fairly clued up in this industry. Having not been in this position before (I've always used rated-people and trustatrader without issue of quality of workmanship) it seems that this is far from practical whilst also highly dangerous to the health and well-being of an OAP who has suffered numerous heart attacks and needs heating, whilst putting all other neighbouring properties and people at potential risk of flood should pipes freeze! I believe its 2024 not 1924. ",CheckATrade

I chose him because he gave knowledgeable advice, despite the fact that as a septugenerian serial granddad I naturally Know It All.

I delayed my report by a day or two, because there was a minor bit of snagging - refix of an external fan louvre. Despite the Easter hols he responded straight away & organised a fix on the first available day. That's my idea of a good contractor. Sam is easy to talk to and practical. Highly recommended.",CheckATrade

Checked to see if my review went live - eventually it did, with another bad review of the same plumber with evidence they've done the same thing to another customer. Plumber has since changed numbers on Checkatrade which is really weird. Poor lack of communication with Checkatrade. Avoid them at all costs, and go with 'word-of-mouth' from friends, neighbours, or others you trust. They just back and support their traders, and NOT the consumer paying for services! ",CheckATrade
"I put my simple plumbing needs into Checkatrade early on a Monday morning, and within an hour I had a list of local plumbers who were willing to do the work for me.

"Title: Beware of Checkatrade: A Trader's ReviewAs a tradesperson, I signed up for Checkatrade hoping to expand my client base and grow my business. However, my experience with Checkatrade has been nothing short of disappointing and frustrating.First and foremost, Checkatrade has failed to deliver on its promises. Despite paying a significant membership fee, I have not received any leads or jobs through their platform. It feels like I'm pouring money down the drain without seeing any return on investment.What's even more infuriating is the lack of customer support and communication from Checkatrade. Despite my repeated attempts to reach out to them for assistance, nobody calls back, and my concerns remain unaddressed. It's incredibly frustrating to be left in the dark, especially when you're paying a premium for their services.One of the most egregious issues I've encountered with Checkatrade is their membership policy. They automatically renewed my membership without my consent, even after I explicitly told them that I wished to cancel. This lack of transparency and disregard for their customers' wishes is unacceptable and unethical.In my opinion, Checkatrade operates like a scam company, preying on hardworking tradespeople like myself. They take your money without providing any tangible benefits or support in return. It's a classic case of paying for a service that you never receive.Overall, I would strongly advise other tradespeople to steer clear of Checkatrade. Don't fall for their flashy marketing and empty promises. Save your money and invest it in platforms and services that actually deliver results and value for your business.",CheckATrade
"I've been using Checkatrade for a long time, and itâ€™s good when it works. I've hired everything from plumbers to electricians to handymen through this website, at different addresses over the years.There's been some good professionals who I've used more than once, and there's been others who are terrible and who clearly don't value being professional. Some who donâ€™t return calls or emails, some who say they will be donâ€™t, some who donâ€™t turn up. Thankfully there are more good, than bad. I think it often comes down to whether or not they like the sound of your job. I imagine theyâ€™d prefer to take the bigger hefty projects, but instead of saying so, you just get blanked. You often have to try a few before you find a good one, but the good ones ARE there.Also, another point to add is that I am a single woman living alone. I always make sure to check the Checkatrade reviews and the certifications and often I'll also Google to try find other reviews too - just to make sure I feel happy giving this tradesman my address and letting him into my home. Thankfully, so far still safe. Not had any problems at all in that regard.",CheckATrade

"We usually bin the junk mail straight away but we held onto the local Checkatrade leaflet, thinking ""it might come in handy one day"". We never referred to it, though, because we knew our local plumber, mechanic, electrical goods repairer etc. However, one day we needed a roofer because we had a leak but we didn't know a roofer and that was the day the leaflet came in handy. Our problem leak was sorted fast. We now keep the leaflet in a safe place as you never know when you'll need it! Our thanks to Checkatrade and our roofer. ",CheckATrade

"I was contacted by Apex Roofing & Construction (Based in Wokingham) on Checkatrade.  They replaced my roof.  They didn't do a good job and only a year later the roof started leaking water.  They ignore the warranty they gave me.  I tried calling them many times (months ago) and they always have some excuse why they can't do repairs. I called Checkatrade and they said I should contact Citizens Advice. Why do Checkatrade allow ""Apex Roofing"" to be on their website?  I paid them 12'000 GBP and this is what I got in return (nothing). I am worried that I will become homeless because I don't have 12'000 more to pay for another roof replacement. ",CheckATrade

"Case reference: 00322068Emailed on Sunday, got the automatic reply saying I'll get a response within 48 hours. It's Wednesday afternoon now. So not the worst service so far, at least there was an email address and a case reference number that got generated. But if you need more time, then update the response time and send an email saying more time is required to investigate and resolve the issue.Received a Checkatrade pamphlet in the mail. Resorted to trying to find a roofer through Checkatrade when I had a non-urgent leak. Got quotes, picked a contractor, paid a deposit. This was 10 months ago. Been given multiple excuses but now haven't heard back from contractor in 2 months. Try messaging contractor through Checkatrade and the job just gets closed. Obviously not Checkatrade's fault that the contractor hasn't started / isn't returning deposit. But I'd like to get a response regarding what Checkatrade will do about this contractor. Will the contractor be warned? This contractor in the meantime has just started a second company that is listed on Checkatrade too. Don't have much confidence in the other contractors listed on the site if this contractor's companies stays up on the site. Edit: Updating review from 3 stars to 5 stars. Very shortly after my review, I got an email from reception about my issue. And I just got an email today (a week later) with an update. Acceptable first step has been taken in an attempt to get contractor to reply. Confidence fully restored in CheckATrade!",CheckATrade

The rating system and reviews given by customers on the tradespeople they have used allow you to choose someone with confidence. The Checkatrade Website is easy to navigate, their responses are quick and they regularly keep in touch with you.

"UPDATE: In order to process a claim through their guarantee process, you have to make a review public. I let them know I wasn't comfortable with this, because when I complained to the electrician directly, he took my dissatisfaction with the work personally. I feel I should still be entitled to a refund and post a review and lo and behold, I start to receive messages about how I've ruined this guy's life and business.Checkatrade might not have known that the guy was completely unreasonable but they sure as hell could have listened to my concerns in the first place and allowed me to use the scheme without escalating the situation. Just terrible=======Trades I've used through this site have been hit and miss. I'm still waiting to hear the outcome of a complaint. I think the model needs more scrutiny. I'm not sure how much or how regularly they check the work of the trades that are signed up. They say the work is checked up to 12 times. Is that once a year? Twice a year? Every other job? Are there spot checks? Or do they pick what jobs are seen or does the trade person handpick what's looked at? I wonder because in their faq's they state that we (the customer) are best placed to judge the standard of the work.I don't believe that to be entirely true. I'm not an electrician or plumber, so unless something is obviously wrong, i.e., leaking, not working, or a mess, and I can point to the problem, I won't be able to tell if it was done correctly and of safely. The electrician who bodged my job left a mess of wires that, had he'd been able to hide more effectively, I wouldnâ€™t have had any idea until it inevitably went wrong. I had to get a new electrician in to fix it and he didn't believe an electrician had installed it. The first guy I used had 10/10 reviews on Checkatrade, and he wasn't cheap. If on other jobs his work is behind walls and under floors, what's he getting away with? The issues he caused meant other work I needed was delayed by a month, leaving me unable to use my living room. There's obviously a problem here, which was reported on recently: theguardian. com/money/article/2024/may/28/does-checkatrades-vetting-really-check-out As I mentioned, they have been slow to deal with my complaint; they haven't contacted me to update me any progress. I understand they have procedures, but it feels like they don't want to take any responsibility. I've had to chase up every interaction. When I suggested I'd chosen him on their recommendation, I was told, ""No, you've gone on other customer recommendations"" which is true technically but they also say they have a rigorous checking procedure and they promise to guarantee the work.  I trusted that that process had happened. I'm not sure it could have been with this particular electrician.When something goes wrong, they should be doing their best to support you, not distance themselves and cover their backs but that's how it felt. ",CheckATrade
"A Plumber on Checktrade never a gave a quote broken down into labour  and materials so unable to compare with other quotes. I asked twice, no reply. When I tried to leave a review for the plumber the website would not let you do so unless you said if you would recommend the tradesperson ""yes or no"", no ""not sure"" or ""dont know"" option, so unable to leave a review.

"Two experiences with Checkatrade. One with roofing in St Albans with roofing & guttering that was excellent. The second was a drain clearance & survey of my mother-in-laws property in Teignmouth. The contractor was told to power wash the drain, then video survey. They did a video survey without powerwash & tried to â€œhold us to ransomâ€ for works that werenâ€™t required as they knew the property was being sold. We threatened the contractor with the small claims court for not following the scope of works, and they returned to complete the works as specified. We provided a poor review to Checkatrade who didnâ€™t want to know. Checkatrades not a bad starting place but do your own due-diligence.",CheckATrade

"I understand this is quite a long review but would recommend people read it before using Checkatrade. We have had a terrible experience with Checkatrade, both with the trader and with Checkatrade customer service. We had Juniper Plumbing come out to replace the flush valve in our toilet. After the first use of the toilet our entire flat was badly flooded. This was due to them dislodging the waste pipe within our wall cavity while replacing the valve. The valve they had replaced also got stuck open meaning water just flowed into the cavity then eventually into our flat and communal hall. When the plumber revisited, they told us they didnâ€™t know how to fix the issue and left us with a non-working toilet and our water switched off. We then had to pay a new plumber from another company to come and fix the problem. Despite Juniper Plumbing admitting to us via WhatsApp messages that they were responsible for dislodging the waste pipe and installing the faulty valve, they refused to let us go through their insurance for any repair work or compensation. We contacted Checkatrade and we were advised by them to raise a claim using their guarantee. We did this on their advice, and what followed was weeks of us having to chase them numerous times for a response and them asking us repeatedly to resend images/documents that we had already provided them. We eventually phoned them again after not getting a response to an email, and the customer service advisor tried to advise that we werenâ€™t covered as the tradesperson never invoiced us for the job they didnâ€™t complete. They eventually agreed that didnâ€™t make sense as tradesperson didnâ€™t invoice us for the initial work because they hadnâ€™t completed it, but they then tried to say we couldnâ€™t be compensated for the work because we had got it fixed before putting in a complaint. After we pointed out that would mean us having the water turned off at the mains for more than a week as you must wait 7 days after putting in a review before contacting about a claim, they then switched the reason again. Eventually they came back after â€œtalking to a managerâ€ and confirmed that we werenâ€™t covered because the damage caused wasnâ€™t directly in the area the tradesperson worked in. We again tried to explain how with water damage that doesnâ€™t really make sense and that there was damage done to the immediate area of work, but they then advised this was the final decision.So, in summary, we are left out of pocket for the repair due to the traderâ€™s damage to the toilet and extensive flood damage throughout our flat. Our experience of the Checkatrade guarantee and customer experience is that they will avoid honouring the guarantee even if it is a clear-cut case like ours. The guarantee is just a marketing tool and Checkatrade customer service is setup to ensure that claims arenâ€™t paid out.",CheckATrade
"The service was good, did job required at the time did a complete diagnostic check and took photos of the Gas Products pressure valve and the pipes on the outside wall of the building connected to our flat.he said we needed a new valve for the Gas Products, which had to be ordered.still waiting to hear if the part has arrived yet ",CheckATrade
I got in touch with checkatrade because I had a leaky roof. I had a quick response from them and several roofers got in touch. I had several quotes and finally decided to go with the one that was best for me. The roofing company I went with was brilliant and I could not be happier. I would recommend you get several quotes before you decide though as the prices may vary quite a bit from one company to the next.,CheckATrade
"This is a difficult one ....I used Checkatrafe to find a plumber.I was absolutely delighted with the service provided by the plumber (247 TradesGroup) but the whole experience was spoiled over the next few days by Checkatrades persistent demands for a review. By all means ask for one.  Maybe ask twice.  But if you don't get a response by then, just accept that the person doesn't want to bother writing a review - and if you continue to pester, you will get a bad one!So... Excellent men to do the job, excellent plumbing company - but their publicity organisation might need to think about customer relations!",CheckATrade

"I have had countless tradesmen here over the years poorly executing some seriously questionable work. So much so I have decided to move house, The worksmanship is unbearable to look at. However having discovered this check a trade app I posted a job for the kitchen ceiling to be plastered. A couple of people came along with ridiculously high quotes and one said it would be just 2  hours work. The 3rd guy came (rob morton) and had a look, explained everything, how he was going to do it, how he would solve some of the problems, how long it would take and how he would not leave it until he was completely happy.Which is exactly what he did Omg it's so smooth! I'm truly impressed with the level of detail and crafmanship that I've told absolute everyone I've come across including strangers. The ceiling wasn't level, was artexed, had coving, holes, spotlights, patches where the old skim had fallen off and was just dreadful I thought it would need boarding. Now It's perfectly smooth, including around the spotlights, the lines round the coving are perfectly defined and true, it's just craft at it's very best. It was half the price of the first quote. The room was cleaned to a really good standard when he had finished too. 6 starsIt's like a frog on wet grass - TOO SMOOTH TO MOVE!!!!!",CheckATrade
We had a small stain in our celing so I called the anglo polish builders and Slawek for repairing our roof and the job was very well done. They supplied and fitted the mashroom head to the soil pipe. Checked the flashing around the pipe and resealed all. Very quick (one day) and efficient and they knows exactly what to do. Very impressive. Very polite. Also they gave us lots of useful informations too. I will definitely recall the Anglo Polish builders if i need something else. Alf,CheckATrade

The job has been reviewed by 3 separate roofers who couldnâ€™t believe how poorly the job was done.

I received some emails and some texts (I probably could have requested one or the other however, so my fault there), I think one email may have been in junk and I had read it but couldn't find it later on...again my problem.

My complaints were passed from person to person at checkatrade and it was made clear that no remedy nor recompense would occur in the near future meanwhile water was flowing from the tap so the kitchen had to cut off from the water supply.

When I queried why hadn't a new doorframe been fitted I was told that he didn't know I asked for one although he was standing right next to me with pen and paper in his hand at the time.  They also fitted a bathroom door lock to the bedroom instead of the key lock I asked for. Before the fitters left I tried the  doors on both the bedroom and the bathroom found they were so stiff I could not open or close them.  When I informed the firm about this by text I was told that they conformed to British standards. I said that the locks were not fit for purpose and I needed locks that I could open and close.  They argued backwards and forwards by text until I said that I would not release the money until new locks were fitted. After that they did come and fit locks that were suitable.I can't fault the fitters as they did what they were asked to do by their boss but I suggest to any new customers that when they come to see what you want done that you double check what he has written down.  All in all it wasn't a pleasant thing to go through, you shouldn't have to argue with them to get the job done.",CheckATrade

"I am relating my experience for people to judge for themselves. I have used CheckATrade several times and found it hit and miss in terms of the quality of the tradespeople whatever the published reviews say.I recently requested a plumber for a leaking pipe. Only one responded and despite his entry stating free estimates, he wanted 70 pounds. Since it was a leak, I agreed. He came, did very little and asked me to pay the 70 pounds into what turned out to be his personal bank account. He then became difficult to get hold of and clearly didn't want to do the job, eventually quoting me a high price and not offering a date he would do it.I left a review on CheckATrade saying this and quickly got an offer from CheckATrade that the plumber would refund my money if I took down the review (I have their email stating this). I refused, but the review together with my initial request disappeared. After I complained, the review was put back, but edited to remove mention of the account being the plumber's personal account and the quote he offered. I have asked about this but at this point I have lost faith.The whole point about CheckATrade is that you should be able to trust reviews.I had a second reply from CheckATrade which ignored my point about editing my review (and there was nothing personally identifiable in it) so I have now drawn a conclusion about them and downgraded their review to 1 star.",CheckATrade
"The reviews were brilliant, also direct access to plumbers.",CheckATrade

I read the ratings and reviews on your site. Three companies were chosen. All companies got back to me within a couple of hours. All companies were professional and offered me good quotes for the refurbishment and supply of new bathroom. I finally picked one company who did everything they said they would and within the time scale quoted. I was totally delighted with the finished bathroom and the company who did the work.,CheckATrade
"I found the process of posting a job and waiting for interested professionals to contact me to be very easy. I was happy that I got quick responses. I could then make a confident choice to hire one who quoted and assured me of the results. I wanted external pipework re-routed to look more pleasing and to be moved more safely away from floor level to avoid getting kicked, knocked, or damaged. He did a great job, my outside area looks lovely now and I have added peace of mind that it won't get damaged",CheckATrade
"Leo did an excellent job! He is very professional, polite and reliable. Leo explained everything to me, listened to what i wanted and nothing was too much trouble for him.

I contacted checkatrade as I was looking for a plumber who would also undertake to do a little renovation work on my bathroom. Someone local got back to me within a few days and I have been very happy with the result. The tradesman in question was reliable and knowledgeable and communication was excellent throughout. I have found checkatrade to be an extremely helpful service as I live in a town where it is very difficult to find reliable people who keep you informed and also complete a job to a high standard. ,CheckATrade
Check a trade put us in touch with several possible providers and we found a plumber who we will now always use if possible.,CheckATrade
My phone call was answered promptly a very nice plumber soon turned up and mended my running outside tap ,CheckATrade
" I went to Checkatrade to find a tradesperson to replace the soak away for my septic tank. Website was easy to navigate and  it was simple to enter my  details and requirements. Their response was prompt, with the names of three traders interested given me within hours together with their contact details. I was able to speak with all traders and after discussions one quoted for job. Checkatrade  then sent me another three names and one more of them quoted. The company who gave the better quote was able to  do the work in in a fortnight's time. All went well and the job was completed on time and to my satisfaction. I would certainly use Checkatrade again when looking for a specialist trades person.",CheckATrade
I used Checkatrade to both find a bathroom installer and check others that had been recommended. The website and available information is great and we found an installer that did a great job at a good price. We've already recognised and rated him on Checkatrade.

"I booked a company calling itself Richard & Simon to revamp my bathroom after applying to Checkatrade. There reviews were 10:10 but I later learned from them that they have only been in business for few months. I felt completely ripped off and became ill fromthe stress, a complete nightmare. Rip of traders. They gave me a price by WhatsApp for their labour Â£4000 and materials Â£1000 including Â£300 disposal of waste. They did not state what materials they included. Later I learned they excluding tiles, adhesive, and bathroom furniture. The bathroom furniture I expected to be excluded but tiles they had already offered me choices with similar price range. They started ripping out the bathroom furniture then demanded Â£2000 to be paid immediately. This seemed reasonable so I paid however they provided no receipt or invoices or written quotation other than a WhatsApp message with their estimate for labour and materials without specifying the materials they were referring to. After ripping out most of the bathroom furniture they demanded the next day a further Â£2000 so I accepted to pay Â£1400 and rest on completion which was verbally accepted. They then priced in the bathroom furniture themselves with no breakdown of costs.After ripping off the old tiles and buying some of the furniture and some tiles they called me the next day demanding a further Â£3000 and remainder on completion or they would be packing up and leaving. I was away for the day with my children and had no way of arranging payment also I was becoming concerned they failed to honour our agreement that rest of payment would be on completion. On my return from day away with my children I discovered they had indeed left, taken the bathroom furniture they apparently had purchased and taken the tiles and there tools. They had laid floor tiles that after 1 day I found would crack when stepping on them and some could be lifted off the floor with your hand. Also the tile box indicated these were wall tiles not floor tiles. They then contacted me by WhatsApp to let me know if I did not pay Â£3000 more that they would not come back. I offered to pay on a daily basis to avoid being scammed although I began to realise I had been scammed by these builders. I asked for receipts for the bathroom furniture and tiles which they had taken with them. They refused and said they would have to request the receipts from the store.They ignored my offer and sent me another WhatsApp message saying they now wanted the full amount of the rest of the money to complete the project and if I did not transfer Â£4100 to them on Sunday that day by 8pm they would not be coming back. Having already paid them Â£3400.00 with tiles poorly laid on the floor that were not even floor tiles it would be very foolish of me to pay them the rest of the money when only about 30% of the work was completed and they had taken rest of tiles and bathroom furniture. They left my bathroom ripped out and poorly laid floor tiles that must now be redone for Â£3400.00I now have found a local professional reputable bathroom fitter who can rectify the faults and complete the bathroom. This was a nightmare for me and all on faith of trusting the Checkatrade reviews for these builders calling themselves Richard & Simon. I now think the reviews might have been manufactured by them. They provide no Company full address or email or website. I have learned an expensive lesson. People be warned. ",CheckATrade
Posted my problem and the day after was contacted by a plumber. SIMPLUMB. Turned out excellent. ,CheckATrade

Who ever set up Checkatrade deserves a medal. My experience today was outstanding. I really do not know how we ever got along without a service of this kind.

By going by checkatrades recommendation I was able to find a plumber that I knew I could trust to carry out the work properly.,CheckATrade
"Theres something not right with the way this company works. Ive been a member since March on the standard tier for Plumbing & Heating. This is 2 separate categories coming in at a price of around Â£275 a month. Since I've been a member, I've not had enough work to justify the subscription. I understand that there are only so many people out there that needs work doing and not all of them use Checkatrade. The jobs that are sent via the app are too far away 95% of the time. They are usually a 1-2 hour drive away, driving that far there and back for a dripping tap or leaky shower head just isn't worth it. Ive contacted Checkatrade on several occasions about this and there answer is the dynamic range will adjust overtime. Well it hasnt. This week we had several leads that were in Barrow (we're in Fleetwood) and every time we decline the job and say it too far. This does nothing. Something else weve noticed is that when a job comes through, we will contact the customer within minutes of it being posted, only to be told that they have made arrangements with someone else? How can this happen if we contact them straight away, sometimes within a miniute after it coming through, so we've started asking the customer when did they post the job. 3 customers today said that they posted the job yesterday? So why are we getting leads 24hrs later? My suspicion is that Checkatrade or their parent company are harvesting all the good leads and then dishing out the scraps to their subscribers, even what seem to be good leads are actually dead because theyve already made arrangements. Checkatrade seems to be holding up their end of the bargain by providing a minimum amounts of leads, but nothing comes of them. This is literally 95%, if not more of pointless leads. Then the app constantly pings to tell you we have customers waiting, constant emails, but theres nothing there. We are actually stuck in a contract with them until March and cant get out unless we pay Â£1500. We also havnt received our Amazon gift vouchers because we didnt have an active direct debit within the minimum 90 days which is rubbish, we were told by a member of their ""support team"" to wait till a certain date before we leave, then we would receive our voucher??? We did this, but apparently we can't leave and now that messed up our voucher. This company is a complete joke and if you are reading this, trying to make up your mind wether to join, please dont.

The plumber I found through Check a Trade responded very quickly to my enquiry & did a brilliant job at a reasonable price.,CheckATrade

We were given a prompt response with the plumber arriving in less than an hour even though it was 4pm on a Sunday afternoon our leaking toilet waste pipe was fixed within 30 minutes excellent service ,CheckATrade
"As soon as I posted the job I had interest from half a dozen companies.  Mind you, they weren't all local.  To fix two missing/broken roof slates I had interest from a company 55 miles away and another 16 miles away, so don't assume your contacts will be local.  However, the system worked well and it was easy through the Checkatrade website to chat to the interested parties and arrange a visit.  One roofer came for a quote and offered to do the job there and then.  That was perfect for me.  No more leaks.  If I have one gripe it's about the Checkatrade website.  Once the work is done there is no easy way to close the job so you get no more interest.  You have to cancel each response you've had individually.  That was clumsy.",CheckATrade
"Refurbishment Specialist (Company) - At first, Oleg had to very carefully remove the existing under-mounted bowl by cutting the silestone (quartz) worktop. He then had to cut-to-size the worktop again to fit the larger bowl. This was very difficult as this was done in-situ with a high risk of a hairline crack in the worktop while cutting. Oleg completed this extremely challenging task to perfection in just one day. He also took care of the plumbing requirements and the new sink was ready to use the next day. The kitchen was tidied up and all the trash removed by Oleg before leaving. Highly recommend, Oleg is truly a specialist!   ",CheckATrade

",CheckATrade
I have been on checkatrade for  12 years they are not the same people now. They have changed their way of charging they make you pay for each postcode you go in and leads . I was in drainage category and to get leads I was told by a sales representative to pay at least Â£2000 a month to compete with the big boys. This was way out of my budget but he convinced me to take it on. I didnâ€™t get any calls for work only calls for people ringing round for on the phone quotes and advise from customers on problems no call out work I spent around Â£3500 in six weeks and made around Â£500 this did not even cover my experience. Checkatrade is a total ripoff they just want your money and do not provide the work they promise. I have since joined other companies for less money and getting work my builder yell there are loads of other companies out there getting leads for far less money check trade are on the way out give them a wide birth Any chance of a refund then because I know you have done this to other companies in the same trades and paid back someone I know around Â£2000 for two weeks he was on your site therefore opening the door for all others to be refunded ,CheckATrade
We required a plumber and had no references or recommendations regarding workmanship.  Used Checkatrade to research and identify a good reliable plumber local to us.

Recently instructed a Carpenter/builder to fit a kitchen who had little competency and butchered my kitchen . Also installed dangerous electrics . Complained to Checkatrade who just want to discuss it with the tradesperson. No mention of their guarantee scheme and they refer you to under funded citizens advice. If a trade is on Checkatrade take it from me, itâ€™s because they are not competent to grow their business organically from satisfied customers and word of mouth. ",CheckATrade

"A friend of mind has had an awful experience using checkatrade. Having seen the evidence first hand, and having other tradesman willing to confirm the appalling work checkstrade are not doing anything saying nothing they can do. Part of the list of issues. New kitchen units poorly fitted and badly damaged Wicks canâ€™t believe workmanship.Gas left unsafe and not qualified to do work. Tiling appalling had to be removed and replaced. Despite Lady having photographs of before and after checkatrade showing little if any concern.In process of contacting BBC watchdog who initially seem interested. ",CheckATrade
so went on here looked for a plumber put my job up got a call they said we can do it today for Â£120 and take payment over the phone so because it was an emergency i said yes but unfortunately what i didnt know was that the Â£120 was a deposit and they passed the job onto a third party which then he said he can do it that day but doesnt know when but he doesnt get payed from them but would charge me Â£100 to do the job talk about a CON if they told me it was a deposit then i would have said NO and dont trust checkatrade all the time they are not trustable,CheckATrade
"Checkatrade is funded by traders. That's all you really need to know. The trader could be really good or a complete cowboy, its all income for checkatrade. As a customer if you post a negative review, checkatrade will look for any reason to remove it to protect the paying trader who provides their revenue. Hence it can't logically be trusted.The response from Checkatrade proves my point. They don't factually check positive reviews and remove them, and they just sided with the trader's account and removed my review, and continue to insist that my review was inaccurate despite admitting that they've received further photographic evidence from me. My complaint was in regard to the tradesman trying to scam me for extra material they hadn't bought & labour time supposedly spent buying it (no receipt provided) and not doing the work I asked them to carry out, which checkatrade say I have to definitively prove which would require me employing another plumber. The plumber didn't disprove my comments, they simply said that I'd only paid for labour and they were entitled to charge for materials (apparently without consulting me either before or during the visit and at a massively inflated price, which wouldn't be allowed in a court of law). Only a receipt from them showing that they'd actually bought central heating inhibitor from Plumbase at a cost of Â£25 during the site visit would disprove my comments. Let's face it if you look at checkatrade, pretty much every trader is 9/10 or above. Does that seem likely? Of course not. It only occurs because they remove negative reviews from the scoring to protect their own income stream from the paying trader. How many other negative reviews about my plumber have been 'fact checked' and removed? Could be 100s, only Checkatrade know. Why would I just make up a complaint about the plumber who claim I owe them more money only after I complained about their work? The plumber laughingly claims it's to avoid having to pay Â£30 extra for a new radiator installation that I already paid Â£224 for. Checkatrade are worse than the rogue traders as they purport to help customers avoid them.",CheckATrade

"Three years ago I used the Checkatrade register to enlist the services of a roofer. The roofer replaced an extension roof, and incorporated two Velux windows. In April of this year after contending with intermittent leaks, which the roofer, (when he could be contacted!) put down to the activities of wood mice. Reaching somewhat of an impasse, with damaged interior decorations and ceiling, I asked two independent roofers and a pest controller to inspect the roof. All agreed mice would not have caused any damage whatsoever. The two roofers were simply ""appalled"" at the standard of workmanship, saying there was nothing up to standard with the roof - the Velux windows were incorrectly fitted, the guttering and fascia's were very badly fitted, lead flashing had been omitted and that the only real option was to replace it. This cost over Â£7000. The original roofer did offer to replace the roof, but judging by the standard of his previous workmanship, the question was raised whether he even had the skills necessary (despite claiming to be a roofing specialist!) and serious doubts were also raised whether he would even complete the task at all. The only point of contact was a mobile phone number and a part of a small shared yard. I refused the offer and all requests for compensation from him were rejected. Judging by the standard of workmanship, I do not think it unfair to say that this was a rogue roofer of the first order. I wrote to the Checkatrade CEO, have exhausted their complaints procedure, them saying essentially that there was nothing they could do. I asked for an explanation as to how this rogue roofer passed all 12 of their checks (which seem to have clearly failed!) and why such an incompetent individual was foisted onto unsuspecting members of the public who trusted their registered traders. Perhaps not unsurprisingly, no reply was forthcoming. Judging by other review sites regarding Checkatrade, I am far from alone in my experience and I would urge extreme caution in using the Checkatrade register - as my trusting Checkatrade has cost me over Â£7000. Thank you for your prompt response, which is more than I got from your CEO. Indeed the work was done three years ago, but the true enormity of the appalling workmanship was not revealed until April 2024, when I got two genuine roofing specialists to assess the intermittent ingress of water and the resulting damage to ceilings and dÃ©cor. I have no knowledge of roofing, which is why I relied on Checkatrade to provide the names of reliable roofers in the first place. The poor workmanship was not a result of â€œmistakes,â€ but was either total incompetence or a deliberate attempt to rip me off on the part of the Checkatrade recommended and endorsed trader. Your â€œrigorousâ€ 12 point check list, in this case, blatantly failed to screen out this particular rogue trader and after reading other reviews on-line, this would appear to be far from an isolated incident. This would strongly suggest that the â€œrigorousâ€ checks you undertake simply do not work and a significant number of â€˜approved tradersâ€™ have conducted themselves in exactly the same manner as the one in question here. To believe that the checking process works satisfactorily is really a little delusional. (Read some of the other reviews!!!)Your email of the 1st August essentially stated there was nothing you could/would do, which is the essence of your response to my very honest, but negative review of your trader register. The apparent failure of your system is costing a number of unsuspecting and trusting members of the public very dearly.",CheckATrade
"Second time using Chalmers and Sons and will definitely continue to do so. Owen and Ben were super stars, telephone with time of arrival, really cheerful professionals. They worked in a timely manner. They explained what they had done with the shower and then went ensured pressure was ok. Tony should be applauded  for his skills as a trainer and mentor for Owen who was a trainee. He was so encouraging and supportive in explaining and validating what Owen needed to do in replacing a new shower. So refreshing to see exceptional workmanship being passed from one generation to another in a practical way.  Tony was clearly a very knowledgeable plumber and i felt very comfortable with both of them in my home.If you are looking for experienced and knowledgeable professionals  call Chalmers and sons",CheckATrade
The work was completed at the time and withing the time alloted enabling my dad to leave on time to get to his appointment. The work was completed with no mess. The plumber also visited within 24 hours to check on the work done. An excellent service,CheckATrade
We recently had our kitchen tiled by Jamie Drummond of Tile Solutions Ltd.  He was thoroughly professional and very efficient.  The job was done in two days and we hardly knew he was there.  He was very approachable and gave us some ideas when we asked him questions about the tiling.  I would have no hesitation in recommending him.,CheckATrade
"My experience with finding a , trusted tradesman on Checkatrade , was straight forward. I wanted someone to refitted a new bathroom, and knocked into one . Which I got a few tradesmen responding very quickly to me . The best part of it is you can trust these tradesmen to do an excellent job , and not be scammed like some sites . Because they are properly registered and regulated under the BSA . I personally think Trackatrade is a good place to go if youâ€™re looking for an honest tradesperson. My only complaint would be, that they should update their website , so  the customers can see the written quotes agreement made between them and the tradesmen . It seems to disappear of the chats page between you and the tradesmen. But for some reason the tradesmen can access it. ",CheckATrade

"The work was excellent but I can't give 5 stars as I think it feels very uncomfortable if you are a single lady like myself.  2 guys came to my house instead of splitting the job, one guy did all the work (bathroom and kitchen) the other guy sat on my chair and asked me: who do you live with? How old are you? What's your job? He also wanted to know when I moved in and my working schedule. He did not mention he would have brought a colleague to work with him. He said ""I've seen you like hiking from your whatsapp picture can we go hiking together, have you ever thought about having kids (which felt very creepy ðŸ˜³), why are you single"" they could have done it so much quicker if he worked instead of chatting. He also wanted to know how much I paid for my house. If I drive a car. I felt vulnerable. I still have to do flooring in the rest of my house but I will have to select only married men. When I went to bed I had anxiety thinking he might stalk me or wait for me in the car park when I'm back from work. He was also saying that British women are racist (I am not British) but as a woman I can say we are not racist he comes across as creepy and makes women uncomfortable.  I blocked him on my phone as soon as he finished his job.  ",CheckATrade

"Quite recently, I did some DIY plumbing work in our airing cupboard and, unhappily, this didn't work out as anticipated and we were left without any hot water supply. So, there was a degree of urgency!I contacted two local plumbers and left messages on their respective answerphones.   In spite of reminders, neither of them replied.I then thought of CheckaTrade and contacted them. CheckaTrade immediately sent my requirements to several plumbers and I was contacted by one of them within the hour and by another an hour or two later. I immediately followed up the first contact - Premium Heating, Plumbing and Cooling, 17 Stoneleigh Close, Coventry - who were able to give me an early start work date and a absolutely transparent charging structure. I was totally impressed and instructed them immediately. When the plumbers came, they were such pleasant, friendly and considerate young men and they did a very proficient job.I am so impressed by the help CheckaTrade gave me. Thank you.  ",CheckATrade

They investigated in the loft and found the problem, they took photos to show me which I really appreciated.They got on with the job straight away and I know longer have a leaking roof. They are very professional young men, and the cost is always very reasonable and they leave the area clean and tidy as they found it. This is the 2nd time I have used Adapt Roofers and will be using them again in the spring to replace some cladding on the front of the house. I would highly recommend as I have been so stressed, and you worry if your getting the right people in to do the job. I needn't of worried. Thanks again Adapt Roof Construction.",CheckATrade

"I had a really awful experience with CheckATrade last year, and their automated emails keep asking me to leave a rating so I thought I should share.I hired a roofer to replace my front roof, as it was a bit leaky and the membrane underneath was getting ropey. Very standard job. I found a roofer via CheckATrade and they had legit-looking reviews.Fast forward and water is pouring through my ceiling, damaging the interior and exterior of my home. The new roof looks like it was built by a clown and bits fly off it in a mild breeze. After almost a year of trying to get the roofer to resolve things, I end up hiring a different roofer and taking the old one to court to recover the costs (also: I won the court case). I tried using the CheckATrade Guarantee scheme (claim id: 1077785) to recover some of the costs of the work as it was so awful, but CheckATrade weaseled out of it by saying I had not given the roofer enough time to resolve the issue despite giving them months of fully documented time to rectify the situation. So evidently CheckATrade's guarantee is a marketing gimmick and nothing you can rely on. They're definitely not on your side.So yeah, I don't use CheckATrade to find people anymore. But I will leave a review for someone local that I hire if they ask me to.",CheckATrade

"I needed a roofer to investigate a leak and chose a company, which was listed on checkatrade, but contacted them directly based on a leaflet through the door.  They came, quoted and did the work.  Six months later the problem reappeared and I repeatedly tried to contact them to address the work which they had guaranteed.  After having been ghosted by them for two months, I decided to try again and posted a job on checkatrade.  Two companies came round to quote and I selected one to do the work.  Six months later the same happened, leak is back and I am being ghosted again.  This makes me wonder how well these trades are being vetted by checkatrade and whether there is a code of conduct for them if work isn't up to standard.  Between two experiences of unsatisfactory work and inability to contact the trades, I will not use them again or recommend them",CheckATrade
The plumber who came didnâ€™t find the leak - he just tightened a joint in a pipe and I was charged Â£174 and I still had a leak. I had to get an independent plumber who took some time and stopped the water leak which the first plumber should have found.,CheckATrade

"Went on Checkatrade to look for someone to sort out all the snags on my kitchen that the Builder left for 3 months.  Checkatrade contacted appropriate companies to match me up with a Contractor.  Adam expressed an interest and we rang him the next day to explain the situation.  He came out the following day, discuss the work that is required, which was to make right the wrongs that the builder did to my brand new Howden kitchen.  It was clear Adam was very knowledgeable and experience in fitting kitchens.  Adam worked hard to sort out the snags and made good of the snags.  Some snags were modified to make it look good, but as the Builder botched some units, it was a challenge to keep the costs down and make the kitchen look good.  I am so grateful to Adam as not many people would take on other people's work.  As Adam is multi-skilled, I am so grateful that he agreed to sort out external snags, shower room snags and complete an upstair bathroom for which the Builder took the bath out in May leaving me with no washing facilities.  Thank you Checkatrade for finding me a great guy who has and will make it possible for me to return home after 7 months of delays.  ",CheckATrade

"In general, theyâ€™re OK. I found a good emergency plumber and a great carpenter through them. The tradespeople were qualified, conscientious and fairly priced. Itâ€™s the way the app works that I donâ€™t like and it doesnâ€™t seem to be too good for domestic use. I have posted some jobs re door hanging and carpentry that have elicited no responses at all. They invite tradespeople for you, most of whom donâ€™t seem interested or are for bigger jobs. They usually misunderstand the area Iâ€™m in from my postcode and there seems no way to change this. It also seems difficult to delete the job. I have had to give up on occasions and go with MyBuilder and this hasnâ€™t been easy.",CheckATrade

Several experiences scam dishonest traders. No professional qualifications evidence provided paperwork fraudulent not adhered to quotes pressurized to keep paying more. Even a boasted 16 years on checkatrade roofer tried saying my whole roof needed replacement without even going up to inspect it.

I left a review almost 3 weeks ago and have heard nothing.

Checkatrade seem to think it is acceptable to leave a disabled person with no access to a toilet or washing facilities and have absolutely no control over their tradesmen.They allow their vetted trades to behave like this and remain listed with them. Make no mistake, checkatrade CANNOT be trusted and the guarantee they offer is not worth the paper it is written on. ",CheckATrade
"I was due to have a plumber fix my shower this morning in my holiday home which I rent out. I travelled 15 mile ( 30 mile return journey) to make sure I was there to meet him as he was due from 9am onwards. I had a phone call at 8.45am to say that he couldn't make it. Not only did I have a wasted day, but also lost income due to having to close my holiday home due to having the work done. I am totally disappointed with their service, @ Â£92 + vat for 30 minutes work, I booked them thinking I could rely on them. Obviously not. ",CheckATrade

The plumber and his mate worked for a couple of hours on our leaking toilet cistern before admitting defeat. Said they couldnâ€™t fix it. So we paid the Â£120 - but are left with a leaking toilet cistern so canâ€™t give more than one star although Iâ€™m sure the plumbers did their best. ,CheckATrade

"Checkatrade - sounds a great idea.  Find a local contractor able to do a quick professional job with guaranteed satisfaction.  Or so I thought.I needed someone local to returf my front lawn after it was destroyed by a mains water pipe replacement.  Searching Checkatrade website I arrived at a list of hopefuls only to find most hiding behind mobile phone numbers, with no way of telling where they were based.  I managed to extract about 20 names with landline phone numbers or local addresses from this list.  Just as well I did this since, after examining these numbers, found many were based miles away from my location.  One business was over 200 miles away.I selected six apparently local firms and sent identical messages to all.  One replied almost immediately.  A second did so a week later.  I heard nothing from the others, that is, until several weeks later when one firm sent a ""no can do"" message.The person who did respond sounded ideal and after surveying the job gave me a reasonable quote which I accepted, being assured he could do the job early in September.  It is now mid November and despite several messages and excuses, there seems hardly any hope of him ever doing the job.  What a waste of time and effort.  I will probably tackle the job myself next year and give Checkatrade a miss in the future.",CheckATrade
We had all our gutters cleaned out by Terry and his assistant.It was an excellent service and removed all of the accumulated dirt that had the potential to clog up the down pipe in the winter months. ,CheckATrade

When I try and follow the checkatrade process to leave a review and complain, I do not receive the text message to verify the review and it goes nowhere.

"This is an ongoing saga for the past 3 months regarding OJPlumbing Cambridge.  Yesterday the plumbers came again and took out the back of the sink unit cupboard due to the constant leaking they found the pipes totally inadequate for the job and I have taken photos of the rotten wood,  The cupboard is going to need to be totally ripped out and new one installed at another cost to us, thankfully for us it is a bungalow with concrete floors so all the damage done by OJ plumbing can be contained I dread to think what would be going on in a house with wooden floors.We are trying to pursue all this with Checkatrade.com but so far we have only had one reply telling us to check their terms and conditions, which we have and believe we have a case to consider.Please read my last post on the other work that has already had to be redone before employing OJ plumbing as weâ€™d hate another family going through this trauma as we have since September ",CheckATrade

Checkatrade gave me confidence to contact several plumbers for quotes and we had a great experience with R T Plumbing. However quote responses from other checkatrade firms was mixed.,CheckATrade

Plumber claimed to be from a family business. Unreliable work poor.  Replaced toilet (leaking).  Replaced a radiator (not heating up).  Was replacing shower.  Base and splash back fitted but shower drain not blocked off.  Now ceiling has collapsed into kitchen as bathroom sink been draining into floor space.  Also cut through gas pipe when removing old shower.  Didnâ€™t see him for three days so arranged for replacement plumber to complete work.

"Elson and his team were excellent and would highly recommend. They built a loft extension containing a bedroom, walk-in wardrobe, and bathroom within the expected completion time. I had only seen reviews online. However, from first meeting Elson and Edmund it was clear they were very knowledgeable and receptive. Their roofing work was superb. In fact the building inspector told me afterwards it was""the best he had seen"". Nothing was too much trouble and all of Elson's team were very skilled. Aftercare was excellent as well, e.g Elson came back to modify fire doors and other little bits.",CheckATrade
"Uncharitably I'm giving 1 star! This is my go to for most jobs I want doing. I've used it for a decorator, plumber, handyman and electrician. However it's frustrating that a simple task such as leaving a review is so difficult (bearing in mind this is a requirement to get a guarantee for a job done). It wouldn't allow me to submit a review because of the computation of my postcode. Despite every configuration it would not accept the submission. ",CheckATrade
"The platform is awash with fake reviews and incompetent careless trades people, use another service!DO NOT USE CHECKATRADE! Youâ€™ve been warned!Want to activate your guarantee? Checkatrade will do everything it can to void it and squirm out of assuring it.I recently had a bathroom renovation where the comms and review was done through Checkatrade, I submitted my job and awaited calls from various trades people.Unfortunately the electrical work carried out by the company doing My bathroom was horrendous and down right dangerous, I raised this with Checkatrade, and they refused to honour my guarantee stating the work was not done through Checkatrade, even though I can see the job message indications to trades when requests for quotes were originally sent out.The company that did my bathroom, is no longer on Checkatrade, funny that.My previous job history has been deleted by Checkatrade so that I can no longer see it aside from very a recent job. I can still see the review I left for the company that did my bathroom though.",CheckATrade
We needed a reliable plumber. Checkatrade suggested 3 local plumbers. I checked their reviews which were all good and contacted all of them.

"The plumber was very polite  respectful and explained everything he was doing in a way I could understand.Did exactly as he said he would on time. Also aftercare was excellent, he checked everything was working well. I would definitely recommend him to friends and family ",CheckATrade
Used a company for bathroom from check a trade and he was a scammer! Tiled directly to my floorboards and made several errors which meant I had to have the work done all over again. Check a trade offered NO support. All they care about is the fees they get from their traders.,CheckATrade
"The whole process from check a trade to job completion was excellent.

When using Checkatrade the process allows you to find trades easily. Downside is that trades say they are interested but don't come round to give you estimate. So you end up with going with one who did come round with no additional prices to compare. The company we did use completed there works and after there 3rd revisit fingers crossed have sorted out the roof leaks.,CheckATrade
I needed a plumber to buy and fit a front panel on my bath. Checkatrade sent me the names of a couple of plumbers willing to do my job and I went with one of them.

If i could give zero stars I would.  I used checkatrade to source a plumber when I had an emergency.  The plumbing company (Home Rescue Services in Wolverhampton) were abysmal and we were in excess of three months without a shower as they messed us about completely.  I finally resolved the challenges by using another plumber - only to find out that the diagnosis by Home Rescue Services was completely wrong - and when I reached out to Checkatrade with respect to their guarantee they have stated that as i did not write a review they cannot support me with any level of guarantee.  My supplier had not completed work so how can i write a review?????? Furthemore they have not addressed a range of questions that i have raised with respect to the vetting that they carried out  or verification of the previous reviews by customers for Home Rescue Services.   On a par with the supplier they recommended on their site.  No customer service from either.  Not even laughable.,CheckATrade

"The checks they run on traders don't seem to be very rigorous. I guess they prevent scammers, but not check if they're actually qualified to do the work. The review system doesn't work, as the trader had seemingly glowing reviews. I've had to abandon a job halfway (costing me significant extra money and the possibility of ripping up expensive materials) because the tradesman was not competent. Several critical steps were missed in the work, going against all common advice easily available online, which could result in future damage and repairs. The ""guarantee"" from checkatrade requires the tradesperson to have a go fixing it. Which is no good if fixing it requires ripping up hundreds of pounds of material and then having another crack at fitting hundreds pounds more material, which they may mess up again if they're not competent.I wanted some tiling done, and here are the issues found so far: Ordered (at my expense) 100kg of adhesive for just 8m2 of bathroom flooring. 5 bags instead of 2.Didn't tape seal the bathroom waterproof layer. Didn't edge seal the waterproof layer. Used a 6mm notch trowel for laying 45cm floor tiles, should be 12mm.Didn't applying adhesive in lines, resulting in air pockets and voids. Left massive gaps under the edges of the tiles laid so far, which could crack/break years down the line.None of this can be fixed, it needs to be replaced and fitted by an experienced person to avoid the possibility of costly repairs down the line.

"If you want immediate access to validated and trusted local traders to carry out various jobs and tasks inside and outside your home then the Checkatrade App is an absolute must have item!! I have used the Checkatrade services in the past but with the App now available this has taken the ease of usage to another level. I have recently moved to a new house and there are various jobs that need to be carried out and this is where the Checkatrade App services come into their own. Using the App I have been able to engage the services of expert and professional local traders for gutter and down pipe clearing and cleaning, jetting and cleaning of blocked drains and Gas Safe servicing and safety certification of a multi gas Gas Products, a gas oven hob and a gas fire. Also using the app I am seeking qualified local traders to undertake joinery works to doors, repairs and sealing of windows and a tidy up of the garden.

"The team did everything that they had promised very well and I am completely satisfied with the work done. They cleaned up afterwards and carted away the debris leaving no residue behind. They were helpful, cheerful and worked well as a team. I would recommend Aspect Drainage Solutions to anyone in the area who needs work on drains. One small point - when the appointment is being confirmed the office should point out that cheques cannot be accepted. I had a mad dash to the building society to cancel a cheque and transfer money between accounts. However this does not detract from the excellent service this company gave",CheckATrade
"I employed Unique Roofing and Guttering to repair a leak in the roof.  He spent about an hour in the loft and declared roof now sound.

According to his invoice he repointed Valleys despite the fact that I don't have any Valleys on my roof, repointed brickwork even though that can't be done from the loft and the roof still leaks.  When I paid him, the money went to a private bank account not a business one.  On further investigation, the company does not appear to actually exist and is not registered for VAT.  I had thought that using Trust a Trader that I could count on the workman being genuine and not a Cowboy just out to scam vulnerable people out of as much money as possible.

"The first plumber wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really interested in doing the job! said he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the right tap etc on his van.week later another plumber came to do the repair and was totally different, he was excellent knew what was needed and completed the repair in no time, a competent plumber in every way a credit to your company.",HomeServe
"You sent a plumber who had no parts said he would order a new cartridge if not a new bath tap. I gave him the make and model of the tap so he could get the cartridge.After some time you send another plumber who hasn't got a cartridge or a tap! Waited in all day turned up at 17,30 not happy simple job!",HomeServe
"I had a very polite engineer attend our Property this morning that I wanted to thank, the call out was in Meads Eastbourne. It was due to a suspected water leak on our meter. I had expected the call out to be cancelled due to horrendous weather but he arrived right on time and After a hour the Homeserve engineer dug up a hole to expose the pipes supplying our property with water to carry out his checks and from here managed to located the issue. Something south east water would not do. Absolutely Fantastic service, he was extremely helpful and informative. Could not fault the service we received. Five stars from me.",HomeServe
"Leaking tap new parts fitted, Happy customer",HomeServe
Dealt with promptly over phone and plumbers turned and dealt promptly with problem,HomeServe
got through on phone quickly initially to agent - no long queues.Plumber was pleasant and efficient and had problem sorted quite quickly,HomeServe
"I have had plumbing/drainage insurance with Homeserve for 3 years now, and can honestly say it is the best insurance investment I have ever made.Have had to call them twice, once for an underground external pipe leak, and more recently for in internal leak.Both times I got through immediately to very pleasant and helpful agents.(Their CTi system actually WORKS, so they knew who I was just from my mobile number! I cannot say how rare that is, and I work in the Contact Centre industry!!!)Both times they have immediately booked engineers to come out the next day!And both engineers called me in the am to confirm rough 1hr window for their arrival time, then called to confirm exact time, arrived promptly and found and fixed the issue on the same visit.Their engineers both were pleasant, polite, and cleaned up beautifully (one relaid and washed my patio flagstones after having to dig several 3ft holes to find the leaking pipe!!)I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recommend this company more highly.",HomeServe
Effecient and quick service though still a slight leak,HomeServe
Homeserve were able to be on site within 24 hours of the problem being reported. They arrived when they promised and fixed the pipework quickly and efficiently.,HomeServe
"Great Plumber, knew his job.",HomeServe

Quick response and the plumber was very knowledgeable about his job,HomeServe
"In high winds the toilet stack detached 21nd December. No toilet upstairs and no bath/sink/shower (luckily downstairs toilet unaffected). Member of household with mobility problems. Contacted Homeserve same day. Plumber came same day. I knew he wouldn't be able to fix it as it would involve going up a ladder. He couldn't fix it. We phoned a few times in the following days, but no scaffolding available until 2nd Jan. It's 3rd January, and no further attempts to fix it or contact me have been made. Phoned today and still no fix booked. Scaffolders won't answer the phone. Still no prospect of a fix. Probably a 'few more days' before homeserve get in contact again.Pros:Everyone I've spoken to who represent Homeserve have been very nice.Cons:Two weeks (so far) without a fix over Xmas is not nice.",HomeServe
"I had a leak from my bath tap, Homeserve fixed the leak, but took my old shower head and shower holder without replacing the shower holder.Happy with the fixed leak, not happy having to spend extra to buy a replacement shower holder.",HomeServe
Plummer arrived on time and fixed the leaking pipe .  Friendly and professional.  Left everything clean and tidy,HomeServe
Plumber arrived on the time stated and was very polite and friendly. Done a really good job. Very pleased,HomeServe
Eventually fixed the leak and all the spoil left on my drive. Was told this would be gone within 3 days . 2 weeks later it still has not been picked up. Have phoned several times and been told it will be gone soon.,HomeServe
"Speedy service - plumber arrived earlier than expected. Problem resolved quickly and efficiently. Friendly, professional service",HomeServe
"We had a leaking pipe and therefore had no water or heating for 24 hours. However, a Homeserve engineer came out to us the next day and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently. We were very happy with the service, both on the phone when we initially contacted Homeserve about the problem and when the engineer came out to us. The engineer explained everything very well and was extremely helpful.",HomeServe
Dealt with plumbing in time for Christmas. Thankyou.,HomeServe
"It took three visits for the job to be completed. (2 sets of taps to be replaced).Mainly through lack of communication. I then had to call them back as discovered the tap joint had been leaking whilst we were away,leaving a very wet carpet, Apparently the old O ring had not been replaced , hence allowing it to leak.( First visit 29th Nov, could only temporarily mend. Second visit 6th Dec.had no replacement taps.Third visit, 13th Dec, only had taps to do the jobs when i asked him if he had them,when he called to say he was on the way,he was not aware of this and had to get them on the his way.)",HomeServe
Had to come back as toilet was still leaking but did his best to get it sorted customer service was brill,HomeServe
Excellent quick response very friendly experienced plumber who completed job Good communication,HomeServe
We had a quick response to clear an outside blocked drain,HomeServe
"I had a water leak coming from an area which connected the water feed inlet to the washing machine and dishwater and it was leaking water everywhere under the kitchen sink.Since I was with homeserve I logged on to their website and booked a visit from one of their engineers for a next day appointment.The engineer arrived within the stated time frame and found the problem very quickly. Since he did not have the exact plastic part replacement which had split, he created two separate connectors out of copper pipe with two separate shut off valves which is 100 percent better than it was.He was quick, professional and very polite. I could not recommend homeserve highly enough as I doubt I would have managed to get a plumber out until the new year.",HomeServe
"Within 4 hours of phoning for someone to fix my tap, the plumber arrived and rectified the problem. I was expecting to wait until at least after the weekend for someone to come. There was no mess and the plumber explained what the problem was and swiftly fixed it.",HomeServe
We experienced problems with our downstairs toilet and water was gushing out. We contacted HomeServe immediately. We were notified that a Plumber was going to visit between 7 to 10 p.m. The Plumber rung and said he was on his way. Hooray!,HomeServe
Efficient service for leaking tap. Very satisfied,HomeServe
"I'm still waiting for a reply to my complaint. Paid Ã‚Â£30 and a plumber turned up. Decided there was nothing wrong with the toilet and went away. It doesn't flush paper, the 'pusher' is clearly broken and it refills when it is not being used. Hmm",HomeServe
"Disappointing first visit as although leaking problem resolved , a new issue arose directly from faulty repair. Second visit postponed twice affecting my ability to leave the house for a day and a half.Technicians however wree very professional and curtious, in spite of doing the wrong thing initially.However I am happy that the issue has been resolved.",HomeServe
"We had a leak from the toilet, rang customer services who were very helpful. An engineer arrived within a hour, fixed quickly - excellent service.",HomeServe
Sink unblocked quickly,HomeServe
"I called HomeServe on 27th Dec about a broken pipe and got an appointment for 28th between 8 and 6. Plumber came at 2pm, assessed the job,  went for a part, fitted it competently and left.  Was very polite and friendly, efficient and neat. Much appreciated.",HomeServe
I had a problem with a leak but was uncertain where it was coming from. The plumber immediately identified the source of the problem and solved it in an efficient and friendly manner.,HomeServe
Plumber arrived on time and did an excellent job of unblocking my bath and sink waste pipes.,HomeServe
"I cannot praise Homeserve enough. After an initial visit, the engineer ordered a new water tank and rather than just patching up the old tank, organised another visit at my convenience and replaced a very old metal cold water tank for a brand new plastic one. Work was performed when they said it would be, with minimal mess. They hoovered up after work and also emailed homeserve so that they could collect the old tank at a later date. that They had to do additional work to get the cupboard door to the tank open as it hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been used for many years and had been painted over.Engineer was very polite and courteous telling me what they were doing at various stages of the job. I felt confident that the work had been carried out professionally and to high standards. It is such a good service to pay Ã‚Â£30 and then have all of this work completed as it would have cost considerably more, had I had to have it completed outside of the scheme .",HomeServe
We had a blockage in our bathroom.  Someone came out very quickly and it was fixed very quickly.  Excellentservice,HomeServe
Prompt service. Efficient pleasant plumber who fixed the problem. Great service,HomeServe
John was brilliant!   So. Proffesional and reassuring in what proved to be a very awkward job. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d had a flooded kitchen coming through the lights from the bathroom above.  The tank and fittings are built in so although he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reach it he returned with Paul to help him dismantle it. He found a further leak which they repaired and replaced everything back and no mess.  Brilliant service thank you. Dec,HomeServe
"Phoned yesterday ,engineer arrived first thing this morning.  He was a very  Professional plumber.  He showed great care and did a brilliant job",HomeServe
"The ones that came to do the toilet and radiator where very  helpful, polite it was a pleasure having them, but the last one 1 star just didn't seem interested quickest bodge jobs hecould do to get away, ptfe  tape round a plastic pippe, then cable ties to hold the pipe in place very shoddy work in my opinion.",HomeServe
"ON 13 DECEMBER ,we had a mixer tap inthe kitchen replaced it was not shutting off,constantly dripping,the chap who changed it was very good,I am sorry I have not got his name,but Homeserve have been very good and very happy with the replacement tap,many thanks.",HomeServe
On time and carried out the job of fixing 3 taps quickly. He also provided advice on how to avoid similar problems in the future.,HomeServe
"Plumbers are professional .helpful, well mannered,arrive when they say they will and make no mess!",HomeServe
Quick service. Work speedily completed. My only concern is that I would have preferred to speak to a person rather than a Ã¢â‚¬ËœrobotÃ¢â‚¬Â when arranging an  appointment. It took me two attempts as on the first my request for a plumber was misinterpreted as reporting a gas leak!!,HomeServe
"I contacted HomeServe to mend a dripping pipe, the appointment was easy to make.  The leaking pipe was repaired and the engineers were polite and helpful.",HomeServe
"Your Engineer, Adam, came on schedule.He gave helpful advice about blocked drain, which is now repaired. Repairing noisy water supply to downstairs toilet he said needed a plumber.",HomeServe
already have pluming and signed up for electrics as I hav been happy with the plumbing cover,HomeServe
"The best part of this experience was that I could ask Home Serve to come at my time of asking as to which they duly obliged, twenty  minutes before my appointment time, the plumber/maintenance chap rang me to say he was on his way, true to his word, he was at my door step bang on time. The job itself ( overflow pipe leak in loft ) took approx. half an hour with all new parts administered. The gentleman himself was nice and pleasant, a lovely man. Final words = Very pleased and satisfied with the whole experience. Thankyou Home Serve.",HomeServe
Great service and an experienced plumber was sent to fix our leaking toilet. The only downside of this was that the plumber let us know the time about half an hour before his arrival at our property. When we booked him through insurance we were told that he will arrive any time between 8:00 and 18:00.,HomeServe
"Well...he came,but to stop my leaking tap he said he had to go behind dishwasher so couldn't do it",HomeServe
Tom the plumber was very professional helpful and extremely efficient. He fully explained the problem solved it very quickly and replaced the parts with no issues. I rang the office previously to say how pleasant courteous he was.,HomeServe
"The HomeServe plumber sent to fix my issue was approachable and considerate, diligent and competent. Even though the issue turned out to be difficult to resolve and consequently more time consuming, the plumber couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been more helpful. 10/10.  I was relieved I had HomeServe cover.",HomeServe
"A tap in the bathroom was not working properly. It could sometimes be turned on, but then could could not be turned off; at other times the reverse was the case.The shower at the same time seemed to be defunct. The engineer found a new shower head, and solved the problem-this saved me a lot of money, and I am very happy about that!The same tap is now leaking, though, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  not properly fixed.",HomeServe
The initial response and follow up from Homeserve were faultless.As was the work carried out by your contractor.The communication from the contractor was less impressive.We were without hot water for 3 weeks while a replacement tank was acquired and no useful update information was provided.That apart the contractor's plumbers were also impressive,HomeServe
"Took over two weeks to arrange a repair to a collapsed drain. Contractor didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn up, rebooked but they sent the wrong man. HomeServe told me they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t contact the contractor but would keep trying. I rang and got through straight away. Now booked in for next week, so thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 3 weeks without use of a toilet or washing machine . Appalling service",HomeServe
The engineer was very througher and identified the water leak problem straight away.  He also checked all the pipes in my loft.,HomeServe
"Automated claim process was very easy to use (no waiting in a call queue to speak to an agent). Engineer booking also easy and appointment progress sent to mobile phone to keep you up to date. Engineers very friendly and efficient. My job turned out to be more complicated then a simple blocked drain and required digging out and a replacement gully. All work was carried out to a high standard, very happy with the service.",HomeServe
"We found a leak on our toilet last night,I phoned straight away and got booked in for today between 8 and 1,a very nice young man arrived at 12 a hour and a half later we was leak free,can't fault the service we received thank you",HomeServe
Excellent and prompt serviceGood and friendly plumber,HomeServe
The response to my problem was resolved quickly and efficiently. The plumber arrived well within the allocated timeframe and phone prior to his arrival and was courteous and efficient. Well done !,HomeServe

"I had a blocked and broken outside drain.  Booked a morning slot for engineer back in October, arranged for someone to take my son to school.  They phoned around 10.30 to change to afternoon slot 1pm till 6pm.  Arranged for someone to pick my son up from school.  At 5.45pm, my phone rang once  then only, then cut off and straight away I received a text saying they'd tried to get hold of me and that the engineer wasn't coming. Waste of my day off work.  Rescheduled and engineer came at 8am, unblocked drain and said I would hear from them about fixing the drain.  3 months later, I contact them as still haven't heard when drain is being repaired, and am told an engineer just needs to come and 'assess' the drain.  I arrange for them to come on my day off, am given a slot from 8am till 6pm, I arrange for neighbours to take my son to school and pick him up so I don't miss the engineer at all, I contact Homeserve around 2pm just to confirm the engineer is still coming and am told they will call me on route, 6pm comes and goes, no engineer, no phone call, text or email to say they are not coming.  Nothing.  Another whole day wasted.  Now I will have to go through the whole waiting in all day yet again.  Please, at least have the courtesy to inform customers that no one is coming, it's one phone call!",HomeServe
Brilliant from start to finish. Leaking bathroom taps were rectified quickly and professionally. Dale was a lovely man who certainly know his job.The booking agents were also polite and extremely helpful. Great job thankyou.,HomeServe
"Plumber arrived as scheduled ironed out problem advised on cause , cleaned up and left without any hassle",HomeServe
Easy contact...quick response.....professional attitude at both call centre and from plumber who came to fix the problem,HomeServe
"The experience was great talking out Plumbing & Electrics was straightforward and easy to do, gives you pease of mind knowing that you are covered.",HomeServe
It should be a very simple matter of changing a bog standard cartridge on a dripping tap. Instead of the only available offer of purchasing a new tap and having HomeServe install it,HomeServe
The men came to do the drainThe weather was cold and raining They dug the path up and located the problemThey blew it clear with a pressure hoseThey cleaned up and bagged everything to be collected a few days laterGreat service,HomeServe
"We needed a swift response and in the end got it.Initially no plumber available for five days but eventually, after some negotiation, one came and fixed the problem on the evening of the next day.We were delighted.",HomeServe
Prompt and excellent service once again from Homeserve. The plumber was first class,HomeServe
"The plumber came on time, was very polite and friendly and repaired the dripping tap and adjusted the taps above and beyond.",HomeServe
"Before  Christmas I phoned ,because we had a leak ,which later ,as a man came round to confirm this,said we would be contacted in 2 days,No 4 days later I called,saying when is someone coming round to mend it,whether we were entilted to claim or not.She would get in contact with the contractor. I told her my husband has serious lung cancer.Nothing again no word,so  got a independent plumber to do it,my husband and I changed the bowls of water everyday,we didn't hear from anyone and still haven't. What's the use of having insurance.",HomeServe
"The initial request for help was dealt with in an efficient and friendly manner, and the plumber arrived promptly and was very friendly and got the job done very efficiently.",HomeServe
Excellent. Appointments made with plumbers quickly and problems explained clearly. Very polite and professional.15/11/23. 14/12/23. 16/11/23,HomeServe
"Never good to have a plumbing problem on Christmas Day, nonetheless after making our own temporary fix, I called HomeServe on Boxing Day to report the problem.  The call centre answered swiftly and raised the call as an Emergency. Within a couple of hours, the engineer called and we agreed that it wasn't an emrgency and it could wait until the following day. Following day a plumber was round and replaced the faulty part in the toilet cistern. At all times communication was excellent, no fuss, just a job well done. Thanks!",HomeServe
"Good service, experienced plumber and fixed problemRecommended",HomeServe
"Adam arrived on time, and sorted out our plumbing problem in under an hour. He was cheerful as well as efficient.",HomeServe
"Called out to repair leaking toilet soil pipe connection, replaced flexible connector pipe and refixed toilet to floor. ALSO carried out 2 addittional jobs that he found needed doing while he was here, 1, replaced cistern ball valve. 2, replaced kitchen sink taps that were faulty & corroded.Saved me having to call them back again at a later date,RIO was extremely helpful !",HomeServe
"I reported a water leak on 4th Dec 23. Plumber called early evening, but couldn't do anything. By this time the leak had stopped. He returned next day early evening to try to `seal` the leaking area. He returned two days later to find the `sealing job` had failed. He returned next day to try to seal the leak again, but I declined this repeated `try`. Two more plumbers called the next week on 14/12/23 to sort the problem. They arrived at 9-00 am and left at 10-30 am. When I checked their work after I found that where a new waste pipe had been fitted through an outside wall, there was a 5 mm gap all around which had not been sealed, allowing insects, etc to crawl through. The same waste pipe did not connect to the outside drain and was offset by 50mm. Back inside and under the bath it was found that the new overflow pipe was not connected to anything and was sealed off with some `filler` inside the pipe. No effort was made to reposition the bath side panel which was initially removed by the original plumber. All in all, this was a blunder from the start. I was able to enlist the help of a neighbour to rectify some of the works, but it is still not finished yet. This is dated 8th January 2024.",HomeServe
The engineer managed to pinpoint the  source of the leeking water.So grateful for this.Thanks,HomeServe
On 30 Dec 2023 an engineer visited my house after I had submitted a claim. He advised I have a leak and would be requesting a leak detection visit. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now been 10 days and still not received an update. A surprising lack of urgency when considering engineer assessment.   Andrew,HomeServe
"Exterior drain problem, called Sunday evening, appointment arranged for Tuesday. Plumber arrived at stated time - dealt with inside issues, initial confusion with customer reception. Appointment immediately rearranged by plumber for following early morning. Excellent man, quickly diagnosed and fixed the problem,explained the sewage treatment plant and gave us helpful advice re maintenance. Very happy with HomeServe, saved us money with policy and time searching for independent contractors.",HomeServe
"Dreadful. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve paid for YEARS for my Ã¢â‚¬Å“coverÃ¢â‚¬Â and the 2 times IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve called to ask for plumbing help - strangely the policy doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover it. I have drainage and plumbing cover and yet the leak thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been worsening and worsening ISNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T covered. HOW is that not a plumbing issue?! I just need a new seal replacing! The Engineer I had visit in the Summer advised me to buy completely the wrong part for a broken mixer tap (even pulled up the image on Amazon as a reference) then returned to discover his initial scan of the problem was insufficient and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d advised me incorrectly. I have wasted money with purchasing incorrect items suggested by your Ã¢â‚¬ËœexpertsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and have ended up paying for independent plumbers to do the work anyway! Why have a policy at all?! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a total false economy. Homeserve have taken hundreds, if not thousands off me and yet nothing is covered. No doubt youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll reply with some lip service but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve cancelled my policy as you are a total waste of time.",HomeServe
"So easy to get an appointment and the plumber was good, sorted the blockage quickly. Would recommend as so difficult to find reliable plumbers nowadays.",HomeServe
The staff was very polite. He checked all possible areas of blockage and we felt satisfied with his assessment. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll call him again.,HomeServe
"It took 2 people from HOMESERVE to figure out the reason my toilet was not flushing away completely. Not including the original person who fitted my toilet several years ago.There was no blockage in the toilet, as the previous professional had suspected. The last and final visit by a plumbing expert was that the cistern just needed to be adjusted slightly to increase the level of water, a little more that it was at the time of the appointment.It flushes so much better, first time whereas before you would have to flush least 3 times to clear the toilet bowl even when there was very little toilet paper present.The HOMESERVE professionals were prompt polite, friendly and very knowledgeable. Thank you so much to both HOMESERVE engineers.",HomeServe
Was fine engineer could not come. Office didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say until evening was a bit inconvenient.Thanks but as of 8/1/24 they have not come to fix it yet but hopefully it will be soon so sorry Leah but the Job has not yet been done.Update: Engineer came and did a fine job of repair.,HomeServe
"I have used Homeserve for several years now and most recently I had an issue with a leaking Speedfit connector this time in my kitchen ceiling and wall. I pay around Ã‚Â£200 annually plus Ã‚Â£30 per call out, and I think this is both good value and great service. Plumbers quote Ã‚Â£70 per hour typically plus call-out, so my need today would have been more than I paid annually. I went online to make the claim and had a booking within minutes. After I chatted online the emergency was escalated, as I had no water whilst I had a leak, to SAME DAY call-out by Homeserve own team, not a local plumber as before. Very impressed. Plumber came earlier than scheduled, fixed the issue and all is good. Within 2 hours. Very Happy, very consistent service, and very hard to fault. Thank you!",HomeServe
Had a major leak through the ceiling due to pipe leak in bathroom. Rang straight away and paid  the Ã‚Â£30 excess. Was then told that it would be about 24 to 30 hours before a plumber would get to me. This forced me to use a local plumber. Lost the ceiling due to the delay. Homeserve  said send in the bill so I did. They paid Ã‚Â£60 as a good will gesture stating the fact that I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t had the policy for a year and they hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t authorised me getting a plumber in. Have cancelled the policy,HomeServe
Had a water leak with the downstairs toilet and a blocked drain. Someone came called David who unblocked the drain and also repaired the pipe in the toilet which was not suppose to be his job but a plumber could not come straight away to fix the toilet and he did not want to leave me with no water facilities. Dave is an absolute legend and he saved the day thank you so much Dave will never forget how much you help us and what a nice guy you are. Thank you again,HomeServe
"The gentleman who did our blockage phoned beforehand and gave an estimated time. Was right on time! He talked me through his work, which resulted in an unblocked pipe!  I am pleased with his work.",HomeServe
Easy booking and pleasant man came and fixed the loo.,HomeServe
Quick and efficient service. Fixed broken toilet with parts already on the engineers van,HomeServe
Issue not covered and engineer rude. Put in complaint & told would be contacted by phone in 3-5 days. Still nothing.Filled in form online but when engineer arrived told mixer taps in shower not covered (although if over a bath on a shower would be?!) Could have saved wasting all our time if simply pointed out at tome of claim that showers wernt covered,HomeServe
Call centre listened to problem & made an appointment which was the next day. The plumber quickly identified the problem and resolved the issue and double checked his own work. I was truly impressed . A very happy customer,HomeServe

We had a leaking overflow pipe which came out promptly to repair not only did you make the problem worse you then caused a leak in the house!The next day we waited until 8.45pm for another engineer to come out to do the repairs!

"I contacted the helpline to question why I had been sent a letter regarding my external drain system, as it was my responsibility.I have coverage for this and when I rang up the person on the other end agreed. the letter could be ignored.To me, as a 83 year old, receiving this letter could have been a concern. Fortunately I am still able to reason. The issue is, the need for this letter was not warranted, could have caused distress and panic.Can we stop the 25 year olds running things and get some real adults in the business.",HomeServe
"I had an emergency leak in the airing cupboard on Christmas day - quite a severe leak.  Homeserve were able to provide an engineer, even on Christmas day.  He was called Adam and he was very cheerful and helpful.",HomeServe

"Living in the middle of Wales we are used to having to wait for service but this morning HomeServe way exceeded expectations. We had an issue where the water level in our toilet dropped dramatically and assumed something was amiss inside the cistern. Unable to check inside ourselves as modern flush fitted unit rather than the old fashioned type where it was easy to lift the lid and check what was wrong, we called HomeServe to see if this was something they could help with under the terms of our policy. It was. Within three hours of us calling a lovely helpful gent called Peter came, checked out the problem - turns out it was the drain - sorted it, spotted that our outside tap was leaking and after a call to HomeServe replaced that too! Five star service without a doubt. Thank you so much.",HomeServe
The plumber came as scheduled and completed the job well,HomeServe
Easy to set up plumbing cover  via website,HomeServe
"30th December the toilet packed in, wouldn't flush. Not the best time of year to falter. I was relieved to find that once I reported it online to homeserve an engineer was available the same day. Engineer arrived mid afternoon and quickly assessed the fault before completely changing the internal workings of the cistern. What a great job, the engineer was very polite and tided up after the job was finished. The toilet flushes better now than it ever did. Thank you",HomeServe
I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what i expected.i rung to report a leak and the man came looked at the shower and said it was because the glass shower didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go over the tiles and that was it he left. Fetched my builder in he agreed but also found a leak under the bath. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know I thought homeserve would have fixed it ??????,HomeServe
Plumber very polite and helpful. Problem was sorted very quickly,HomeServe
"The engineer didn't even look for the leak, just gave me a load of rubbish. 1. The issue may or may or not be associated with the faulty installation.2. As a competent Aircraft test engineer my self for 39years I believe it's more likely to be the overflow from the bath. If he bother to look as I have the seal around the bath overflow is damaged and needs to be replaced. I have a seal from b&q just unable to crawl under the bath at the present time, as I have a severe back problem, which the chiro is slowly sorting, maybe Feb/mar I'll be able.Not much point in having insurance if they don't  what to do the job , as I said the engineer couldn't be bother, just paying for coming out.I know it was the weekend before Christmas but I went to work in the afternoon and actually worked a full half day shift.Yours sincerely ( fed up with wasters )GRC, BA(Hons) Maths & Computing, HND aero Eng, MRAeS, Major Test Specialist & STEM Ambassador (Retd) ,PhD student reading astrophysics.",HomeServe

Was messed about many of times for the job to be fixed I think there were about 4 plumbers who turn up and wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t able to repair the issues,HomeServe
"Amazing service from start to finish. Easy to log the problem , got a phone call within half an hour to say that plumber was on his way. So quick, tidy and pleasant. Would highly recommend",HomeServe
"Excellent company.   A non emergency sink leak was repaired within hours of calling them, very impressed.  Friendly staff.  Highly recommend.",HomeServe
"The automated booking system was easy to use, and worked efficiently, although it could have allowed space for a more detailed description of the problem.The plumbers who dealt with my water leak were excellent - considerate, helpful and efficient. I was especially grateful for their help as the leak happened over the Christmas period, but the repair was done quickly in spite of this.",HomeServe

A quick response to blocked drains and a flooding threat. Came the same day. Worked in the dark but did exactly what they said they would do. Friendly and very efficient service. Could not fault them and would recommend them to anyone.,HomeServe
"Great service , lovely gentleman fixed our leak and gave good advice for future repairs",HomeServe
"He arrived on time, found the leak under the driveway within 20 minutes, dug a hole, and replaced the old black pipe with the new blue pipe. Found a second leak. Everything was put back and tarmacked over within a couple of hours. Extremely impressed.",HomeServe
"The plumber was on time, very helpful and efficient.  Had the blockage fixed in a short time He had been delayed but I was informed in plenty of time of the appointment change",HomeServe
"The system worked well, with just one issue which was the earliest time available for the Engineer to visit being   four days. Luckily we didn't have an absolute emergency but I don't know if it would have been different if it was a burst pipe or something urgent. Engineer came on time as scheduled and fixed the issue, so no complaints there at all.",HomeServe
The Water Engineer was excellent both technically and his customer service,HomeServe
Had the Plumber out to fix dripping from the back of the toilet.  Took it fully apart and replaced everything from the Flush to the seals.  Good job done and all sorted.,HomeServe
"1st 2 guys that came together, seemed as though they didn't want to do the job,offered me cream taps on a stainless steel sink ,said that's all they do.poor service....2nd engineer  that came was very good.Even went to get the stainless steel taps.very nice guy.",HomeServe
"There where three things wrong with our wash after AO fitted it, one the inlet pipe  thread was crossed causing it to leak in our cupboard. That was fixed so we thought, then the outlet pipe was blocked you came and did that, then finally the out pipe for central heating was not put back right causing that to flood.  All in all Homeserve came out three times to fix problem that AO caused",HomeServe
"The a.m appointment, as agreed and communicated, was not kept by the engineer. I had to wait all day (had to cancel other appointments I had scheduled for the afternoon)No apologies was offered when he eventually turned up for the job. Lastly, the problem was not fixed as the system was blocked the following day and I has to rebook another appointment which to sort it out.",HomeServe
"Had to call back as there was a small problem with the routeing of the repaired overflow pipe. Plumber spent some time ensuring that new pipe work was installed. New ballcock results in very audible water flow noise, advised that this is normal. Is there a solution using a appropriate flow orifice?",HomeServe
Excellent value cover for plumbing and drainage for the 1st year,HomeServe
Bad quality replacement to what we had nd in response the engineer was saying the price of tap,HomeServe
"Recent plumbing problem call out and as usual, Homeserve engineer was courteous, knowledgeable and top notch. Blockage quickly cleared and he even showed me the problem on the camera. The online appointment booking process is easy and you even get a call from the engineer when he is on the way. I have used Homeserve a few times and each experience is the same. Excellent service!",HomeServe
Excellent and thorough service from the plumbing engineer. Solved the problem with minimum fuss. Especially helpful given the problem was over the Xmas period.,HomeServe

Very good website Easy way to ask for assistance Engineer arrived as requested Fixed leaking tapsDid not replace the taps even if I paid for them.Tap handle already working loose.With the special offer this was a very good company to deal with but not if I was paying the full price,HomeServe
"I have only had to use Homeserve on a few occasions but each time I have been greatly impressed with the service they have given me.We recently had a problem with a blocked downstairs toilet and utility room which share the same foul waste pipe. I called Homeserve and gave details to the automated Hannah Bot and within 4 hours of placing the call an engineer arrived to investigate. A subsequent visit was necessary but within 48hrs the problem had been fully resolved for me. The engineer's were polite, friendly and very professional in clearing the blockage and I am so glad I have an emergency policy with Homeserve.Excellent service all-round.",HomeServe
I had 2 leaky taps and I was disappointed that th engineer said he could only do one as its company policy. Is what it is. He changed one tap altogether so I was pleased with it even tho I have to phone again to get them out so another 30 quid charge.,HomeServe
Plumber came within a few hours and sorted the problem.,HomeServe
"bought a plumbing protection policy through the website and it was quick and easy to do, received confirmation via an email straight away and set up an online account,no problems.",HomeServe
Your plumber made quite sure there had been no leak and that mt problems had probably been due to standing water.,HomeServe
"There was a problem with my sewage pipes which made everything very smelly.  Because the problem seemed to be within the house, I rang s professional company to come. They told me outsid pipeswrtr broken would need a new lining snd the outside pipe would have to be extended up and around my thatched roof which would be very ugly.  Now that the problem appeared to be an outside affair, I rang Home Serve. They came very quickly.They assessed the problem which was very simple.They saw no problem with the waste pipe under the drive nor the any problem with the outside pipe.  I was very relieved not to have to do major things for the house.  The person who came was very helpful, direct and efficient. He was told me what I needed to hear and it was fair and honest. Wonderful. Thank you, Home Serve.",HomeServe
Although we had to wait 4 days because of Christmas holidays on arrival it was found that the main outlet was full to the brim and it did take some time for it to clear. It seems we have the waste from several houses pass through this drain. Excellent work done by the man who attended.,HomeServe
My parents had a faulty tap! I spoke to the call centre who were very understanding about my parents circumstances and prioritised them. Engineer called in advance and tap was replaced within 3 hours. Great service and efficient and polite engineer!,HomeServe
"I was delighted with the prompt service I got on December 30th .

"i went through a reply from Amy of homeserve which does not at all satisfy my claimi was offered a new VALIANT ECHO boiler by Homeserve - survey by ED second name i do not remember sales person who sold me the new boiler gave me all sort of advantages one of the it was i do not have to worry about renewing my contract with Homeserve (Policy No. 452110907 since more than 20 years and has absolutely loyal customer and prior to then i was under the cover of THREE VALLEY under their commencing TV15712 12588397 since 1991) as i was automatically covered for 5 years.i was extremely happy with old Valiant Boiler however i was coned to buy a new one Homeserve has cheated me is there a financial Conduct Authority i can this affair so that you are candid with your sales tactics i am sure Homeserve must have recorded my telephone discussion with the person who sold me this new boiler. Having spoken to the technical dept of Valiant i was informed that there was nothing wrong with my new boiler and having giving them what appeared on the panel ""Safety Switch Off - Low Pressure"" bar showed below minimum level i was told that the problem was with leaking pipes. I report a claim with HS against my policy 583616339 i was given claim ref CAS-558250 and engineer visited after 5 days  and he took only 10-15 minutes checking outer piping (there was stain underneath the bathtub which showed below kitchen cealing he spoke for a long time from his van to HS and i was told this problem was microleakage requiring sealing by chemical compound and can only be done by HS Heating Engineers.In order to resolve this issue i am prepared to pay 25% of the cost of pouring chemical which as per HS plumber would take only 5-10 minutes and the chemical would cost around Ã‚Â£20.00.please resolve this issue and improve your sales tactics",HomeServe
Engineer was friendly and very helpful and fixed the problem in about an hour The only downside was that the response took 24 hours before the engineer arrived. This was for a call with leaking water from the loft of a 2 storey house,HomeServe
"Asked them to repair a leak didn't know where it was coming from shower base or where. They said it wasn't covered and fob me off got independent plumber who found leak was from pipe going to the shower head dug a hole in the wall and sorted it after 2 days trail and error in finding where the issue was as, water leaked into my kitchen from above. It cost me around Ã‚Â£200 to sort it. Certainly not happy with the way home serve had fobbed me off  I've been worn them several years. I won't be renewing my policy this time  the date given is probably wrong as can't remember it.",HomeServe
"Arranging an appointment on-line was quick and straightforward, and a slot was available from the next day. The engineer called in advance, as promised, and turned up promptly. The job was done with no hassle and the leaking pipe secured with a comprehensive fix. Very satisfied.",HomeServe
Great introductory offer on Plumbing & Drains for first 12 months.Easy application process via internet..,HomeServe
"Very nice, polite and enthusiastic man came to my rescue to fix my leaky pipe. Job done without fuss and very efficiently. Thank you",HomeServe
The engineer dug two deep holes to repair a leaking supply pipe at the appointed time,HomeServe
I have already answered this before but once again I have been more than satisfied with HomeServe as you sorted out an ongoing problem with a water leak that couldn't be found and the two men who came were able to solve the problem for which I was so very pleased and grateful.  I have called on your services before and have always found HomeServe very prompt and very professional.,HomeServe
"Excellent service sorting blocked drains, friendly and helpful staff! Thank you",HomeServe
Your Plummer quickly identified the problem arranged the spares delivery and another operative came on time and quickly fitted the replacement parts.Excellent service particularly over the Christmas period.,HomeServe
Lie to over 3 day 4 missed appointments advised they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it and I needed to call my waste water company as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shared line and they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch it and they come out within 12 hours I would advise to anyone using them to not waste there time and money,HomeServe
Easy to take out a plumbing policy and good communication,HomeServe
"Just taken out a policy to cover leaking pipes etc at a brilliant price, really straightforward on the website will definitely recommend.",HomeServe
I told them the make and model of the tap and they send the wrong parts. I rang them to say the wrong parts have arrived and they still sent a plumber. I then printed out a pitcher of the tap assembly instructions for the cartridge and a part number and price of the cartridge. I wait with baited breath!,HomeServe
"Engineer arrived on time, Worked in the rain to dig up front drive, located and fixed leaking mains supply pipe. restored drive and tidied up when he finished. Excellent service.",HomeServe
"A leaky pipe is always a horror to deal with but Homeserve sorted it out really quickly, at a time I wanted. The engineer was quick and professional Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ just what you would expect.",HomeServe
"From initial contact to making a claim to arranging date and time of visit from plumber and plumber arriving and identifying what caused the water leak and repairing, the whole process was trouble free and we were fully satisfied with the service. Thoroughly recommend.",HomeServe
"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so impressed with the response from Home Serve in finding a leak within my home. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve visited multiple times over the past few weeks, and considering the minimal Ã‚Â£30 excess I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe how much work has been done. Following my first call, they were at the property within 60 minutes and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m certain that when they return later this week the problem will finally be resolved. The plumbing and drainage cover is well worth the cost!",HomeServe
"Blocked downstairs toilet and drains. Excellent fast service, no problems at all. Came out with a few hours. Would highly recommend Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’",HomeServe
The guy that came to our drains was brilliant,HomeServe
"Your man turned up, opened the outside drain came back and said itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Anglian waters problem.  I paid Ã‚Â£30.00 for the privilege.  I told him that the toilet wasBlocked solid but he just said. Without looking it Anglian waters problemI amStill waiting for Anglian water but in the meantime  theMobile home and my bathroom both  flooded with stinking soiledWaterI asked another company to come in and he opened upThe drain nearest the house to find it blockedSolid.  Spent an afternoon unblocking and sorting it out for me at a further costOf Ã‚Â£250.    This was carried out yesterdayI will be contacting homeserve to complain and seek compensation for the overflow and cleaning of the house and maybe damageToThe bathroom in the mobile So no. I am not happy",HomeServe
Overflow in toilet cistern was leaking onto garage roof and coming through into garage. Phoned Homeserve quite late in the day and they were there within the hour and fixed it. Excellent service,HomeServe
"Had a leak just after Christmas, wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too sure where it was coming from. Paid the excess and a plumber came that day. He checked the bathroom and said no all fine and I needed a roofer. The roofer came, did the same checks and instantly found it was the toilet leaking. Suffice to say I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t very happy that Homeserve didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do anything or found the problem yet my roofer did instantly. But of a waste of excess that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never see again!",HomeServe
Your prompt action even on a SundayYour plumber was polite and knowledgeable And explained everything to usOverall we couldn't of asked for anything better,HomeServe
"The. Report was of my leaking tap was very quickly rectified, and the gentleman who repaired it very efficient, and went above and beyond doing the repair. Thank you",HomeServe
Excellent service and fitted us in despite being the middle of the holiday period. Drains unblocked and sinks working better than for years! Friendly and helpful plumber.,HomeServe
"Hello,The chap who came to look at our drains was on timevery pleasant, talked me through the procedure,showed me the images and left us very reassured.Thank you!",HomeServe
Phoned straightaway as soon a I noticed a leak to my drainage got a date for the repair straight away. On the day thinking it was going to be awhile for the repair to be fixed because of place it was. The guy had the repair done in no time and with no mess. I was fully satisfied with the outcome.,HomeServe
Absolutely first class service I had a problem with a leak under basin in downstairs toilet  phoned up and a plumber came out half an hour later. He said to get a new tap so he could replace it and said to phone back when I had it which I did and he was back within the hour to do the job !!!! It couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been better,HomeServe
1.  instant reaction to my phone call requesting help. 2.  appt fixed for next day3. engineer arrived within the timeframe given4.  he did not have the required part but travelled to  a plumbers merchants in Leamington Spa to get one. 5. returned and fitted the new part6 now working perfectly7 Thank you very much HomeSreve,HomeServe
Prompt reply from Helpline gave policy number and arranged appointment for following day. Kept in touch re arrival. Plumber arrived and dealt with leak and explained the problem -reassuring wont happen again,HomeServe
Booked appointment online via app and very easy and smart to use. Plumber arrived in a timely manner and was polite and professional. Highly recommended.,HomeServe
"The time taken to complete the work was to long, when the new part arrived it seems to be wrong part as the flush button now is far to recessed in the cistern.After contacting them another plumber was sent who fixed the problem as it seems the first guy didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fit correctly so all sorted. Pleased with their after service Ã°Å¸â€˜Â",HomeServe
The response was reliable and quick both for phone calls and attendance. The plumber carefully carried out his work and left everywhere he was doing so tidy and clean.,HomeServe
"All went really well. Booked an appointment for a leaking kitchen sink tap on the Friday and HomeServe plumber arrived Monday morning.The tap wasn't repairable, so the plumber took a new one from his van (almost identical to the one we had) and fitted it. For the Ã‚Â£30 ""excess"" charge, we had a new kitchen tap and the labour. The tap alone would have been a lot more than that!",HomeServe
Speed of call out phoned early evening and the following morning engineer arrived and fixed the problem which turned out to be a faulty washer from previous repair,HomeServe
The response time was good and the man that came was also very good.However the shocker was as it is not always clear that for each different item that needs attention on the call out there is a Ã‚Â£30 excess charge. So for example the main washer on toilet 1 flush system is the call out(via the insurance) plus Ã‚Â£30. Toilet No 2 same issue cost of Washer Ã‚Â£3.99 total replacement time 10 minutes Your cost another Ã‚Â£30 total 60 plus the insurance local plumber Ã‚Â£25should I continue with you?,HomeServe
The service was very excellent the plumber was on time and very helpful.,HomeServe
Water coming through lounge ceiling over Christmas!! Thank goodness for homeserve. Sorted the next day. Thank you,HomeServe
"The engineer was helpful, he repaired the leak which was in an awkward place.",HomeServe
"The number of blockages which had built up over the years in our drainage system was astounding, however the HomeServe member was determined to completely clear the pipes and did so on a cold and wet New Years Eve, spending over 5 hours doing the job - amazing!",HomeServe
It was very easy to book an appointment to get someone to look at our blocked drain and when the operator came around he was courteous and did a very thorough job in clearing the blockage. My only gripe is that this is meant to be an emergency service - however there was a 4 day delay from my initial contact to when the operator was able to come around.,HomeServe
"What a time to discover my toilet had a severe leak overnight at New Year. Just when I was expecting guests to stay. Thankfully, I had Homewise drainage and plumbing insurance. They arranged for a plumber to attend that very day within a few hours. He was my hero!  All fixed before guests arrival.",HomeServe
"The service that is included in my drain and plumbing policy (365/24/7 coverage for drains) was not provided.  During Storm Gerrit, and despite a very real threat of flooding, I was told by Homeserve i'd need to wait 4 days (then reduced to 3 days) for a technician to attend a blocked drain in fron of my garage whilst the storm raged.  Despite acknowledging the very real risk of flooding of my property, Homeserve would not improve on the 3 day delay.I was subsequently forced to engage an independent technician that day as it had started to rain again, heavily, and my property was about to flood.This cost me Ã‚Â£288, and at the time of writing this, I have yet to have a reply on any reimbursement from Homeserve (6 days later) but they have found the time to see how they performed on a customer survey !!!The summary is that Homeserve have badly let me down in this instance and their customer relations follow-ups seem to be completely out of touch with what they should be doing - ie dealing with an extremely unhappy, and out of pocket, customer.Do not use these guys.",HomeServe
"really helpful plumber, he rang me on route and turned up as he said he would, got the job done quickly and cleanly.",HomeServe
"Absolutely dreadful. Promised to come on Tuesday-didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Promised 8 am - first appointment- on Thursday, 11th.  It is now 4pm.   Problem is a blocked outside drain which canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t properly be fixed in the dark. Paid nearly Ã‚Â£350 for a years cover.DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ever use them.  They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care.",HomeServe
"The second plumber Paul who came was so good , took time and caring found the fault so efficient",HomeServe
A plumber came out on New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eve and fixed a broken tap quickly. He made sure I was happy with the work before he left. Excellent service.,HomeServe
Operative worked tirelessly to try and clear the blocked drains that were connected to the system.  Very polite and focussed on fixing the problem and keeping 3 families in the loop as to what was happening.  In the end it was down to anglia water to clear the blockages.  Homeserve was excellent and I would continue to pay for their services.,HomeServe
"The work was done well, but I had to wait four days for the appointment to fix the toilet. For the very high cost of the cover I would expect a same day fix!",HomeServe
The engineer was excellent. Managed to repair my tap no problem. So much better than the previous engineer who originally fitted the tap!,HomeServe
"I reported a broken and leaking toilet a week or so before Christmas, on top of my Ã‚Â£70 per month I also had the privilege of paying a Ã‚Â£60 excess charge. The plumber arrived and said he needed to order parts, four weeks later still not fixed. I received a call a week ago stating the parts would be with them in a day so, the parts are readily available at any builders / plumbers merchants. I could have replaced the entire cistern for my monthly fee and excess. This is not the first time, our boiler broke when the engineer turned up guess what ? parts again, a week later with no heating, middle of winter baby in the house I contacted Homeserve again who had no knowledge of the parts that were needed, but offered to send another engineer. I paid for a local gas fitter who fixed the boiler the same day, Homeserve did reimburse me on this occasion. They use third party companies not Homeserve employees, nearly Ã‚Â£800 per year plus a Ã‚Â£60 excess I will be cancelling my policy. I could virtually replace my boiler every year for what they charge for a very poor service. I had a web chat with Homeserve today and asked them to refund my excess I was simply met with Ã¢â‚¬Å“weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been out nowÃ¢â‚¬Â",HomeServe
"Appreciate speaking to somebody to explain problem and book call rather than automated service. Plumber was friendly efficient and thorough, ensuring l was completely satisfied with repair before leaving.",HomeServe
Easy booking for engineer. Prompt appointment.Engineer rang before arrival.Plumber selected was experienced and did a good job.,HomeServe
"The person who took my phone call was very helpful & told me that the engineer from HomeServe would be out to sort out my Drain Blockage later that same day. The Engineer was very Polite & Understanding, he cleared the Blockage in a very proficient way, he was Excellent",HomeServe
"I have Homeserve plumbing and always been very satisfied, friendly, efficient staff. Now I have signed for electrics so my who house is essentially covered",HomeServe
"Got through straight away on the phone, to a human being. Got call back during stated period. Plumber polite, quick and efficient.All sorted same day.",HomeServe
"Jose the plumber (plombier) was prompt, clean and efficient. The new tap is working well and I enjoyed some chat en espagnol before he left.Gracias!Cristobal",HomeServe
"Just needed drain and fresh water cover. Strangely enough house insurance does cover boilers and central heating breakdown, but not drainage problems. Touch wood, we never had a problem, but you never know, very reasonable policy & price for peace of mind. Very easy to complete online and done it in less than 5 mins. Great service.",HomeServe
The HomeServe claims front line works efficiently and their quality experienced engineers are available in short time especially if an emergency.   Their actual insurance plan is still work in progress.   Experienced engineer attends quickly locates issue which inevitable falls outside their nit picking policy conditions leaving the punter to finish off the job and try and locate alternative plumber to deal with their policy shortfall.   eg Only want to use a generic replacement to fix an issue or you buy your own like-for-like.    Could be a great product let down by nit picking small print not bold enough in the policy conditions.   That said they use good mature time served engineers who also expressed unpleasant client confrontations and being middle men to sorting out the policy issues and leaving clients abandoned.,HomeServe
"I signed up for homeserve plumbing insurance on line,  it was quick and straightforward. No need to fill out any paperwork and find a postbox for an envelope. Quick and easy.",HomeServe
The first visit to repair the leak from our kitchen sink was a disaster and my wife sent a review regarding this. It meant that the aftermath of our Christmas lunch was very soggy!!The man that visited us on 27th was very thorough and replaced a major piece of sink plumbing.This time it seemed to have worked.,HomeServe
"The site was very easy to negotiate and signing up only took a few minutes. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good to have the peace of mind to know that should a plumbing or drainage emergency occur, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have help on hand.",HomeServe
Got an offer for this for Ã‚Â£60 for 12 months on plumbing and drainage cover.  They wanted over Ã‚Â£250 for renewal. No negotiation on redoing it for a another Ã‚Â£60.  They even sent me an SES offer which I could not claim on.  Called them up and said I would have to wait 4 years to get it at Ã‚Â£60.  What a load of rubbish.,HomeServe
the plummer arrived and did a very efficient job unblocking my sink and drain pipes,HomeServe
"Once again, HomeServe let me down. I have a plumbing/drains plan. One of my two toilets was not flushing properly, so I called in HomeServe. The plumber said the toilet was 'knackered' and I needed a new toilet. He couldn't do the work on behalf of HomeServe because I have another toilet, so it wasn't an emergency. I just had a visit from a local plumber who said there is a blockage in the drain pipe and he will come back on Monday to clear it out.  I do not need a replacement toilet! However, I will be paying a plumber for work that should have been done under my HomeServe plan. I had a very similar experience a few months ago.",HomeServe
"Simple, quick and a great plumbing package.",HomeServe
"I was forced to call on Homeserve the day before Christmas Eve as I found a leaking downpipe and was going away for a few days on Boxing Day. Being recently widowed I had got myself in a bit of a state - the call centre were brilliant and got a plumber out to me that afternoon, I was so, so grateful. Brilliant, responsive, empathetic service - thank you!",HomeServe
"Lack of communication. Left a vulnerable, elderly woman with no water from December 25 to 31st.  One  Homeserve engineer attended on 27th December and diagnosed an external leak. 2nd  attended on the 31st and correctly identified as an internal leak which took 15 minutes to repair.",HomeServe
I  have been extremally impressed  and pleased by the service provided by HomeServe UK in solving problem related to working of the toilet. It did not take that long to get the appointments for engineer to come. The staff dealing with the complaint had lot of patience to listen to the problem.,HomeServe
"We have had ongoing problems with a blocked toilet pipe and many visits from Homeserve engineers over the years to clear it. Daniel is the first one who refused to quit until he had found and fixed the cause of our problem. He visited us three times, investigated the pipes and drains thoroughly, and brought colleagues who had the right equipment to help. After some excavation and replacing a section  of the pipe our drains are running smoothly. We are very grateful for the determination and commitment Daniel displayed and would highly recommend him. Thanks HomeServe!",HomeServe
"Twice in last year we have called them out to leaks. First to a leak under the floor in our toilet, second to a dripping tap. To say both times its been a saga! BE AWARE that they fix the problem, but don't make good the hole in both cases thy made to access to the problem!! So now we have a floor with a hole in and a bedroom wall with a hole in, as they had to go through the wall for access to a dripping tap!! We rent our house, and I am sure for our tenants it's a nightmare!! we made a complaint,  and all she kept saying was read the T and C!! Never in all our years have we had to make good access for an insurance  claim! I didn't even want to give 1 star, we will be moving our insurance for sure!!",HomeServe
Plumbing insurance that covers pipes to the property easy to set up. Website clear and easy to use. Good value for 1st year.,HomeServe
The service we received for a blocked drain was good - arrived on time and also rang to let us know when he would arrive.  Quickly checked sink drains inside - then checked outside drain and found the problem with drain pipe - cleared drain - explained what the problem was and there have been no further blockages.  Excellent service.  Thank you.,HomeServe
Excellent telephone response when reporting the problem.Quick response to identify the leaking pipe. 8 day wait for repair but leak occurred just before Christmas.Flexible approach to repair and completed within a few hours.,HomeServe
We had four visits from different Engineers to fit new tapes. After the third visit we had flooded bathroom and kitchen boards and kitchen tops damaging few things. The last engineer found loose connection causing the problem,HomeServe
Both Bath tub and Basin taps leaking but only Bath got fixed as only one ticket was raised.,HomeServe
Had a leaky bath pipe on New Year's Day an emergency plumber called and came out within an hour and sorted the problem fantastic service,HomeServe
He.did what was necessary. He had a problem with a big dog which was not very friendly. The drain was clear when he arrived.,HomeServe
"Leak was located to a seal on the u bend under kitchen sink. Nothing was replaced, just taped up. I think this is unacceptable for a Ã‚Â£30 excess. Also did not check any further leaks even thought I had water under the kitchen cupboards so could have also been further down the pipe. If I known it was just that I would have fixed it myself rather than pay the Ã‚Â£30",HomeServe
"After a blind panic 2 days before Christmas, I called out a local emergency plumber who completely ruined our toilet, flooded downstairs and left our toilet worse than when they came, I remembered I had Homeserve insurance!! Absolute lifesavers!! Firstly Russell came and worked SO hard to fix the blockage, but it wouldn't clear, then Aaron came with the camera equipment and between them both, they cleared and fixed the problem. Fantastic service!! Would highly recommend Homeserve. 100%",HomeServe

I had blocked drains and for 5 hours had to continually sweep water away to stop my kitchen flooding. I was given a next day appointment with a promise of an engineer ringing before 10am. I did not receive a call and had to ring again to restart the procedure. You were quick to take the excess from my bank account but slow in resolving the problem,HomeServe
"At the beginning of New Year, my husband, who is disabled, called you to say we had a problem with our toilet. The lady who spoke to my husband was very understanding, concerned and extremely helpful about our situation. In response to our call, an engineer was sent out to us in super quick time to assess the problem and as a result we had a new toilet fitted. We cannot praise the engineer enough, he was very helpful, kind, considerate and very hardworking. His work ethic was second to none as he was extremely efficient and left everywhere nice and clean and tidy.  We do not know where we would be or what we would do without your service. Thank you!",HomeServe

"Great service from the Homeserve team. It was initially a bit strange talking to AI to book my service, but you get used to it. The drainage guy was very prompt and diagnosed the fault with 15mins, called for a plumber as the problem was internal. Plumber came an hour later and soon solved the problem. CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been better really. Well happy.",HomeServe

Work was undertaken on time as agreed. The plumber was polite and friendly. He explained what he was doing and why. He fixed the problem.,HomeServe
"After calling Homeserve when the plumber had not turned up at the times arranged, they went out of their way to chase him up and called back to say that he was running late and would arrive shortly.  The plumber then turned up and was most apologetic.  He cleared the blocked sink drain in no time, and then went on to replace a leaky tap at no extra charge.  He was very pleasant and couldn't have been more helpful.",HomeServe
easy to contact prompt action polite plumber good job done.,HomeServe
"Most of what I need are either not covered or the team canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t/not willing to fix it.One engineer was really helpful and helped me to book for a plumber to come, but in the end the plumber still couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t result the problem (just investigate). I ended up having to get a local plumber to sort this out for me.Just a waste of money with homeserve",HomeServe

"Problem with leaking overflow on outside wall. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry to say that I was passed from pillar to post.   Having spoken to a total of 10/12 people over two weeks on very long calls, I was told by some that I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have cover and others that I did have cover.  Even when I knew and said I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered I was still told I was.  This has been a shambles and a worry as I (Janet Moss, nearly 80, BarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife) have had a stroke and cancer and Barry, 82, has cancer, heart failure and dementia. I would appreciate your comments please.",HomeServe

"An excellent service provided by Homeserve.My call was answered within about 20 seconds & you could book an appointment by voice activation, very simply with only 2 or 3 options. They booked us an appointment straight away.Homeserve arranged for their plumbing contractor to contact us, which was within the hour,& they offered to come out the same day to resolve our plumbing issue. We accepted the next day appointment instead.A very personal & professional, knowledgeable plumber turned up & sorted out our issue expertly.Grateful Homeserve customers! Recommend.",HomeServe
Reported a claim twice online and heard nothing. called after two days to be told the system sometimes gets stuck when you book a claim online so the claim was hanginh on their system unassigned. Had I not called nothing would have happened. Booked a plumber on Wednesday for Friday . waited in all-day Friday and had to chase twice by phone.. someone finally came at 7:30 .. and reported the job as an emergency for a call out on Monday . Asked what slot I wanted and was told I had 8-1.. of course at NINE minutes to one I get a call saying time slot has been changed to 12-6. Another call at 5.52 from a drainage expert to advise that nobody will be coming today at all . three let downs . two no shows within less than two days.. Two failed appointments in one day. unbelievable! Shambolic poor customer service. offered an appointment when I was working having taken two days off for failed visits. Now told I have to wait until Saturday. Cannot believe the level of incompetence and poor service from Homeserve.. truly shocking. In the meantime we have an awful sewage smell in my home.. so much for them classing this as an emergency call TERRIBLE SERVICE.,HomeServe
"There was a blockage of some kind on my property, affecting a bathroom & a cloakroom. Called Homeserve & they got an indoor plumber round within 24hrs on Xmas Eve. He said it was a drainage issue & it was rebooked with a different plumber who had rods etc. This person came after Xmas & said the job needed both indoor and outdoor plumbers. The job was rebooked again & at New Year 2 plumbers arrived. But the drain camera they had didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work. Homeserve HQ wanted a 4th rebook on the job & I just put my foot down & said no. Instead a 3rd plumber was sent ( a 40 minute wait) & the 3 of them sorted the problem in about 25 minutes with jet washers etc. They were great , but honestly, I think the 2nd visit should have solved it- The thing with Homeserve is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only as good as the plumbers they send you. What you are paying for is that they do send them pretty quickly and at some point they have to solve the problem. I rather resent paying an excess though.",HomeServe
"Called on Saturday 13th Jan due to a blocked sewer pipe. Was originally given an appointment for Tuesday the 16th but managed to call back and have this moved to Monday 15th PM.The engineer came late on Monday afternoon and couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do the job because his jetting machine broke. The engineer led me to believe that a contractor would attend within 4 hours to carry out the job. After I couple of hours I received all call from Homeserve who told be that they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even contact the contractor until the tomorrow.This is now 2.5 without being able to use my bath, shower, sinks, toilet or washing machine and I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use the garden because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contaminated with sewage. With a family of 5 in the house, including 2 kids and a dog, this is an absolute joke. I booked a day off work to be here for the engineer, which is now completely wasted. After the eventÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s described above, I since booked the following day off in order clean up the contamination; this is likely a waste as well because it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound like thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s any guarantee that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get an appointment tomorrow.",HomeServe
The technician was polite and efficient..quickly resolving my leaking toilet,HomeServe
"Had a few leaks under my kitchen sink which was linked to the washing machine I tried to sort it myself but no luck. Called out homeserve and booked appointment for the next day. Engineer came out checked and sorted it all out within 15 minutes.

It does what it says on the tin.",HomeServe

Engineer arrived at the time expected and carried out the repair to my tap quickly.,HomeServe
"I had 2 people from Homeserve.  One for the inside and one to replace the tap and flush system of the loo.  All that was good (cheapest of taps tho and probably the cheapest of flush systems) but the person from polygon who searched for leaks under the floor was convinced it was the cold water tank.  He fiddled with the valve and it failed after his visit.  We ran out of water but it could have gone the other way and continued to fill. I wonder if this person was trying to create something in order to be seen to find a remedy.   I bought a new filter for Ã‚Â£16 and a Ã‚Â£150 visit from my normal plumber to replace it.  I did not want another incompetent plumber or one with an agenda.  I have raised a complaint with Homeserve but heard nothing.     I am now after Ã‚Â£166 and Ã‚Â£30 = Ã‚Â£196 for homeserve mistakes and costs, back to square one wondering why I have such a massive water bill and what is leaking in my house.",HomeServe

We waited in all day for a plummer to fix leak in pipe 5pm BOILER ENGINEER turned up so had to re book for next day job was done quickly and well in the end,HomeServe
"The problem has not been fixed. I had a leaking tap, the engineer changed the head but couldn't fit the tap. The head does not fit the tap at all.  the only thing he recommended was to change the entire faucet.",HomeServe
I was charged Ã‚Â£30 excess fee simply just to UNPLUMB the pipe - a 2-minute job with his hoover. I had reported the bathroom sink as not just blocked BUT also leaking at the base of the U-bend pipe. As soon as the plumber realised that the plug column (the press down variety) wouldn't budge he refused to deal with it saying it was a second job and that I would have to log as such and pay a further Ã‚Â£30 excess. That won't happen again as I will be cancelling this Homeserve policy.,HomeServe
While the service was prompt and professional. I felt somewhat let down. You came to replace my electric shower but it transpired that the water inlet was on the opposite side to the one you supplied (not sure why this was not observed/ noted on the first site visit). When the plumber came to fit the shower this was raised as an issue and I was informed by your office that while you would support me in  buying a new shower you would not fit it. I felt that you had left me 'high and dry' to buy another shower and also find a plumber to fit it. Your own plumber seemed a bit bemused by this. While the new shower was not the same model as the one you provided it was the same make. In fact it was a like for like replacement meaning all the fittings are identical making it easier to fit. It seems that something so basic (water inlet on opposite side) has become a major issue in fitting a shower. Should you not consider fitting showers in circumstances (even if for an additional nominal charge - which I would not be averse to paying)? If you only supply shower units with set water inlets this limits everything!,HomeServe
I called out Homeserve for a dripping tap. Initially the repair was not carried out correctly and it failed within 24 hours.  However as soon as I reported the concern Homerse quickly corrected the repair to my complete satisfaction. Overall the experience was very good.,HomeServe
Knowledgeable and speedy response by the assigned plumber,HomeServe
I have been a Homeserve customer (part of the Drainage and Plumbing PlusScheme) for many years.  I haven't contacted them for a few years.  I rang up today as my loo is blocked.  I have tried to sort it out myself as didn't want to pay the call out premium on top of the monthly direct debit I pay but I can't sort it myself.  I got through to a 'robot' - not impressed with that but thought perhaps Homeserve were ploughing money into extra field staff instead.  The robot told me that the first available appointment is not until next week.  Not much point people paying into this scheme if there aren't any workers readily available to sort out problems when they arise.  Not impressed with having to deal with a robot - too much technology and not enough action!,HomeServe
"We had a water leak from our shower and that shorted out our electrics. After telling them repeatedly that we had elderly 81 and 54 yr old who was disabled in the property and that we couldnt wait days for a repair person. We managed to get a visit! The guy was good and soon got our heating back on and said someone would arrange a date to sort the repair. Days passed and no call so we chased and told on the phone we dont cover that! Annoyed that they hadnt rung and told us that we looked elsewhere only a week later they rang to so they would do it and sent a guy to measure up. Again we were told to await a call for repair date. No call came after several days so again we chased only to be told they wouldnt do it now. The annoying thing is the lack of customer service in saying you will call/do something and then not do anything. We now have to ring the plumber we had sourced and had to tell no to due to homeserve saying they would repair it, and see if hes still willing to repair it. This is just not the way to treat people",HomeServe
"Had a broken drain pipe abd after calling homeserve it was dealt with quickly, call out was next day and it gave me the confidence to use homeserve again",HomeServe
"Arrived within just a few hours of calling. The plumber who came was professional, friendly and resolved the blockage and cleaned up well afterwards.",HomeServe

Quick efficient diagnosis of problem and leak quickly fixed,HomeServe
Home serve promptly attended a burst pipe in our kitchen on Christmas day night.A brilliant service.,HomeServe
Plumbers on 3 seperate occasions fobbed us off claiming leak was from roof when it was a faulty valve on pipework from boilermate. Then said valve not covered under policy only pipes to and from the valve.,HomeServe
Very polite and efficient and cleaned up after the repair - no complaints. Came back the following day to rectify a small issue with the siphon.,HomeServe
My shower was leaking.  I clearly emphasised it was the shower. When the engineer arrived he immediately refused to even look at it saying it's not covered under the policy I have. I have been refused a refund for his visit and consider it very unfair,HomeServe
"He unblocked my sink which was good he was very polite and he covered his shoes so not to get my carpet dirty which was very good as well, overall I was very happy with the service.",HomeServe
"Good response when phoning to say it was an emergency, next day appointment.  Drain engineer was very polite, helpful and effici",HomeServe
The Homeserve sight was easy to understand on what was covered and what was not. I love the Ã‚Â£1 a month per month for 12 months trial and can cancel anytime if you wish. It also gave us peace of mind that the pipes outside the house are all covered.,HomeServe
Making contact seemed easy albeit speaking to a robot! Telephoned in the morning and a plumber attended the same day which was great.  However disappointed that the plumber who came did not have the right tools to fix the problem so had to have a return visit the next day but all in all the job was fixed efficiently.,HomeServe
"The Plumber arrived as stipulated, and proceeded to rectify the problem without delay or fuss.",HomeServe

The engineer who came out to help with our leaking overflow was prompt and courteous. He arrived within a few hours of making the phone call which was excellent.,HomeServe
"The chatbot system failed to identify the word BIDET. It didn't therefore ask if there was also a blockage with the toilet in the same bathroom. Had it asked this question and I had stated that there wasn't and explained the toilet was flushing without issue, it should have picked up that it wasn't a drainage issue but in fact a plumbing issue. A drainage expert was sent unnecessarily. The call out and claim could have been avoided",HomeServe
Your guys did an excellent job finding the leak in our front garden and repairing it too. This took 2 days.,HomeServe
The plumber was excellent in that the whole job was undertaken in a very straightforward and pleasant manner. He came did the job and went. What else could you want.,HomeServe
I'm still waiting 12 days later for my report from the engineer on the leak at my home. After many many phone calls promises and emails still nothing.Meanwhile water is still dripping from my ceiling and I can't get it fixed until I have this report!!! How difficult is it to send!!@,HomeServe
Very friendly helpful plumber who phoned me giving me an eta. Happy to google the error code and act on it.,HomeServe
fast and cheap service which took care of our drain issue the chap who turned up cleared the drain but seemed to be in a rush and told us that the water board could've cleared it and it was the responsibility of the water board but wasn't too sure so will have to chase this up if it happens again,HomeServe
Excellent job clearing drain Logistics a shambles,HomeServe

"Call out was arranged quickly which was nice.  Rep didnt remove his shoes, Smelt of smoke, And i still have the slow drain problem.

The help I received from Homeserve was excellent. The timing of the leak could have been better but they came out as soon as they could and fixed the problem. When another issue came up with the same fault they came straight back out. Fully explained everything and couldn't have made the stressful situation easier. Cannot recommend them enough!,HomeServe
The engineer very personable and checked thoroughly for the blockage which had cleared itself. Also gave useful info and advice on how to prevent and clear blockages.,HomeServe
The plumber informed me he was on his way and was able to fix my broken tap by replacing the whole thing which I am very pleased with.,HomeServe

I cannot understand why everyone doesn't have them especially if like me, Plumbing is seen as a foreign language.",HomeServe
"Booked someone to see what was going on with water under my house as it stank. I specifically told them this and asked if they could test if it was foul water or not. I also made sure they were aware that it was not coming from my property. They sent me a plumber who could do nothing. Luckily, we spoke on the phone before he drove 1.5hours to get to me. He managed to help and we got someone from the waste management team to come. Who questioned why he was even there as they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t test the water or pump the water out and could only look at the drains which are lower than y house and I already knew they were clear. We were told to ring Yorkshire water as they do the testing on the water and they could find the location of where it was coming from. I had to pay my excess to cover the guys coming out when what should have happened was, I should have been referred to Yorkshire water on the phone as homeserve couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do anything. I waited in all day and lost money from not working and got the privilege of been charged for it! Jokers",HomeServe

It took a while to resolve the problem....up to 4 visits. They ordered the part from their own supplier but when it arrived it didn't fit within the cistern. All the plumbers were lovely and they done their best to solve the issue which we were very grateful. Happy with the outcome.,HomeServe
"Prompt response, original plumbing problem resolved, but repair left me with another problem due to altered pipework which affected the space where my washing machine was sited - and cannot be re-positioned.  I advised Homeserve of this - to be told I have to deal with this myself - not Homeserve's responsibility. I  am not sure of the date the job was done - just previous to Christmas in late December.",HomeServe
"On contacting the operator she initially indicated we would have to wait a number of days before they could send someone out, which was disappointing. However, eventually she stated she could have someone out that same day. The worker contacted us prior to the visit with an estimated time when he would arrive, this was great. On arrival he was efficient and helpful and resolved the blockage and cleaned up.",HomeServe
"Fantastic service. Good flexibility on arranging appt and showed on the day between the time given.  Also contacted me on the day from plumbing engineer that he was arriving within the hour.  On arrival professional attire and manner.  Thoroughly fixed the pipe outside and give me details on how to protect re preventing freezing and bursting.  Also give further advice re cockstop & when to call them to arranged as needs setting up properly as currently the only way to stop water is from under drain covering in back lane therefore needs changing. Really happy with Homeserve, totally stress free and makes a difference to be able to trust this type of service without any hidden extra costs.",HomeServe
"HomeServe plumber was friendly and respectful of my home, found the fault in no time and made sure the problem wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t arise again.",HomeServe
Called HomeServe to identify where leak was coming from around water tank. Engineer said it was pump and isolated that. Soon after he left it started leaking again. Had to call another plumber who identifies that it was coming from water tank not the pump.,HomeServe

"This review is on behalf of my Mum who has had a very poor experience with Homeserve. An outside water pipe has burst and so she contacted homeserve who advised that an engineer would not be able to come for 96 hours! Despite the freezing outside temperatures, being in her 70s and living alone she now has to be without water or heating over the weekend, unless she can source a plumber herself. Homeserve also had the audacity to charge her Ã‚Â£30 excess before they would even put things in motion. Thankfully she has now found an emergency plumber who lives locally who is  prepared to come out at short notice. However, despite regular payments to Homeserve for a number of years she will now have to fund this herself.",HomeServe
"Initial visit for problem excellent. A part needed ordering and took 5/6days to arrive,it was over new year period so bank holiday didn't help.Part ordered was the wrong one,too big.Different Plumber fitted a different make and  model  and was told it was universal.Drip solved but as fitting too small for my unit I often need to flush twice.",HomeServe
Excellent service with cheerful and helpful plumber,HomeServe
"I called Homeserve out because of a leak from the bath . It turned out the was a leak from the plug hole and the taps . The plumber told me he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do both as they were 2 separate jobs, even though I paid for the taps and the cost of the seal for the bath is just a few pence !I was told I have to make a separate claim which will take more time and inconvenience.. and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to pay another Ã‚Â£30 to fit a part that takes a couple of minutes and costs almost nothing. This is first time IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve used Homeserve and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not impressed. I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Very poor customer service ! IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll up paying double it would have cost to call out a local plumber - and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on top of the monthly cover .The reply from Homeserve doesn't address the fact they don't tell you they won't repair two problems even if they are on the same device, so you have to pay for TWO Call Outs.",HomeServe
Very pleasant guy who phoned to say he was en route. The problem with the cistern is intermittent and not showing itself while he was there so he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help apart from giving advice.     Would prefer to speak to a person not a robot when I ring the claims line!,HomeServe
HomeServe provided a prompt and efficient service in checking there were no blockages in the pipes to my washing machine. I was satisfied with the outcome.,HomeServe
"This appointment to repair a leaking tap was no different to the few others I have experienced over the years. Communication was excellent on the day, kept up to date as to where the plumber was etc. He was very polite and arrived within the given window. He ended up changing the tap as the leaking one was over 20 years old and had had its day. All done within an hour. We were very satisfied.",HomeServe
"The first plumber sorted the problem but there was a leak, which need another visit that addressed the issue.Both appointments arrived in a timely manner and the plumbers were polite, courteous and professional.",HomeServe
Once we got the correct plumbing operative it was great as our problem was resolved within 30 minutes.The contact system made a mess of our problem and sent out a drainage operative first instead of a plumber to sort out a ball cock problem.,HomeServe
Knowing that I was being dealt with in an efficent and looked after way.  Thanks for sorting out my dripping tap and supplying me with a really nice replacement.,HomeServe
Very quick to respond. Very important when you have a leek . Clean and tidy,HomeServe
The toilet overflow would not stop the running water. The person attended to fix the problem but could not get into the system without breaking the side panel and split the wall panel.This he did so by fixing one problem now created another problem. The panel is in a poor state and was left in this state.Very disappointing service.,HomeServe
"Application is easy and smooth with everything clear to understand. Price for the first year is just Ã‚Â£1 per month which is very competitive and worth to use, just Ã‚Â£1 with excess payment of Ã‚Â£30 for each claim, to have intensive cover of your homeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pipes and drainage is a fair deal",HomeServe
"Soon after Christmas, I had a water leak. I called up and was immediately offered an appointment the next day. The Plumber turned up the next day and was very professional. He needed to get access and had to remove part of one tile. This was done so carefully that it is difficult to see the damaged tile unless one looks specifically for it. Well done, Homeserve and Plumber.",HomeServe
"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m usually quite skeptical about insurance companies that offer boiler cover. I found them because i was having a plumbing problem that was quite expensive to fix and they were running a promotion on their drains cover - so I decided to give them a try. A few months later we did end up having slow drains throughout the house. I booked an appointment using their online system (earliest appointment was almost a week in the future, but it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an emergency so I was fine with that). The plumber showed up as announced but he immediately said that I need a drains engineer and I should call up homeserve to book that. They were then able to send over a drains engineer in the very same day. He then diagnosed the issue to be somewhere between my house and 5 houses away and advised to contact Thames Water. Thames Water then came two days later and sorted it out. Very happy!Only improvement I would suggest is their online booking system. If that had allowed me to describe my problem in more detail they could have sent me the drains engineer straight away. Their phone system is quite impressive: it recognises you by your number and the agent immediately addresses you by your name.",HomeServe
Quick response to a leak from the upstairs toilet. Plumber spotted the problem straight away and fixed it,HomeServe
"When the plumber arrived at approximately 00.20 a.m. on one of the coldest nights of the year I had been expecting a grumpy man but NO!!!! He was polite, clean, even had overshoes to protect my floors.  He sorted the problem quickly, fitted a new mixer tap and then was off to his next job.When I went out to the kitchen to clear up it was spotless and nothing for me to do but replace everything back into the cupboards.He was so polite and pleasant despite the late hour.I did ring the office on the Monday to pass on these comments and do hope he was told just how pleased I was.",HomeServe
"As previously, have always found the Homeserve plumbers great. Ã‚Â£30 excess charge is very reasonable when my renewal only cost Ã‚Â£6 for a whole year. I wouldn't pay the standard annual charge if I could help it, though. Note to others : wait a bit when it comes up for renewal and you may get a much better super duper offer.",HomeServe
"Before choosing HomeServe, I thoroughly researched and compared it with other companies and their services. In the end, I opted for HomeServe based on positive feedback. Unfortunately, I encountered issues, primarily with the individual engineer who handled the jobs. See below for more details.For the first fault reported in October 2023:In October 2023, we encountered the first reported issue, involving a leak from the waste pipe leading to the upstairs toilet seat and a problem with the flush parts inside the same toilet seat. These concerns were conveyed through the live chat, and a representative promptly scheduled an appointment for both tasks. Upon reconfirmation with the representative, she sought clarification on whether both issues were in the same location/toilet. My response was affirmative, leading her to assert that only one appointment was necessary, and she duly noted the details of both problems.On the day the engineer arrived, I explained and showed him both issues. However, he contested that only one job had been reported and declined to address the second issue, insisting that each job needed separate scheduling. His behaviour was confrontational, and he asserted that a new appointment for the second task would be necessary, adding to our disappointment. The miscommunication among the system, representative, and engineer became apparent. We endured an additional week-long wait for the engineer to return and fix the waste pipe. He offered to change the flush parts as a gesture but cautioned us to report each job separately in the future. However, our satisfaction was marred when he accidentally damaged the vinyl flooring near the toilet seat while explaining that he could not see silicone around the seat which caused the tear. He apologised for this and at that time we couldn't do anything and let him go since he sorted out both reported issues but rectifying this error incurred an unexpected cost as we now had to replace the entire toilet flooring. Another issue was reported in December 2023:In December 2023, a new issue emerged as water began dripping from the cold water pipe in the kitchen downstairs. The same engineer from the previous visit responded to this job. Upon showing him the leaks, he went out to get his tools. During this interval, I observed water dripping from another side of the same cold water pipe, and upon his return, his demeanour changed negatively. He berated me for not mentioning the additional leak while he was retrieving his tools, asserting his capacity to handle only one repair at a time. Despite his initial abrasive attitude, he eventually fixed both issues before leaving. However, the unpleasant encounter was exacerbated by his loud and confrontational behaviour, which left me feeling insulted, especially with my family and a 2-year-old daughter present at home.The following day revealed a new problem: water was dripping rapidly from the newly installed T-shaped valve under the kitchen sink. Placing a bowl to mitigate the damage, I discovered that the small 10mm water pipe going to our Virgin Pure water machine was not securely locked in place. Attempting to rectify this, the pipe dislodged, causing a flood in the kitchen. It took considerable effort to halt the flooding by turning off the main supply, inconveniently the main supply is located behind the toilet seat in the WC. Upon checking, it was evident that the pipe and valve replacement were not properly secured. The resulting flood damaged the wood beneath the vinyl flooring, creating a significant bubble that persists to this day. For this issue, I could reach out to HomeServe but due to the emergency of having no water at all and a flooded kitchen, I went ahead and tightened and secured the small pipe properly.This unfortunate sequence of events has left me deeply disappointed, highlighting a lack of proper customer service training for the engineer in terms of communication and diligence. While I acknowledge the challenges of handling multiple jobs throughout the day, this behaviour does not align with the standards one would expect from a reputable company like HomeServe. As this incident occurred within my first year with HomeServe, the prospect of encountering similar issues or having the same engineer return prompts me to reconsider renewing my package. I sincerely hope for a different engineer in the future, and if the same individual is assigned again, I may choose not to renew my package when it becomes due. Despite these challenges, I have given a two-star rating, acknowledging the effectiveness of the online system in arranging repairs, while emphasising the need for improved training and professionalism among the engineers.",HomeServe
"I'm in hospital with a bad asthma attack. My wife rang me to say the outside tap had sprung a bad leak, outside and in the downstairs loo. This Friday 19th January 2024, very cold weather. Rang Homeserve to book a repair person. Initially they couldn't do it until Monday 21st. When I explained that I was being discharged either later today or tomorrow,  and that I am 76, my wife 74 and I would be vulnerable with no water and possibly heating. So the appointment was booked for this evening between 5.00 pm and 10.00pm, so I paid the Ã‚Â£30.00 excess. Rang my wife to tell her the ""good"" news. A few minutes later I received a text saying sorry can't do today, will come between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Monday. Can't come because we are dealing with emergencies. I thought we were  an emergency.I managed to get a local plumber, one of the old school who came straight out and isolated the tap from the rest of the system, so we now have the water back on. He charged Ã‚Â£25.00. So I'm waiting for Homeserve to come out and make a good job of the actual damage.",HomeServe
"Engineer arrived earlier than expected which was a surprise, with prior notice as promised. The issue ( drain fat ball ) was removed despite it being 16 metres from the inspection chamber in a quick & professional manner. All in all, an excellent service.",HomeServe
Absolutely brilliant service we were away and only our son was in they phoned us to check on if we wanted a certain tap before he started work.First class workmanship and very helpful engineer,HomeServe
"With Emergency Cover, I hoped In our Ã¢â‚¬Å“hour of needÃ¢â‚¬Â with a major leak from a radiator we would be able to utilise a cover we have had for a couple of years without using. After a 28 minute wait before being able to speak to someone, I have just been advised the EARLIEST attendance possible is next Friday (a week a way). I was also advised that I would need to pay a Ã‚Â£30.00 fee prior (my excess which IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m comfortable with) to have an escalation logged for a quicker engineer visit (that might not actually be possible). It really is shameful and embarrassing that this is considered perfectly acceptable for an Emergency Cover Plan. I do hope anyone reading this and contemplating Homeserve for cover seriously reconsiders and also reads all the other 1 Star reviews. 1 in 10 reviewers at the time of writing this, also view Homeserve equally as poor as myself. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve reached out to emergency plumbers locally and have one attending within 2 hours to help at considerable cost. Something I never thought I would need to do by having cover. Do think about this seriously before taking out a policy.",HomeServe
"Just joined again, have used & called them out in the past. Found homeserve excellent & solved the issueWith leaking taps in the kitchen.Hope, the service will be the same .Wauld recommend to friends & family.",HomeServe
"Leaking toilet cistern first repair man was useless, but the second younger repair man was professional, experienced, polite and a credit to the company",HomeServe
We had a leak from under the floor and was visited by Ahmad Jalout. Harry Hetherington assisted with sourcing the leak and they both worked tirelessly to rectify the issue. Their team work should be recognised and they are a shining example for their company.,HomeServe
"Easy and straight forward to complete my application for plumbing and draining protection, couldn't have been easier and at very reasonable price.",HomeServe
"My immersion tank is leaking, dripping into the cupboards and down the wall in my kitchen.  Homeserve sent a plumber who was very nice but apparently homeserve won't cover the immersion tank, so the plumber left . Meanwhile water continued leaking. I tried for over a week to get another plumber but could not get any to come out as they were all booked. Eventually called homeserve again because I'm now panicking about the damage being done. The plumber came out again and put some plumber putty around the leak until I can find another plumber to sort the problem. This barely lasted a day before Continuing to leak badly. I know homeserve said they won't replace the immersion but I'm not impressed being left with leaking water and no way to stop it.",HomeServe
Set up new policy to cover our home plumbing - simple process (and v cheap for the first year!),HomeServe
Very good offer of Ã‚Â£12 for first year's plumbing cover. Straight forward application process.,HomeServe
The plumber was excellent and did a fine job. Turned up on time and fixed the problem with no issues,HomeServe
"I was so glad I had the cover when told my water usage was extremely high and probably due to a leak.  Homeserve came out the following day to determine where the leak was and then sent someone out the day after that to dig up my front garden to investigate further, only to discover it was at the meter.  The lad did replace all the soil and turf he had dug up but it does now have a dip.  I would have thought they would have had some equipment to investigate without digging up the garden.  Not the fault of the young man who did come out.  He did what he could to limit the damage.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure what this will do to premiums!",HomeServe
"First appointment - no one turned up.  Was told after the time had passed that the engineer was on his way and would ring when near.  Nothing!  Appointment made for next day.  Engineer turned up in an Enterprise van with no jets.  Couldn't do the job!  Appointment made for the next day.  No one turned up.  Homeserve cancelled the appointment after the time for arrival had passed - no reason given.  Fourth appointment made for two days later, making it a full week that I would have been with overflowing toilets and a completely blocked drain!  I phoned a local drainage specialist who came and did the job first thing the next day.  I then cancelled the Homeserve appointment and have sent in a formal complaint, together with the bill for what I paid to the local contractor.  For Homeserve to call their service an 'emergency service' is beyond a joke!  When paying insurance to protect against things like this going wrong, it is completely unacceptable to think it is okay to sort out a serious problem a week after it was first reported!!!",HomeServe
"The booking etc for a toilet which kept blocking was fine and the plumber turned up on time. However, all he did was top up the water. He said there was too much of a build up of limescale and I just needed to buy a new toilet. There was no attempt to try and clear it",HomeServe
"Polite plumber, on time and efficient - new items fitted and double checked.",HomeServe
The plumber arrived on time with the correct part and fixed my cistern. Very polite and cleaned up after himself.,HomeServe
Easy to book appointment online for next day. Phoned to advise arrival time and carried out drain unblockage quickly,HomeServe
"Would have been 5 stars but it was a long wait (6 hours) before the plumber  arrived. It was a Sunday though so no complaint on that score. Work was done quickly and efficiently, thanks.",HomeServe
"The operative did not agree with us that there was a smell in the house. We had recently had a new drive laid so when he tried to get the inspection covers up, he couldn't.  We therefore had to recall our builders to resolve that and they sluiced the drains at the same time. We are awaiting a new inspection cover as the handle snapped on the new one and at that point was going to recall yourselves. I did try to ring a couple of times to explain this but was on hold do long I gave up. In effect, the job has never been completed.",HomeServe
Good service for plumbing emergency leak.,HomeServe
I was very pleased with the work. The plumber arrived late in the evening and found the leak underneath the bath. The pipe had become disconnected. He connected it which was not easy as it was awkward and difficult to reach.,HomeServe
Plumber  arrived on time  . He did a good job . Made no mess removed all broken parts .  He even had boot covers for his feet .,HomeServe
"Quite disappointed, paid my excess and told not much they can do about a basic bath blockage advised to go and buy more stuff myself!",HomeServe
"I was told to claim off HomeServe by Severn Trent who sponsor this insurance company. However, HomeServe informed me that they do not repair leaks off property, so the insurance is virtually useless for water supply pipes. Severn Trent and HomeServe need to get their act together. HomeServe field engineers were polite and helpful.",HomeServe
"I was very satisfied with the response to my home problem. The first contact was swift and professional. Appointment made, it was kept and a professional plumber came to sort out the leak. Explained the situation and the repair needed. made sure that the job was done well and waited for a while to make sure that no residue drops were following. EXCELLENT! Happy customer.",HomeServe
"The two chaps who came seemed well competent, cleared the drain, were able to tell us where the real problem lay (i.e.upsurge of water from the Severn-Trent mains down the street).  They said this was beyond their technical capacity.",HomeServe
"Had a blocked drain, which flooded our cellar. First drain specialist left saying needing pressure washing. Pressuring washer booked but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show. Got a local builder to come out  and unblock it. Asked for someone to come and pump out cellar. They sent a plumber who thought he was coming to fix a pipe leak. I had to buy a submersible pump and do it myself. Third attendee was knowledgeable but still no high pressure hose.",HomeServe
To date no-one has come to fit the part the plumber saidwas  needed. He was here only 5 mins but he was courteous and polite.,HomeServe
Easy to book appointment on line. Very pleasant and efficient service from the plumber who attended,HomeServe
I took up an offer of a very cheap 12 month deal from this company a few years ago and ended up making a claim for a broken drain pipe. Have no complaints about how they dealt with my issue. I didnt renew after 12 months though as the normal monthly cost I think is too high.I have just taken up another cheap deal for another 12 months.,HomeServe
We called as we had a leaking toilet cistern in a vanity unit. The plumber arrived in the time slot given and fixed the problem,HomeServe
"The process was straightforward and fairly simple. However as the engineer didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t arrive until 18:00 hrs and found a small leak in the upstairs toilet cistern. I remained unconvinced that it was the total cause of the additional water usage, the engineer would or could not remain whilst further test were carried out as he still had further calls to make. Subsequent tests still revealed a leakage of approx two litres per hour even with the household stopcock turned off.",HomeServe
the plumber if you can call that spent most of the time on the phone  couldnt do the job and told me to get a plumber for it wont be renewing my contract,HomeServe
"Making an appointment was so easy and the time of arrival fantastic.  The man fixed our kitchen sink which is not really good and he also renewed taps in bathroom basin.  On his second visit he had to replace the toilet completely and this was carried out very efficiently, no fuss, perfect job.",HomeServe

"Very easy to book on line.  Plumber came the next day,  on time,  very polite and got the job done.  Fitted a new part. Excellent service.",HomeServe
"Took sometime to get the job completed, I was told the Ã¢â‚¬Å“specialÃ¢â‚¬Â parts we on order but that was untrue as the engineers who eventually completed the job obtained the pipe work from the local Tool Station. We were left without mains water for 3 days.",HomeServe

Great members of staff very helpful.My recent leak fixed with no problem only had a small wait.,HomeServe
Engineer came out quickly. Changed taps in bathroom no charge. Very pleased with performance as it is the first time I needed help. Thank you!,HomeServe
"The Homeserve engineer found the location of a manhole which we didn't even know existed, exposed the manhole cover and raised it - none of which was straightforward - then found, and removed, roots which were causing a partial blocking of the drainpipe. This solved what has been an intermittent problem for quite some time. Excellent job.",HomeServe
"The Engineer turned up in time. He took no time in getting to the root of the problem (main drains). He ensured that not only was the blockage cleared, but made sure any residual residue was also cleared out. Overall he did a great job.",HomeServe
Repair and replacement mixer tap done within 6 hours of phoning excellent.,HomeServe
"Our shower has a leak. The pipe to the shower specifically. However. Homeserve conveniently don't cover our type of shower (they cover everything else except thermostatic) - and because its connected to the shower, they won't fix it. Frankly a con, and truly useless company.Edit - reducing this to one star as the company deemed it appropriate to share 'engineer notes' publicly and has given the example of how subtle their cover wording is. Do better.",HomeServe
"The service was first class from start to finish of the process, from the ease of the booking to the speed of the appointment.The plumber that attended was first class and very professional and efficient.Well worth the price of the policy.",HomeServe
"Had the leaking water mixer taps changed in both toilets. One plumber was swift, the other was not experienced enough and took 3 hours, still left a leak. But the leak got sorted out the next day. In both cases the customer provided the new taps / drain plugs of his choice. No fuss. Should be good for the next 20 to 30 years.",HomeServe
Did good job of the leak but the drive is not level after being reinstated,HomeServe
"Very nice engineer. Unfortunately, the pipe that was leaking is still leaking (although much less than originally!). Very prompt service.",HomeServe
"Excellent and quick response by HomeServe. I called them out as the toilet cistern had been playing up. The guy did a thorough job and was polite and courteous. The only reason it's a 4 star is because the flush has played up once since then, but I'm sure if I recalled them they would sort it if necessary.",HomeServe
First time I called over a blocked drain I was told someone would be with me on Friday. I took a day off work and waited in but no-one showed up. I called at 5 pm and was told there were too many emergencies and no-one was available but someone would come on Monday. Someone did come and unblock the drain but said another team would have to come with a camera to investigate further. He came Friday morning but could no find a reason for the problem. Ovwr the weekend I noticed I still had a blocked drain so I called again and was told someone would be with me that day. However around 3pm I had a call to say that due to emergencies no one would be coming until the next day. When he turned up the next day he quickly unblocked the drain and checked everything and assured me that I would have no more problems. So far so good. However there are still two bags of contaminated gravel which the first man left saying a specialist company would remove.,HomeServe
"the homeserve plumber arrived on time, was polite and efficient and completed the work swiftly.",HomeServe
"We had a tap which was broken. I thought that Homeserve would simply mend the tap but instead they fitted a new, superior one which we are very pleased with.",HomeServe
Had a blocked toilet. First engineer sussed out the problem and arranged for a second one to visit. He arrived quickly and sorted the problem. Excellent friendly service and easy to arrange. Would definitely recommend this company,HomeServe
"The plumber came when arranged and solved the problem of a blocked toilet quickly,",HomeServe
Quick call out - within 24 hours. Found 3 leaks under the sink (we thought it was one) repaired them all and replaced tap. Very happy.,HomeServe
"Even though not an emergency, plumber came out next day. Fixed the leak in no time. Excellent service all round.",HomeServe
As a senior I found online challenging. I had an overflowing drain and there was nowhere to click for that. Then I telephoned and that was great. Very helpful operator. The man came to fix my drain the same day. He was terrific and I was greatly relieved.,HomeServe
"The leak was repaired on the second visit hence the 4 stars , it could have been rectified on the first visit but it wasn't so the leak continued for a while longer which has seized the lock on the front door which cannot be used at present .",HomeServe
Engineer was clear and knowledgeable and gave good advice on the leak from our bathroom.,HomeServe

Excellent professional and friendly service from your plumber and your administrative staff. All problems solved quickly and efficiently.,HomeServe
I realised that I had a problem over the Christmas holiday but delayed calling Homeserve until 2nd January as I was not home for a few days. I was given an appointment for 5th of January between 12 and 6 pm. At 5.15 pm that day I was called to tell me they were not coming to me. I only have one toilet and at 80 years of age I am unable to lift buckets of water to flush. I was given a new appointment for the following week on 11th January. This meant my water consumption increased by 300% from 25th December.The plumber arrived and replaced a part in the cistern and also replaced a length of pipe feeding into the cistern.,HomeServe
"Engineer arrived  and attended to blockage in good time . Very pleasant gentleman and very good at his job. Well done , Sir !",HomeServe
"As usual the response to site was good, we have a tenant who is constantly blocking the drains. I have a real issue with the fact that as the customer of Homeserve i should be getting some sort of report and very rarely do unless I demand one. I feel this is an area where you let yourselves down.I have not been able to put in an exact date for the visit as neither yourselves or the letting agency have informed us.",HomeServe
The drainage and plumber men came to investigate a blockage in a main drainage pipe from an upstairs lavatory. It took 4 hours to eventually find the blockage cause and remove and repair the soil pipe. The 2 Marks who did the job were brilliant. Altogether a very good experience with Homeserve. Thanks for fixing the problem.,HomeServe
I tried to ring the company to tell u how great the the eng was .For some time seven Trent told me the leak was on my property when your eng came out found leak was on pavement and l have been paying for leaking water,HomeServe
Very poor. First engineers broke tap. Then said it would have to bed in when fitting a new washer. Emergency engineer came out and had to refere the job.  We had to wait another week to get job done.,HomeServe

I reported a toilet overflow problem. A plumber arrived about 4 hours later. Fixed it in 30 minutes. What excellent service I gratefully received.,HomeServe
Prompt attendance .polite plumber and sorted out the leak,HomeServe
"called them when we had a broken tap resulting in no water in upstairs.  Homeserve called same day and put something in place to help us intil new tap could be ordered and installed.  Unfortunately did not call on day arranged due to tap not available not their fault but called next day with new tap and installed and turned water back on upstairs, excellent service",HomeServe
Signing up for the plumbing and drainage policy was very straightforward.,HomeServe
after 3 call outs plus one cancellation the engineer that you sent twice still didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what to do we now have wait 2 more days with a blocked toilet. The 2nd call out made the problem worse .,HomeServe
The plumber knew exactly what to do and installed tap promptly,HomeServe
It was very easy and quick for me to take out a policy on line to cover my home plumbing.,HomeServe
"Jobs were indoor stopcock tap replacement and bathroom sink tap replacement - both leaking.Positives - Really prompt booking online service. Appointments available to suit me. Both engineers who attended were professional, courteous and very clean and tidy workers. Got the jobs done well - thanks Shane and DJ.Negatives - Unfortunately I did still have to buy one of my own parts (bathroom tap) as the parts offered are not like-for-like. This is even though the service contract includes parts as well as labour. As such one of the jobs had to be rescheduled and this meant a very very long hold on the phone to book the follow up visit. The request for the same engineer did not come to fruition but again engineer was excellent.",HomeServe
The plumber was really friendly and helpful. He identified the problem and repaired immediately by replacing the defective part.,HomeServe
"Managed to get an engineer booked nice and quickly, using the online booking service. Engineer arrived on time. He quickly worked out the problem and repaired my leaking toilet.",HomeServe
Response time to our problem was slow. In the end the problem was the main drainage in the street.,HomeServe

Easy booking system Excellent communication throughout Very knowledgeable plumberQuick and successful repair Overall high quality service,HomeServe
"The plumber came promptly and repaired our leak, which we were very grateful for. However, we did have to find our policy and debate for a while over the phone with the operator when he arrived, that the repair was indeed covered by our policy, as the operator in the office originally maintailed it was not.",HomeServe
"The plumber came & fixed the problem with new parts, he also kept the area clean.IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m happy with him.",HomeServe
I reported a dripping tap was told by the plumber he couldn't get to the unit and was told I had to buy a new mixer tap which he would fit. Therefore I still have a dripping tap.,HomeServe
"Response to my reported leak was, reassuringly, very quick.Plumber identified issue, explained the problem to me and what he'd do to fix it. As he had the necessary parts to do so on his van, he replaced the damaged items leaving me happy in the knowledge that he'd done a professional job.",HomeServe
An repair service was arranged shortly after my claim. The plumber came as scheduled and finished the repair just in a few minutes with hassle free.,HomeServe
"Website easy to use to book in initial visit, plumber turned up on time in the morning - unheard of with any IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve booked myself ?! He quickly got to work investigating, found the job more complicated than we had hoped so booked in more services for the following week, returned exactly as/when promised and completed the job in a timely and tidy way ! CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be happier ! Thanks mark (I think his name was? ) and team Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸ÂÂ½",HomeServe
Tried to book an appointment and only allowed to do so with the automated service so couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t explain the issue. Plumber turns up I explain the issue and he says canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do anything IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come back another day with someone else. Second appointment arranged 8-1 a few days later. Gets to 1.30 heard nothing. Ring homeserve and told someone will ring my back in 10 minutes. 3.30 still no phone call. Ring again and told someone will call me back again but was told when they get to it. Two days later not heard anything so ring again. New appointment gets booked in they have a Quick Look contradict everything the first guy said and tell em there is no problem other than user error! Ã‚Â£30 plus a years subscription what a waste of money to spend three days at home waiting for them to Ã¢â‚¬Å“fixÃ¢â‚¬Â my issue!,HomeServe
Two excess charges  (one to tighten a screw on the bath tap ) do the the monthly payments plus 30 pounds to tighten a bath tap when he was already here for the other job is a bit steep (If I had been well I could have done it myself and he didn't tighten the tap itself which was obviously   loose as well),HomeServe
"Had to wait a while but hopefully that was just due to the Christmas period.Service was really good though , easy and when the drainage engineer arrived he sorted the issue straight away.",HomeServe
"Easy to speak to someone, got an appointment within 24 hours and job was done quickly and efficiently. Plumber was very pleasant as was the person I spoke to on the phone",HomeServe
We rang the Homeserve at one o-clock for a plumber and he was here at two o clock and the job done. You could not beat such service.,HomeServe
"Unreliable, when you have a leak they cancel your appointment without notice, while you wait in all day for them.A lot of money for poor service",HomeServe
I phoned Anglia water .Intially computer voice an issue as couldnt get the issue understood - ie That the water system generally fine - just a problem with one cold tap not functioning .but once i talked to a person - it was fine .Plumber attended on 12/1/24 pleasant and professional - but said it was a job for internal plumber- rattgher than him - who did outside jobs . plumber booked in for 18/1/24 very pleasant - explained the issue - sorted Thanks,HomeServe
"Very quick service, phoned in the morning and they were round and l had a new tap fitted before five the same day. The person who came was very friendly and efficient .",HomeServe
Plumbing & drains went the extra mile. It was a drain blockage in a shared drain in my neighbours property due to roots. As the drain was shared they could have left it & said it was Yorkshire Water's responsibility. I greatly appreciate the unblocking being done at the time of the flooding & bad weather,HomeServe
Contacted about a faulty valve on a radiator on a Friday. Arrived within 3 hours but due to the fact that the system may have needed draining re scheduled for Tuesday next week when he was allocated more time.Arrived Tuesday struggled at first to fit valve without having to drain system but managed in the end. took about 2 1/2 hours.,HomeServe
"I visited the Homeserve website after being prompted by a leaflet from Yorkshire Water. The policy was easy to understand, the process was quick, efficient & cost effective so I am now covered for my plumbing & drains for the next 12 months. Enormous piece of mind just in case we encounter any unforeseen problems & so cheap it would have been rude not to invest!",HomeServe
"The plumber came and didn't clear the blockage and suggested I phone the water board,who came and cleared it straightaway",HomeServe
Problem was a blocked drain. The drain was a shared drain So the man from HomeserveUK was unable to clear the blockage and called Northumbrian Water to send a engineer to carry out a drain clearance. The dÃ…â€¢ains were cleared by the Water company.,HomeServe
"The cover is good value, with plenty of options to insure only specific aspects of plumbing, drainage, heating etc. The application process is straightforward and quick to complete.",HomeServe
Expert job  by  keran to sort out my wonky kitchen tap,HomeServe
"The plumbers who came out were very helpful and considerate, the guy who sorted my taps was great.I was slightly surprised by how little my insurance policy included, it is the basic one, and even more surprised that the guys doing the repairs donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t carry sealant on their van. This was only compensated by how nice their plumbers are.",HomeServe
The plumber called to say he would arrive within 10 minutes. Job was completed quickly and satisfactory. From reporting the problem via website and getting an appointment was only 2 days,HomeServe
We were able to book a plumber for next day to fix a leaky tap. He fixed this efficiently.,HomeServe
Had several plumbers out but not resolved over 2/ week periodHad new drainage laid myself I feel homeserve just washed their hands of the problem their hands,HomeServe
Very friendly and hardworking guy. Found the blocked drain quickly but hard work to clear it. Got their though. Well done.,HomeServe
"Very helpful phone service, engineer booked and leak found and was then quickly fixed.",HomeServe
"I had a leak, which was difficult to detect, so there was quite a bit of water on my half-landing by the time IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d found the source of the problem.  I found it on Wednesday evening, and the first appointment available was not until Saturday morning.  I decided not to look for an emergency plumber, as I was already paying for HomeServe.  This meant that I had to empty the water frequently from the bowl I was using to catch it. By Thursday evening, I decided to contact HomeServe again, and was told there was an appointment on Friday morning, which I accepted. The young man who came had a tricky job fixing the leak, but eventually found a solution to the problem, and it's been fine since.",HomeServe
The contractor came and fixed my overflow leak and was very polite,HomeServe
"He was efficient , quick and had to work hard to get to the leak. He was tidy and washed  done the site. Thank you.",HomeServe
"Turned up on time, was a very pleasant young man, repaired the leak , very good service",HomeServe
"The engineer broke the dishwasher outlet pipe when changing the Kitchen tap. The dishwasher was required to be taken out to change the tap. The dishwasher movingÃ‚Â in and out has been doneÃ‚Â veryÃ‚Â carelessly and pushed beyond the lengthÃ‚Â of the outlet pipe and it finally caused the outletÃ‚Â pipe to breakÃ‚Â almost 99%.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  The damage was noticed when the engineer struggled to put the dishwasher back in and pushed hard in and out to fit the dishwasherÃ‚Â back in.Ã‚Â I have asked the engineer to fix it. He checked in his car and came out saying he didn'tÃ‚Â have theÃ‚Â glue toÃ‚Â seal to fix it.LookingÃ‚Â at the hose cut and its freshness everyoneÃ‚Â can easily tell it is new damage that happened today. No water damage anywhere near the outlet hosepipe. Raised a complaint with Homeserve not sure how long it is going to be resolved.Ã‚Â The dishwasher is the one we use daily and not working the dishwasherÃ‚Â is very stressful especially since we called someone to fix the dripping pipe and causingÃ‚Â major damage. It is going to cost my time, stress and money forÃ‚Â damage caused by the homeserve engineer doing his job very carelessly. Finally, the dishwasherÃ‚Â was not fit back in, and screws and metal brackets were left outside.Ã‚Â Not sure of any additional damage to the dishwasher.",HomeServe
Arrived very quickly and Very quickly unblocked the sewer,HomeServe
"My wife called the HomeServe on 8.01.24 regarding the problem with our toilet. We got the appointment same day and engineer came at the appointed time and fixed the problem. We are happy so far, the toilet is working fine.",HomeServe
Booked Engineer as we were having a water leak in bathroom causing staining on ceiling below. The booking process was very easy and I got an appointment within a couple of days. The Engineer turned up on time and was very friendly and within a couple of minutes diagnosed the problem. A new set of pipes was required and a new booking was made by him on the phone for the day after. He returned the next day and installed the new pipes. Problem fixed!He was friendly and very efficient and we would definitely recommend.,HomeServe
We have just had a guy from Homeserve to fix our tap. What a really nice man. His name was Keiron. Firstly he put covers over his shoes which i was impressed with. Not many do this.Very very friendly. Talked us through everything he was doing. Very professional. Unfortunatly he couldn't fix our tap so he replaced it with a new tap. Before he left he cleaned up after himself. Told us if we had any problems to get in touch with Homeserve,HomeServe
Told me the problem but they cant fix it have to now find a plumber to do the work,HomeServe
Pipe as leaking im my house i call home serv as emergency They told me plumber will arrive bett12 and 6 i been waiting home no one turn up when i call theh said he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t coming to he will come tomorrow I get upset,HomeServe
Problem was quickly remediedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ mains water leak under blockwork driveway!Minimal disturbanceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ everything returned to normal.,HomeServe
Visit booked for morning.  Received a call in afternoon saying eng held up.  He eventually arrived about 6-6.30 pm.  Showed him where the water had come through the integral garage ceiling and the bucket and bowl under the spot.  Told him I went into garage to freezer and saw water leaking.  He looked at rad in living room and found nothing thereTold me to take photo next time it happens.  I told him that I just happened to go into garage to freezer and found water coming from ceilingHe was here for roughly 30 minutes wasn't told that I would get another visit to find leak.  Not very satisfactory.,HomeServe
They didn't put a camera down the pipe as we'd already done this with a broom handle attached to a mobile phone. As we couldn't understand why everything was blocked up after we'd flushed pipes out.The problem - a broken waste water pipe resulting in raw sewage overflowing from manhole on my lawn.Guys came quickly as this was an emergency. They hand dug my lawn up as couldnt get the machinery down my steps. They worked hard til problem was fixed.,HomeServe
The engineer was very prompt and carried out the repair to the bathroom toilet efficiently and speedily and was very mindful that my wife was present and had mobility issues when answering the front door.,HomeServe
Quick response when I phoned.When the plumber came he was quick polite and new exactly what to doI can recommend this company 100%,HomeServe
Excellent serviceProblem with cold water tank in loft. water valve was seized and tank overflowing.Made claim and plumber was around very quickly. Very polite and efficient.,HomeServe
"Excellent service for sink tap replacement and toilet flush system replacement.  The company has very quick response times .Very polite and professional staff.I have been with Homserve for more than 10 years, and use their full package of emergency support.  Electrics, Boilers, Plumbing internal and external. pest control.  Have used all of these services over the years.  They have delivered 100% professional service on every occasion. Highly recommend if you want quick service and not worry about the quality of professional skilled person you get.",HomeServe
"The chap was very nice and got my leaking tap sorted quickly, very good",HomeServe
"Did not fix problem. Stating that they do not fix ant damage to tiles etc, I would have to go through my insurance,  I am paying for a plumber to come in, sort the problem and make good any damage caused to not property. This service is a complete waste of time and moneyThere reply is rubbish, the leak was not fixed the problem is not the bath seal, as i still have the original leak.  However, I do not believe they are capable of even finding the leak never mind fixing it.  They are however, exceedingly good at making excuses",HomeServe
Plumber was very efficient and explained the problems clearly and simply,HomeServe
"On the positive side, the problem ( a leak in the toilet flush) was resolved quickly and efficiently. The reason for only 4 stars was that I had 3 toilets with the same problem. The fitter said each toilet was a separate job and I would have to make 2 more appointments to get them repaired (at a cost of Ã‚Â£30 each!). When the problem was identical and only took 10 minutes to repair one, it seemed a little 'jobsworth' not to do all of them while he was here. I have now bought the parts and will repair the others myself",HomeServe
"water leak after changing the flush, caused stains in the ceiling, I rang up and the next day the engineer came to replace the faulty part. Now I have to get some one to paint the ceiling.",HomeServe
"The guy that came out was thorough, helpful and efficient and sorted the leak out.",HomeServe
"From start to finish, bearing in mind that I'm ""vulnerable"" and have a Blue Badge, when our toilet flush stopped working to when it was mended the service on the telephone call centre and the workmen who came were absolutely first class .. no complaints whatsoever.",HomeServe
Outstanding service from both telephone and engineers. On visiting our property the engineer found we had a leak on an external pipe from there road in to our house. The cost of pipe was so deep the rescheduled for a week later and the team of 2 came to sort the issue which they did with no problems on a day which was in negative figures and continual icing of the surrounding water. I can't recommend this service enough.,HomeServe
"I have been with Homeserve for many years and have only used them three times in probably 7 years .Including my latest call out last week.I had a problem with a small sink in my cloakroom with a dripping tap and a leaking trap when the plumber arrived,he said he could only repair one or the other and I said well the leaking trap is more important so repair that why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you repair the dripping tap as well.He said thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a separate job and you will have to make another phone call and make another job which was going to cost me a further Ã‚Â£30 callout fee which I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think was fair as the problem was on the same sink and the plumber was already at my house. So I called HomeServe and the woman there called Jenny flatly refused to allow the plumber that was already at my house to replace a 50p washer on my leaking tap having been a customer for so long and paid so much money I felt quite angry and let down about their customer service. I threatened that I would leave if they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t repair the leaking tap on my sink. Jenny wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bothered at all and said thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you. I said are you prepared to lose my Ã‚Â£205 a year for the sake of a 50p tap washer, she said itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you read your terms and conditions. The plumber repaired the water trap but did not repair my leaking tap so I wrote an email of complaint to HomeServe. They got back to me within a couple of days and the guy from HomeServe just kept parroting the same things as Jennie about reading my terms and conditions and they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to budge, and if I want my leaking tap repaired, I would have to pay for another call out.I have since cancelled my plumbing insurance policy with HomeServe because of their appalling customer service. Actually they did me a big favour because I have the same cover from British Gas at Ã‚Â£65 instead of Ã‚Â£205, so goodbye HomeServe hello British Gas IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve saved Ã‚Â£140. Thanks to your appalling customer service Ã¯Â¿Â¼Ã¯Â¿Â¼",HomeServe
Our bath mixer tap started leaking quite badly. I phoned Homeserve who answered quickly and arranged for a plumber to visit 2 days later - which was fine. The plumber let us know when he was on his way and carried out the repair efficiently. He was knowledgeable and friendly. Altogether a positive experience.,HomeServe
"The engineers rang before he came asking what type of cylinder we have. Got it and came and replaced the broken part, cleaned up and ensured it was working before he left. He was very efficient, polite and good at his job. Thank you.",HomeServe
"Had an appointment booked for today and the time frame they provided was 12:00 - 18:00. CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t narrow down the time for meThe operator on the phone was very rude as she tried to tell me my situation wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an emergency! I waited until 17:00 on a Saturday! Cancelled all my plans because of the blocked drain causing a mess in my garden, and they decided to send me a text message to say they are no longer able to attendCustomer service cannot get more appalling than that",HomeServe
"Shoddy service.Had no water since 20/1.They will not even attempt to repair until 30/1.Have a 3 year old, can't bathe flush toilet use washing machine etc.11 phone calls, several emails promising customer service will be in touch, still waiting.Save your money, don't give it to these Muppets.Look below for yet another pack of lies about caring from their ""happy to help"" team. Boringly predictable now, but no one will be likely to contact me from customer service until after 30/1. Utterly useless",HomeServe
"Called up due to leaking pipe, got an appointment for the next day even though it was a Sunday. Expert who came out was efficient and stayed for as long as it took to repair issue.",HomeServe
"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been with HomeServe for a number of years but have had to call them twice in the last few weeks for two non related leaks. The first was resolved satisfactorily after an initial problem. The second was to fix a leaking pipe. Quite clearly my policy covers leaking pipeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s but apparently not this one. The engineer who was a nice enough chap explained that because this pipe was connected to an expansion vessel on my hot water cylinder it was not covered. He suggested I check my policy documents which I did. Sure enough there it was on page 15 of 17 of the documents. This particular leaking pipe is not a leaking pipe that HomeServe cover. On the first page of my documents the first item under Ã¢â‚¬Å“whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coveredÃ¢â‚¬Â is leaking pipes!The issue I have is that when I tried to book the engineer for this repair I got so far on the website then a message popped up saying I had to call a given number to complete the booking for the engineer to visit. I believe the reason for this was that the online form asked for more detail of the problem I had. I clearly stated that the leak was from an overflow pipe connected to the hot water cylinder. So the first question I have for HomeServe is 1) Why ask me to call a given number to continue with the booking if this leaking pipe was not covered?When I called the given number I was through to a robot and the engineers visit was booked, after paying my excess. Basically I have paid Ã‚Â£30 only to be told by the engineer that this leaking pipe was not covered on my policy. Sharp practice or what, a complete farce and waste of my time and money. I believe they knew this claim was not covered even before I called the number they asked me to call. I definitely wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t renew with them. My advice is find an alternative insurance company. Especially one that makes it obviously clear that not all leaking pipes are leaking pipes!",HomeServe
"Replaced broken pipe on the washing machine.Good job, friendly engineer.",HomeServe
It was very easy to fill in the form to take out cover for my drains.,HomeServe
CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe plumber here within three hours from my initial call to Homeserve  Job all completed less than half an hour later.  Amazing.  Well done.,HomeServe
Rapid response. Plumber arrived on time. Leak fixed. All excellent.,HomeServe
Easy to make an appointment. Service available at short notice. Agent (Tom) quickly resolved the plumbing problem and was friendly and informative.,HomeServe
Plumber went above and beyond to help me with good advice,HomeServe
Quick to attend to the blockage.  Very pleasant person was able to sort the problem.,HomeServe
Impressive Twice I have called and each time the engineer provided great service and fixed my plumbing issues quickly with no mess. On second call out I rang late afternoon so had to wait for issue to be fixed the next day. On the first call out I  rang early and the engineer arrived a few hours later. Service is so good that I am going to take out the electric cover also.,HomeServe
"I had set up the claim to deal with a dripping shower tap. When the engineer looked at the job he told me it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a cartridge not a tap. I totally failed to understand the difference. However, I then asked for an opinion about the plug fitting on the hand basin that I assumed wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be covered but was delighted when he told me that was covered and he proceeded to replace the unit.",HomeServe
"The plumber who visited our property to find and mend a water leak in our kitchen was fab. He persevered until he found the problem, which wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t obvious, and then sourced and fitted appropriate parts which has cured the problem completely. He was friendly and respectful at all times. Fab job thank you!",HomeServe
"I was disappointed that due to my outside tap not being able to repair, it was not replaced. The plumber just capped the pipe. I thought I was covered for repair or replace. I am talking about replacing approximately 2 feet of pipe work.",HomeServe
Rang at 8.30 and leak fixed by 10.30 ! Very pleased,HomeServe
Homeserve were brilliant and your wonderful plumber did all he could to help. The big problem was Yorkshire water they are terrible,HomeServe
"Fantastic service, phoned  at 9am. Engineer arrived at 12:40. Job sorted. Lee Peach was the plumber.",HomeServe
"Although leaky pipes are mentioned in the policy this leak was from the Shower pump and so was ""internal"" and not covered. We had a week of leaking before employing a plumber to fix it. This could have been avoided if your engineer had only told us about the isolating valves which could have been turned off.",HomeServe
The plumber who came didn't really seem interested in doing the job. I don't know about plumbing. But I wouldn't let him totally dismantle the toilet like he wanted. I got a different plumber and he fixed the problem in less than 10mins,HomeServe
"Turned up when they were expected.Very quick with dealing with problem and most of all, the plumber was such a pleasant, helpful and courteous man.",HomeServe
"The plumber was excellent in every way, but the scheduling left a lot to be desired. The first plumber didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep his appointment. It was rearranged, but they came at the exact time when I had told them no one was available - almost deliberate. Arranged for the following day, in the morning. Fortunately I checked online and found it was booked in for the afternoon!!!!I amended it online to the morning as a slot was available. What was the agent up to?",HomeServe
"The handle had broken on our downstairs toilet and we found it a nuisance having to go upstairs all the time, as we are in our 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s.The technician arrived promptly, did the job very quickly and was polite.",HomeServe
"Plumber came quite quickly after telephoning Homeserve.  He was polite, friendly and professional.  Leak was repaired with no fuss and area of work was left clean and tidy.  Pleased with service.",HomeServe

Engineer did his job but my problem was not solvedMy sewer pipes keep blocking up every 7-8 weeks the two manholes are full to top and overflowing They are cleared then it happens again and againI am 81 and live on my own it is very distressing for meIt has even come up another drain all over patioThere is something very wrong somewhere and I am waiting for it to happen againNext time I do not want someone to clear it I want it sorted out once and for all,HomeServe
"The engineer rang to say he was on his way. When he arrived he was very pleasant, explained what he was doing to test if I had a leak, which I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have, and reassured me all was well in my property.",HomeServe
"Had a major flooding issue whenever it rained. Homeserve came the next day and identified the problem as overgrown roots in the pipe. A specialist crew came 2 days later with machinery to cut roots and insert sleeve into the underground pipework. The problem is now resolved and have had no further issues. The staff were prompt, on-time, professional and ensured the work was fully completed and tested before leaving.",HomeServe

The engineer was very polite and professional.",HomeServe
Plumber was good and quick. However to get him to the house I had to follow up multiple times. Agent said i can get emergency services if I pay 30Ã‚Â£. I paid excess and still had to wait till next day to get it sorted. And meanwhile i had to my own workarounds(atleast tried) and had to stay without water. I see very little benifit with this service,HomeServe

It was ok at first - the plumber came and fixed my leaking pipe.

Quick response to a leaking toilet valve,HomeServe
I was advised by Anglian Water that I might have a leak due to the fact that my water meter was recording usage 24/7. I could not trace the leak myself so telephone for a plumber's assistance via my HomeServe UK policy. The plumber arrived the next day and carried out an extensive search of every bathroom/toilet and water storage systems within the house.He traced the leakage to two different toile cisterns and one dripping tap all of which he remedied whilst on site,HomeServe
2 plummers attended and discussed options Clean job and very efficient,HomeServe
"The plumber was excellent. Very pleasant to converse with, had some great advice and diagnosed and fixed the problem swiftly.",HomeServe
There is a detailed review of an emergency claim going on. The faulty tap is not replaced by the personnel but we need to buy the tap.,HomeServe
"Really good service, kind and friendly man who got the job done and fixed the leak",HomeServe
"We had a problem with a leaking tap, phoned in the morning, engineer came on the same day in the afternoon replaced the mixer tap and fixed the problem !",HomeServe
Making a claim with HomeServe was made easy I was able to do everything on line and a engineer was appointed and arrived the following day to fix the pipe that was leaking,HomeServe
"From the first telephone call, you recognised me from my land line number and set up an appointment for the following week. I did not speak to a human!I received a call from you saying the engineer was delayed by a couple of hours and would be in attendance at a given time.He turned up looked at the loft ball cock problem, shut off the main water and fitted a new valve. Water back on tested flow all good and total time in situ 15 minutes.Brilliant, I am very impressed and offer my thanks for a great service....II am not easily impressed these days!!",HomeServe
Good service and helpful advice by Plumber on management of new taps.,HomeServe
Underground repair done on time and pleased with it.Only downside was that 2 bags of rubbish was left on the roadside for over a week before it was collected.,HomeServe
"Poor response time, poor customer service, poor complaints system pleasant and helpful plumbers when they eventually get there. Think twice about this product if you live outside the main urban centres in Scotland. I had home emergency insurance for plumbing and had a leak inside the house. Water was continuously running from an internal wall.  It took Homeserve 4 days after asking for a plumber for them to contact me to give me a plumber appointment, On the day of the planned visit, 5 days after initial contact, I was informed that the appointment had been changed to the next day. The plumber arrived at 6.30pm after a 3h drive, looked at the leak but felt that it would require some time to trace and repair it and did not want to start the job which he couldn't finish quickly. He was on call and seemed to be time limited). His control centre wouldn't allow him to stay locally so that he could complete the job the next day, so he left without doing anything! He was very apologetic and offered to come the following Friday which I said was not satisfactory given the delay I had already experienced. I called Homeserve on next day to see when they were going to do the job. Nobody could give me a clear answer until later that afternoon when I received a call to say a plumber would visit the next day. He arrived at 11am after a 3.5h drive, was very helpful and sympathetic and completed the job. Before any plumbers had arrived, I had asked to speak to a senior manager about the poor response times to an emergency but was told nobody was available. I raised an official complaint to try to expedite a response, but was told that complaints would take 2 working weeks to be dealt with. 3 working weeks later I am still waiting to speak to anybody from Homeserve. I was sold this insurance as ""emergency"" cover. This is not an emergency service. I believe the company is mis-selling its insurance products to those in rural areas away from the large urban centres in Scotland because they do not have the capacity or an understanding of the geography of Scotland to provide the service they advertise.",HomeServe
Easy to make appointment on line. Contacted 30 mins before arrival. The drain specialist was really helpful and ensured that our problem was resolved.,HomeServe
Mainly took this cover for the water supply pipe cover. Seems to be the only thing NOT covered on our house insurance. Price not bad but a lot of cover included we don't really need. What about a water supply pipe cover only Home serve?,HomeServe
The engineer was prompt arriving at my house and he fixed the dripping tap quickly and efficiently.,HomeServe

"It took to long to attend, the water had already been turned off by someone else. The person that attended was nice but still had to get a plumber in to mend the pipe. After paying for a period off 4 years and the excess of Ã‚Â£30. I wonder why I bothered. NOT happy",HomeServe
We had a leak. The repair man came promptly  fixed the issue. First class.,HomeServe
Plumber contacted us to advise when he would be arriving.  Was very helpful and efficient.  The whole process was very good.,HomeServe

The engineer came when I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t home, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d arranged for builders I had working on the property to let him in. I have had no contact since from homeserve and do not know what work was carried out, if my leak has been fixed and if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anything else I need to do.",HomeServe

We made online appointment on a Sunday for a call-out on leaking radiator. An appoint was made for the following Tuesday. Tuesday came and went but no plumber had turned up or contacted us in any way.Phoned on Wednesday and got through and was told the booking had been lost their end but they  could rebook for two days time.This was unacceptable due to cold weather and the radiator being shut off after hanging on for a will we were told they would fit us in later that day. The Plummer turned up and fixed the problem very professionally Whilst on the phone and as my contract would soon be up for renewal why there was such a vast difference between what we were going to be charged and that of a new customer or another supplier but that was not their department we would have to ring sales.,HomeServe
I got an expert sent out to me very quickly and they were very professional and  solved my blocked drain .,HomeServe
The plumber contacted me well before he was due to arrive which was much appreciated so I could tidy up before his arrival.He was very pleasant and very professional.

"My property has been suffering from water ingress  (intermittently) for the last two months.  Homeserve failed to attend the property in due course or to source the leak along with a leak specialist.  As a result, I have warped flooring and the ceiling below my flat eventually caved in.  It was very fortunate that no one was present at the time or they would have suffered serious injuries or possibly death.  I contacted the complaints department and they offered me Ã‚Â£150  compensation.  What a joke!  My property is now going to costs me Ã‚Â£1000Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and Ã‚Â£1000Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s to put right.  All because of a leak that they failed to attend to or find.",HomeServe
"Where do I begin....Work up at 07.00 on Saturday 27th to hear a dripping noise downstairs. Immediately saw water dripping from the ceiling and from the light fitting. Identified the leak was coming from a filter in the airing cupboard. Managed to isolate the filter, but damage done. Turned off all heating.Phoned Home Serve. Spoke to a young lady, first thing she said was Ã‚Â£50.00 excess, credit card no please. She then said, someone will be in contact in the next 4 hours. Not exactly ideal.4 hours passed, nothing heard. Phoned back. Spoke to a guy who said he would transfer me to the booking team. Got cut off. Phoned back, spoke to a different person who did transfer me to the booking team. Was told I would be added to the list. I thought I had been added to the list at 07.30!!Plumber (Rod) eventually turned up. He then told me the leaking part not covered??? Suggested I phone British Gas (who I also have cover with) To be fair he was ok, phoned the office to confirm he hadn't done any work, so refund my Ã‚Â£50.00. This was agreed by lady on the phone, but could take 10 days???I have had no heating or hot water all weekend. I've had to resort to using a local heating engineer who is coming out this afternoon.Not impressed with Home Serve or British Gas. Intend to cancel both policies as absolutely useless.Hence my scores above.",HomeServe
speedy response excellent plumber explains what the problem is does the job and leaves no mess very friendly Thank you your doing a great service,HomeServe
Called as we had a leak downstairs in the toilet and were not sure if it was the main stop tap that was leaking. The person I spoke with was polite and helpful and organised for someone to come to us that day. The plumber arrived at 7.30pm that same day and quickly ascertained that it was a leak from the toilet. He replaced the faulty parts and was on his way to the next call within 30 minutes. He was polite and friendly and kept us informed of what he was doing and also showed us what he had done.We were relieved that the problem was dealt with so swiftly and have no hesitation in recommending Homeserve UK to others.,HomeServe
"The process to get an appointment was easy and the speed of attending was excellent. It was late on a Friday and the Engineer stuck at it but clearly wasn't going to get it fixed, it wasn't causing damage or anything and he needed a second pair of hands and more equipment. He arranged while he was there to turn up on Monday with a colleague and he duly did and fixed the problem.",HomeServe
I reported that my sink flip plug was stuck and I couldn't use the sink. Took them 3 attempts to get the plumber to me. First appointment no one turned up and no phone calls to tell me they couldn't attend. 2nd appointment a drain clearing person turned up. He was external only so couldn't help. He actually rang his company to organise a plumber who turned up the next day and fixed the problem. All of this and having to wait in for 3 all day appointments is time in my life I will never get back.,HomeServe
"The Plummer arrived on time,he was efficient,and friendly.",HomeServe
Shower pump connected to household plumbing system leaked. Fortunately a neighbour was able to isolate this from the system. Minimal damage occurred. Was informed by HomeServe this wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered. However after having spoken to several people including the Diary Manager it was decided (taking into consideration it was the weekend and my age 78) a plumber would come on Sunday the next morning between 08.00 and 13.00. During this conversation it was confirmed several time by my neighbour that the shower pump had been isolated and was no longer leaking. He was thanked by HomeServe for undertaking this.The plumber arrived the next morning around 08.30 with a worksheet stating isolate shower pump! ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all he could do as HomeServe donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover shower pumps. THE SHOWER PUMP WAS ISOLATED THE PREVIOUS DAY. HOMESERVE ALREADY WERE TOLD THIS. Hoping this is classed as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“useful reviewÃ¢â‚¬Â!,HomeServe
"Very bad service. As the plumber take a look of the water leak near the cylinder. He says the leakage come from the parts of the pump. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover. So he left without doing anything for us but your company has charge us of Ã‚Â£30. After that, we find another independent plumber to check for it. He says the leak come from the pipe not the parts of the pump. I consider not to renew service from your company. Actually, it does not help but only charge.",HomeServe
the engineer was excellent however the appointment had to be re-arranged twice which was very inconvenient due to water dripping from the ceiling,HomeServe
Young man who attended to a water leak was very good and very efficient at fixing the leak .When I asked him how is the company to work for he was very complementary about working for Home serveThe down side we had to wait over a week for the work to start.,HomeServe

Very pleasant plumber .very happy with servive,HomeServe
Home serve is amazing as in customer service but the plumbers and people they use arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so. I called out 3x for a job and same plumber came back first time he just gave me a lip service second he did something diagnosed an issue with my pipes that needed a jet washer. The jet washing team came and said nope itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Thames water problem IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve called Thames water who say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not their problem sooo IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m like ahhhh,HomeServe

Arrived on the day with a phone call to say when they would arrive. Blockage was cleared OK.,HomeServe
The gentleman was friendly and polite at all times.  He soon traced and repaired the damaged pipe work and advised that if it still had a problem to call them back as it had meant him having to cement over a area that was the cause of the leak.,HomeServe
My toilet was not working.I contacted Home Serve it was late afternoon. I was informed some would call before 6 pm.Someone arrived shortly after an hour.I showed him the problem and he went to his van and and came back and fitted a new part. He explained how the part worked and said he had fitted many.I told him the response was good. He told he was just going off duty when he got the call.,HomeServe
"I would give the plumber 5 star as he came and knew what had happened and instead of coming again the next day he sorted it while he was there. But I would give customer service 1 or 2 as the lady on the phone was telling us that the plumber was available Tuesday when I am ringing for emergency on a Sunday and the water is pouring under the sink. She was only keen on taking the money. After paying the money and after taking for sometime, after we had to say IT IS AN EMERGENCY and we have a little one in the house. Some how managed toGet the appointment same day. People ring and pay for emergency only. If I could wait for 48 or 72 hours I can get a normal plumber or help from someone who has a skill. The plumber who attended was good and knew what he was doing",HomeServe
I have called HomeServe out on a number of occasions and each time the individual plumbers were very helpful and took the time to advise and answer my questions.  I never felt they were rushing to go onto the next job and gave me the time I needed.  Each time they left the area clean and tidy and were very friendly and polite.  The attendance times are really quick from the initial call to HomeServe and they ring you when they are on their way.  Can't fault them.,HomeServe

"I have cancelled my monthly direct debit after a call from your plumber as apparently the leaks that I reported were not significant enough to warrant a repair!!!I did explain to the call handler that it wasn't a massive leak but he still accepted my request.I'm 80years old live on my own and have been paying home serve over Ã‚Â£200 a year for this so called service plus Ã‚Â£60 excess for the call out and I'm absolutely disgusted with this outcome. The plumber  was very polite and he rang his manager to check if he could do the repairs, this call was made on speaker call and I heard the manager say that ""If she wants the repairs done she will have to pay for them out of her own pocket"" Absolutely disgusting.",HomeServe

"Homeserve has been a life saver in a recent surge of plumbing issues at my property! Customer service is excellent and I highly recommend this supplementary policy to any home owner. I have previously used one of the wider known 'Big Six' energy company home care add-ons, but the service was not great.Particular thanks to Homeserve's outstanding engineer, James B, who has attended my property twice and has gone over and above on both occasions.  During his first visit, James located a potentially disastrous leak whilst fixing our loo.  Today, James was here to repair a damaged exterior faucet, as he was leaving he noticed that my hallway radiator was not working properly - as a lovely gesture of kindness, James popped to his van for some tools and returned to fix it! Thank you so much, what a star! 10/10",HomeServe

"Plumber came out within a few hours of calling to report our problem , he quickly identified and fixed the problem, very polite young man who cleaned up and made sure we had no more leak before leaving our property.",HomeServe
"Very happy with the service we receivedEngineer was very polite and managed to unblock the sink, and we were pleased as it was back to how it should be, we are keeping our eye on it once slowed down since the visit which may have been a bit of waste still in there, and May now have washed away hopefully",HomeServe
Plumber sorted out the problem quickly and efficiently,HomeServe
"Came within 2hours when I had a leak ,Also previously had them out to a blocked drain from kitchen, very thoroughly roded and jet washed.Friendly staff",HomeServe
"Why am I being asked to review only a week after taking out a policy? Anyway, i took out the plumbing and drainage emergency cover as I was offered it at Ã‚Â£1pm for 12 months of cover What is a farce is that it isn't 12 months of cover. It's actually 11 as the (very) small print says that you can't put in a claim for the first 30days. Doesn't bother me so much because of the price I'm getting it for but I won't be renewing at full price.",HomeServe
One of my pipes burst during a brief cold spell. I was unable to fully turn off the stopcock to stem the jet of water but I still had to wait 7 hours for an emergency plumber. I was just grateful that someone eventually turned up but it was a very long wait.,HomeServe
"Engineers arrived on time, were courteous and rectified problems swiftly. Unfortunately this was the second appointment as previous engineer had left us with a slow leak.",HomeServe
"Great guy who came out to fix our leaky loo! Knew straight away what it was, sorted it quickly and replaced flush system as well for us. Clean and tidy, friendly service. Super job, all working fine now. Highly recommend Home Serve",HomeServe
The engineer was on time he tried everything to find the water burst underground after approximately Three and Have Hours he found after digging down approximately five feet to get to the problem and fixing this and filling the holes in He had done A Ten out Ten for the Job he had done Thanks Bob Hayes,HomeServe
"Given an appointment. Plumber arrived on time. Didn't have the necessary part, but went away and purchased and fitted immediately. Happy customer",HomeServe
The original appointment was cancelled at 5pm  by Homeserve after waiting in for 5 hours between 12-6pm . However they made good on their promise to rectify the problem the following day and the plumber arrived just after 4pm the following day and did the repairs to my dripping taps which was done efficently and effectively he was polite and friendly and very capable . Having been a customer for nearly 35 years it was of the standard that i expected .,HomeServe
Homeserve accepted my call for help without question and sent out two very competent engineers - the leak was located quickly and fixed efficiently without fuss and replaced the concrete.,HomeServe
Absoulute great service from AJ. Had issues with a waste pipe wich turned in to a comoplex issue. AJ made sure he kept me up to date with all updates always arrived on time and was very polite and friendly. Sorted the job with no fuss. Many thanks once again. Kettle is always on for you!,HomeServe
Leak got fixed  - quite quickly .,HomeServe
"Because Homeserve only repair the water leak, I feel they have little sympathy for the person, who in my case had to repair the ceiling repair.",HomeServe
"The first engineer that came to the call out was really good, he had to order replacement cartridges for my tap. The second engineer didn't seem to understand why we didn't just get a new tap, he changed the hot cartridge only leaving us with the cold cartridge for use later, although we're nit plumbers so not sure if we'd be able to fit it if required. The hot tap lever had been put back in slightly wonky, which I'm finding annoying",HomeServe
"It was easy to make the appointment for an engineer which as this occurred on a Sunday we were surprised.The appointment was made for the next day,they came on time and were thorough in their assessment.The problem was sorted out in a couple of days which included digging up a path to get to a drain and everything was cleared away with no mess at all.",HomeServe
"Thank you for your prompt answer for my call for help to my shower, the plumber who came was very helpful and put me at ease, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very impressed with your representatives.",HomeServe
I received a letter addressed the the home owner today for drainage cover with Homeserve.  Been on their website and completed the online form to setup the cover (50p per mth for 12 months to start the insurance package).  Very easy to complete.  Ive already received the confirmation that the policy has been setup.,HomeServe
"Pleasant  , and had Respect,  fixed my kitchen taps in no time, nice to know homesite is there when you need help,10 out 10,",HomeServe
The plumber was very helpful and informative. He cleaned up after himself. The work was carried out quickly and efficiently,HomeServe
"The HomeServe plumber was friendly, efficient and got the job done. Amazing work as always.",HomeServe
Plumber was very pleasant and diagnosed the problem correctly.,HomeServe
YOU WERE ON THE BAII FIXING THE LEAK,HomeServe
"Reported the blocked drain using the simple online claim-form, and was soon contacted by a local drain expert who arrived soon after and unblocked the drain. Issue all sorted within a couple of hours of reporting. Great service. Highly recommended",HomeServe
The response was fantastic in the office. And the Plummer was great thank you,HomeServe
"Well it was easy to pay them money, just bought a policy on offer. The reviews you want to read are those from people who've had plumbing and drainage issues while insured.",HomeServe
"Our appointment was brought forward because we are vulnerable.    The technician arrived in good time and despite the drain being in an awkward place he was able to clear the blockage speedily.     Very satisfied,",HomeServe
"The plumber was on time and very helpful, removing the faulty toilet flush handle and replacing it with a flush button.",HomeServe
Plumber who came out fixed the problem very quickly,HomeServe
"Had a leak in the bath waste pipe.Phoned HomeServe and they arranged for a plumber the next day even though I told them it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an emergency.Plumber arrived on time and found 2 leaks which he fixed,so we were very pleased and can now have a bath without flooding the house!!!Well done HomeServe.",HomeServe
"My toilet would not fill up with water after I flushed it. I called Homecare for help. The staff who answered the telephone would not give me an appointment date until I had paid the excess, although I asked her questions her repeated response was that I needed to pay the excess. Once I had done that she informed me that someone would be with me 2 days later. 2 days with a toilet not working! Really! She then put me through to someone who said they could come anytime up to 6pm. I had an urgent appointment for one and a half hours that afternoon and they said they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t accommodate that so they could come the next day. I explained what the problem was and they did not offer any kind of help to temporarily resolve my problem and that there was a possibility that if they did not carry the part it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be repaired and they would need to come back. Thankfully in the mean time I called a friend who explained that I could pour water into the toilet bowl to take waste away or if I lifted the basket in the cistern the water would flow in as a temporary measure until it could be fixed. Why did the person I spoke to not  help with any suggestions! It turned out to be a part that they had fitted previously and thereforeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦did I need to pay the excess? Should the part have been under warranty? I would have scored 0 if it was possible to do so. Not the best customer service.EDIT Your standard electronic response is like your customer service. Try being a bit more human would help.",HomeServe
"Fantastic engineers, plumbers and truly grateful to them for fixing the problems.",HomeServe
"Have used HomeServe a few times over last year or so. Always easy to arrange appointments, which are available within a few days. Engineer has always called ahead.Had them to resolve drain issues (advised about contacting Anglian Water which worked), a leak issue which was fixed within an hour and low hot water pressure which again was fixed quickly. Always leave the house tidy. Have had to call them out again this weekend for more drain issues so hopeful they're as useful as normal.As someone with very little  DIY/Trade skills they've always solved the problem and dealt with it quickly. Would recommend.",HomeServe
A reassuring service from first contacting HomeServe. I was kept well informed regarding when plumbing engineer would arrive. Service provided was very good and although spares for the repair were difficult to obtain I was informed that the item was on order and would be fitted in due course.Repair was completed within a few days and cistern now works perfectly.,HomeServe
"Plumber gave us helpful advice. Glad to have chosen HomeServe, but we prefer to speak to a real person when booking.Thank you.",HomeServe
"Plumber was punctual, polite and friendly, confident and experienced. Quickly assessed there were in fact two separate leaks and explained that he would make a call and ask me to pay a second excess so he could replace both components. Left it clean and tidy.",HomeServe
Mark the plumber was amazing and he was the only person who came that fixed it.,HomeServe
When I rang I told the person on the phone that I had a dripping pipe at the back of the boiler. I paid my Ã‚Â£30 and when your guy arrived he said he could not deal with it. This was not mentioned on the phone by your staff.,HomeServe
"Over the past month we'd had several visits to locate a troublesome leak without any success. Finally, one week ago, we had Martin (gas detection specialist) and Sean (plumber) persevere using a camera detection technique and 'Eureka' the leak was located under our living room floor. Not only did the guys repair the leak they also ensured that the cuts they were required to make into our oak floor boards were repaired. They went well beyond what was expected of them and are obviously true professionals who take a great pride in their work. I can't thank them enough.",HomeServe
Had a blocked drain phoned in the morning if someone can help very helpful on the phone said they would send a engineer out the response was excellent a engineer came out the same day and unblocked the drain he did a great job very professional.Thank-you,HomeServe
Im very happy with the prompt response and the sorting out of the water leaking problem,HomeServe
friendly professional Plumber efficient and very helpful .,HomeServe
"I'm not normally a fan of this sort of insurance, but i took out a water pipe insurance when we moved house recently, for something like Ã‚Â£1 a month as there were some potential areas of concern we had flagged in the new house. Three months in we had a waste drainage problem that we didn't expect. Remembered that we had this insurance, called up and they were out the next day, located the problem, fixed it, found another problem, and fixed that as well. The service was great, they were fast and efficient.",HomeServe
"First engineer fixed leak on bleed valve, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix leak on tap valve and left other valve open.Second engineer fixed 2nd leak but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to get the radiator to heat up so told me to ring up and sort it out myself.3rd engineer identified valve problem and fixed it",HomeServe
Still waiting for someone to get back to us regarding the shower that is still not fixed,HomeServe
From start to finish a stressful experience was made easier by the staff involved. Pipes burst during a freeze and although they must have been very busy each member of staff was very courteous and helpful.,HomeServe
The technician came the same day that I made the claim to inspect the leakage. He explained the situation clearly and thoroughly. Thank you.,HomeServe
Our experience was great I'm not sure about the poor engineer who saw my 92 year old husband cut his finger when the wind blew a door onto it . He told me and said he thought it needed stitches .  .In among the struggle he then had to let in a phlebotomist who had come to do a Blood Test and still managed to sort the drains . I'd say that was an excellent visit from our point of view . Thank you .,HomeServe
"Home serve were very quick to respond to initial call about a leak. A plumber came out approximately one hour later. The job had to be completed at a later date but I was kept fully informed as to what was happening and when. I find it so helpful that the Home serve engineers call in advance to let you know that they are on their way. My only gripe is with the scaffolding company used. I requested that they call ahead but they didn't and communication with them was, on occasion, not responded to. Plumbing job was done to a good standard and I'm very pleased with the service Home serve provided.",HomeServe
Quick fast service and excellent staff turned up to clear the drains,HomeServe
"We had a blocked drain when I called the company out.  My husband manged to clear it after I made the booking.  The chap came, didn't have his work van so no tools!! So  what was the point in coming!!",HomeServe
"Home serve are amazing, we had a main water leak under the floor in our kitchen which had come up in our lounge ruining the carpet and tiles in the kitchen home serve sent a very capable plumber Called Chris Stewart he was brilliant he isolated the leak by putting in a isolation valve he made safe and returned a few days later too dig up floor and find the leak which he repaired by replacing pipe work which had a hole in he then made good the floor , Chris was fantastic real nice bloke who new his job . Thank you home serve and Chris your very good .",HomeServe
"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d give 0 stars if I could. Dealing with a family bereavement is hard enough. My late aunt lived a 3 hour round trip away from me. She had an annual policy for years and never claimed. Her kitchen sink blocked. I rang Homeserve and explained the situation. They gave me an appointment and told me it was 1pm to 6pm. I explained I would be sitting in an empty house and they said they would request the early half of the time slot so I booked it. With snow forecast I phoned the afternoon before my scheduled appointment. This time I was told they were very sorry but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been told wrong. It was a 12 - 6pm slot. The man apologised as he could see I had been told from 1pm. I then had to change an appointment to make the journey to my late aunts house for 12.00. This gentlemen also said there was a request for the early half of the time slot. I was told the engineer would phone in the morning to give me an idea of his time of arrival. So I traveled through sleet and snow to get there for 12.00. At 1.pm IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d heard nothing so phoned again. I explained to the lady who said she understood and would ask someone to phone the engineer. She came back to say he was on a job but would phone be when he finished to give me an idea of time. And that it would Ã¢â‚¬ËœdefinitelyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ be the 1st half of the time slot. At 4:30pm I still hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard anything. I rang again and a different man said someone would definitely be with me before 6pm. I said I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t prepared to wait as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been told what was clearly not true. I  raised a complaint. At 6:08 I had a text message to say the engineer wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t coming and they made an appointment for 4 days later - a date I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do. So I had a 3 hour round trip, in sleet and snow and sat in an empty house all afternoon and the sink is still blocked. Utterly dreadful customer service",HomeServe
"Booked appointment and man arrived a few hours later.  Very efficient, cleared the blockage and checked all flushes before leaving.  Very impressive service.",HomeServe
Good and friendly engineer. My big quibble is that they will no longer empty our sludge filter unless I have provided them with a new set of washers. You'd think it would be in their interest to keep the system free of sludge and when you consider the enormous annual charge for our contract their approach seems penny-pinching in the extreme.,HomeServe
The plumber was very helpful and helped get Yorkshire water on the case who fully rectified the problem .,HomeServe
Very good helpful service I was soon fixed up with the plumber who was on time and fixed my problem in just a few minutes. No mess no fuss he had the parts needed with him . Very good thanks.,HomeServe
This is a good policy for peace of mind. Call outs are usually quick. Be mindful of the small print though. We werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered for our leaky loo because it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one in the house!,HomeServe
Hot water trickling through kitchen sink tap. Water supply and pressure fine in rest of house.Call 1 - said it was okayCall 2 - renewed the faulty tap which was the problemCall 3 the water to washing machine had not been turn back on during previous callNow the tap is not fixed securely to sink so need another call !!!!!!!!When is this problem going to be resolved ?3 calls/ 4 calls is a ridiculous amount to fix a tap.I await your speedy response to this problem,HomeServe
Received a quote through the post for drainage coverage including leaking pipes. As we have recently had a problem with our drains which cost over Ã‚Â£300 for a call out this was a no brainer Everything was easy to understand and the offer for 12 months was excellent and the projected cost is not prohibitiveAfter reading reviews on TP we have decided to take out cover,HomeServe
The plumber arrived the day of the bathroom leak and fixed the pipe to the toilet cistern.,HomeServe
Home Serve's package to protect plumbing sounded very attractive and well worth the small cost for what amounts to 11 months cover. Signing up was easy. The proof of the pudding will come if there is a need to claim,HomeServe
"Had to wait a week for appointment.First visit, Internal engineer couldn't  fix my sink blockage and suggested down pipe might be blocked.Second Visit External Engineer said there was a blockage in the drains but not on my property and to call Anglian Water.He asked me if the internal engineer had used a vacuum under my sink. I said no. As a favour to me he brought his vacuum in and within two minutes had fixed the blockage. He wondered why the first guy hadn't done his.",HomeServe
A very pleasant plumber arrived promptly and did an excellent job,HomeServe
"Plumber arrived on time, he was efficient and helpful.",HomeServe
"Having paid for many years and never claiming, it was good to have that reassurance that it would be fixed with only a Ã‚Â£30 excess. Once the engineer arrived, the blockage was resolved within 20 minutes.",HomeServe
"Highly recommend HomeServe, I have used them numerous times for plumbing issues. Yesterday had to call them as water was dripping through the bedroom ceiling. The eariest callout was Monday, which was 3 days away. I explained the situation & they arrived a few hours later. The young man that came was so helpful & nice, sorted the problem straight away.",HomeServe
"The ability to speak to a human, once in the system. Despite the long wait for plumber, I was warned and the work was quick, accurate and helpful. He had other urgent tasks and therefore turned down the offer of a cup of tea. At 0200 hrs that reveals his loyalty to customers.",HomeServe
It was easy to add Homeserve as an insurance for my home plumbing and blockages etc. But please read the small print so that you know what you are insuring for.,HomeServe
I phoned the company for aid regarding a water leak from a kitchen tap in the morning of February first 2024 a repair man called at 0915 on 3/2/2024.  he wasted no time. the problem was identified and the remedy was completed within 30 minutes.  i was impressed by his  efficiency and manner.,HomeServe
I had a mains water leak from a pipe embedded in concrete and which was beginning to damage the kitchen floor. Two visits were needed but Homeserve were able to locate the source of the leak and then managed to connect to the small accessible part of the pipe. I was advised that it would be touch and go if this was going to be possible. The guy persevered and managed to save the day. I'm so grateful this was possible,HomeServe
Excellent helpful customer service and speedy arrangement of engineers visit to solve our blocked basin problem.,HomeServe
5 visits to fix a leaking downstairs loo which now no longer gives a full flush.,HomeServe
"On time, sorted out my leak quickly Efficient on phone, couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have asked for more",HomeServe
Mark came and sorted us out in a professional and kind way.   We are worried but he cgave us confidence that the leak under the kitchen floor would be fixed.,HomeServe
Service good but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t solve the blockage issue so still had to pay the policy excess. To solve the issue I  then had to call out Anglian Water as the blockage was in their domain.,HomeServe
"Engineer was prompt, had dripping tap fixed very quickly.",HomeServe
Homeserve were excellent - so responsive to any queries and extremely reliable.  Work was carried out to a very high standard and our drain problem has been resolved.  Many thanks.,HomeServe
"We had  a blocked toilet which took visits from 3 engineers before it was sorted.The first diagnosed the problem but did not cure it. He did however call in a drainage expert who came the next day. He moved the toilet and removed the obstruction but did not refit the toilet to my satisfaction.A further appointment was made, 4 days later. In the interim period I refitted the toilet so it could be used. We still had a small leak.The third plumber, Steve, asked me what the problem was, checked it out and fitted a new waste pipe curing the leak  and refitting the toilet afterwards.Unfortunately it took 6 days to finish the job  but the end result is a working not blocked or leaking toilet, all that I wanted.",HomeServe
"Very quick and efficient appointment arranged, work  completed quickly  by a very friendly and efficient plumber, would highly recommend",HomeServe
"Really nice plumber, carried out work really good.",HomeServe
The plumber turned up at the time expected. He had the necessary spare parts in his van and he fitted them quickly. He was courteous and efficient. Job well done!,HomeServe
Excellent customer service i had a problem with one of my bathroom tap was dripping engineer come in a same day and solve the problem very quickly very happy for the work of engineer very proffesional and tidy overall all excellent 5 plus star many thanks,HomeServe
Your lady engineer Donna was really great- hard working diligent and very professional- sadly could not find the real cause of our problem- but she confirmed there were no leaking pipes internally,HomeServe
We had a dripping bathrooms tap. We had 2 plumbers come around different days. We wanted them to change our taps! We had a new one ready to be fitted. But both plumbers could not get the old taps off! To fit the new one! So they just changed the washers in the old taps. The taps are still dripping now! So they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really fix our dripping taps!,HomeServe
"The plumber who visited was very polite, professional and solved the problem. Thanks Homeserve for providing an amazing service..",HomeServe
"I was pleased with my recent experience with the plumber who came in to fix my leaking bathroom faucet from Homeserve. The plumber was on time and he also alerted me before his arrival , he was courteous, polite and professional. He explained fully what he was going to do and the difficulty he was experiencing. He was honest about the possible outcomes and what he could do to mitigate them in the event he had not solved the problem. I was very pleased with the outcome. Thank you Homeserve.",HomeServe
Cannot rate Homeserve highly enough.  Very easy to book appointment and the plumber arrived exactly when they said he would.  As the blockage was in the drains outside of the house the plumber arranged for a drainage specialist to come out within the hour and the specialist cleared the blockage within 20 minutes.  Well worth the monthly cost and gives me reassurance and peace of mind that if it happens again it can be easily fixed.,HomeServe
"Engineer was slightly early (a good thing for me) having rung first to give me  30 minutes notice, identified the problem quickly (leaking waste) and fitted a new replacement which he fully tested for leaks before leaving.",HomeServe
"Your plumber Lee was very friendly and helpful, identified the toilet cistern problem that was causing pipe rattle and quickly rectified it. I would whole-heartedly recommend Homeserve.",HomeServe
"Great job, plumber new exactly what the problem was and sorted it out without any issues.",HomeServe
The speed at which an engineer came out to repair my toilet,HomeServe
"Plumber phoned me beforehand (very important), arrived on time and completed what I thought would be a difficult task (replacing old seized taps - I provided the new ones) in short order. Very pleasant and efficient.",HomeServe
Good experience. Plumber knowledgeable repairs carried out without any fuss. Polite and friendly.,HomeServe
The leaking radiator was fixed.,HomeServe
The engineer was polite and assessed the drainage problem immediately - it was sorted very quickly and cleanly.,HomeServe
"Easy to arrange the appointment.Plumber arrived within booked time slot and dealt with the leak. Job done, no problem",HomeServe
"Had a broken tap - called HomeServe who confirmed it was covered under my policy and the engineer was booked - no problem- Tom the engineer arrived on time and was polite, helpful and professional. The tap was replaced and all left working, clean and tidy thanks for the great service",HomeServe
They did a great job fixing a split pipe under my driveway. Done the work very quick.,HomeServe
"All your telephone personnel were very helpful. I heard water running in my downstairs toilet on Sunday 14th January, a plumber visited on16th. He could hear the leak but could not fix it because I needed leak detection. A second plumber visited on the18th, located the leak, removed some tiles and floorboards to carry out the repair. Around lunchtime on the 21st I noticed one of the new connectors dripping, by 6pm the water was a torrent. I had to phone again to arrange another urgent repair. A different plumber visited on the 23rd and repaired it. I asked what was the problem and he said I would go mad because the water was coming from one of the new connectors that had not been fitted properly Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€“The cold water supply had to be turned off each time. This was hard for me because I had to go under the stairs every time. I only turned it back on for minutes to fill the kettle and jugs.I am still drying out the void under my floorboards because of the volume of water that escaped.The situation was stressful enough without the repair not being mended on the first attempt.",HomeServe
"Had a panic recently on a Sunday, accidentally knocked a radar off the wall, water flooded my kitchen.  I called Home Serve and a plumber came out that night and sorted it out.  The flooding caused my wall sockets to trip and I couldn't reset them. Another call to Home Serve and an engineer came out within 48 hours (had to wait for everything to dry out first)Exceptional service from the telephone operator to the workmen. Left no mess and were very polite. Well done Home Serve",HomeServe
"Plumber was on time, courteous and reassuring, he understood I was anxious and explained what the problem was and where the leak was coming from. Very happy with the service. Thanks",HomeServe
Very swift service to help with a leak. Professional and helpful technician- thank you,HomeServe
Homeserve man was very good found the leak in the garden quickly and repaired it in a couple of hours.,HomeServe
Unfortunately I had a bad experience with Homeserve.  I had water coming through my ceiling into the kitchen downstairs.  Homeserve came out and  cut two holes in my ceiling looking for the leak and said itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big job and would come back. Then another engineer came back days later and wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch the leak as she said it was on a pipe that had been fixed before and that is what could have caused the leak.   So Homeserve left me with two holes in my ceiling with no intention of doing/fixing anything.   I had to pay for a  reputable plumber to fix the leak who just took up the floorboards from above the leak and sorted it so not needing to take the ceiling apart or causing any more damage.  Homeserve were not interested in reimbursing me for the damage they caused to my ceiling and I have now had to pay out to replace that too.  An expensive time for me.  Needless to say I cancelled my Policy with Homeserve never to return.,HomeServe
What should have been quite a simple replacing of a part turned out to be a whole replacement of the toilet. The engineer didn't quibble at all and returned within a few days to do the job. I  was very pleased with the outcome and the efficiency of your engineer.However I don't rate your booking via the automated phone call. I asked for a repair to my leaking toilet and someone was sent to unblock it. It was a wasted journey and a waste of my time as it was the blockage engineer who was sent and not the repair engineer.Apart from that I had first rate service. Thank you.,HomeServe
"Mixed experience with HomeServe. They have been easy to use and make appointments however a mixed experience when it comes to actual repairs. The first call out was brilliant, the plumber went above and beyond to resolve our issue, couldn't thank him enough. However since this it has been pretty poor. We called a plumber out with an issue with our toilet, after he left this repair did not hold and we had to call someone out again. The 2nd plumber came, looked at it, wiggled something about, told my partner this probably won't fix it but its too much work for now so call in when it stops working again. It stopped working again almost immediately. Is wasting our water and money and is a nuisance to book more time off for the same problem. I feel that is a pretty poor service.",HomeServe
The service at the administrative end is fast and efficient. The plumber who came to my house was surly and rude. His technical skills were fine but I would not want to have him do any work for me ever again.,HomeServe
"the plumber arrived when expected, knew immediately what the problem was and did the necessary work. He was pleasant and professional. Thank you for the good service.",HomeServe
Immediate response and visit. Leak detected and repaired. Friendly and efficient plumber,HomeServe
Quick response and referral followed up promptly for a 2nd drainage expert. Unfortunately there was no solution so we are no further forward other than knowing the external drains are fine. No follow up or next steps offered but we still have the intermittent smell in our kitchen and sometimes throughout the house. Where do we go from here?,HomeServe
"Plumber did a comprehensive job , tidying up afterwards and taking all rubbish away",HomeServe
"a plumbing ieak behind the sink,engineer booked 5 days later,stayed in all day phoned late afternoon to delay till next day.engineer thought it was a drain problem once problem explained fully engineer sorted very quickly and pleasantly.engineer was brilliant.but the rest was soso thats why only 3 stars,good job it was only a small leak,didnt do the wood tiles a lot of good",HomeServe
Very prompt response and rectification of leaking toilet,HomeServe
"Instant action, helpful advice which enabled me to temporarily staunch the flow until the engineer appeared and did the job professionally. Excellent!",HomeServe
Engineer arrived on time he called in advance to confirm arrival time.  After replacing a valve cleared and tidied away.  Very polite too .,HomeServe
"Slight hiccup with first visit to sort our blocked sink & loo but call back was actioned immediately & the result is fantastic!! Great service, highly recommended!!",HomeServe
I had to call many times to arrange an emergency visit at my property. There were 3 holes in bathroom tap pipe. They arranged an emergency visit but no one arrived. When I called them they told me that that engineer went somewhere else. There was no other person available till next morning. During night the water leaked through the ceiling to kitchen cabinet.,HomeServe
"Arrived within the time frame. Plumber very polite, clean and professional. Completed the work in short time with no mess and advised on how to prevent the problem reoccurring. Excellent service by all concerned through out the problem.",HomeServe
What great service. The plumber who attended was such a pleasant polite and cheerful chap who dealt with the problem in a very professional competent manner. It would be a pleasure to see him again if we needed a plumber in the future.,HomeServe
The response to our blocked drain was very fast. It was quite serious and so contractors had to be called in. Their response time was very good and the whole job was complete within a  few hours.Everyone was extremely helpful and professional  making the otherwise difficult experience  very easy and stress free.,HomeServe
I have been with Homeserve for several years and have always found them very supportive. Unlike other providers they provide maintenance as well as emergency cover and do not quibble over how many toilets you have if for example there is a problem with only one. I have just renewed my plumbing and drainage cover and plan to extend this to boiler and heating.,HomeServe

The plumber went beyond the initial problem and found a future problem too.,HomeServe
The first engineer from witham came in and unblocked my sink although I did mention that I thought the problem was outside as the washing machine had thrown back water . He then proceeded to phone his boss and said that someone would be in touch that afternoon . No one rang so I waited till the next day I rang homeserve to query what was happening with my case and they did not have any idea that I was still waiting to be completed and said that a drainage engineer would contact me . I waited all weekend phoned again Monday and was told that the earliest appointment they could get me was Thursday I accepted ( I understand that you are busy so why didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they say sorry sir the earliest is Thursday the first time IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have been upset but would have accepted it ) the engineer came on Thursday was brilliant  and polite cleared the drain with no problem . I do wish the office was up front and kept us  informed. The Engineering service was great but the customer ( human ) service was poor,HomeServe
"Plumber arrived on time , saw leaked replaced pipe quick and neat work",HomeServe
"Your plumber (I think his name was Kieron) was excellent. I was unimpressed by the mechanical voice that I got when I first rang. Then after saying we had no water, we were sent an engineer!! Crazy.",HomeServe

"The plumber who came was excellent. He arrived within the time booked, was polite, helpful, very knowledgeable and worked very efficiently on the problem I had. He also gave me some advice which I really appreciated.Organising the visit was easy but it was several days before I could get a a slot for someone to attend and that's why I dropped a star.",HomeServe

"I was attracted by advertisement on newspaper to choose HomeServe's policy on Plumbing and Drainage Plus at Ã‚Â£0.5/month.  So far I have made 2 claims: one to repair the toilet flushing system, and another to repair a leaking sink-tap.  I am very satisfied with the excellent service provided by the staff at telephone reception and two well-experienced and efficient engineers (Daniel and Toby).",HomeServe
Although the engineer has been twice there is still a leak under the sink. Have asked for another engineer to visit next time.,HomeServe
I had an a very good 1st appointment. The engineer came from a far way to attend the appointment. He rang me an hr before to give me an aprox time. He arrived earlier. He asked me if I was ok for him to do the job now as he discovered the leak was under the concrete floor. He fixed the leak cleaned up and explained everything to me.,HomeServe
"Contacted homeserve re:a water leak, a plumber was booked for the earliest available date, the leak was on a shower waste, the plumber arrived at the specified time slot and promptly replaced the shower trap, good service throughout. My only criticism is the time allocated was for all day, surely homeserve can tell you if it would be a morning/afternoon slot, to avoid waiting in all day",HomeServe
"Yes, response was prompt and leak was stopped. Very reliable service. Easy to book and arrange appointment.",HomeServe
The person that came out to fix my toilet helped me with my Drains. Even though it wasn't his job and I only had one toilet. He went the extra mile for me gave 101% to the job and unblocked my Drains. Friendly and polite.,HomeServe

They were on time and unblocked in a matter of minutes,HomeServe

The appointment was not met and I had to chase up a new appointment from a chat agent called Liam, this time the appointment was met.The plumber arrived on time and carried out an excellent service which solved the problem.",HomeServe
A prompt response by HomeServe to a drainage/blockage issue that could have spiralled out of control has helped. Thank you.,HomeServe

The Plummer visited the day after I reported the problem.  Wow!  He arrived during time period specified.  Wow again!  The problem was not run of the mill and he had to adapt the system to effect a repair.  To this end he visited Screwfix for appropriate parts.  What a clever guy.  To say that we were blown away is an understatement!,HomeServe
Sorry I was just very upset about paying for insurance that was not what I asked for. Yes youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re man did stop the leak,HomeServe
Outstanding service from home serve.Had this policy for a few years now and forgot all about it.Anglia water advised we had a leak and we got a local plumber in who dealt with a leaking toilet. Got another letter and phoned AW who said still leaking and it was probably the ball valve in the attic tank.Hubby asked what we were paying HS for and I got out the policy and phoned them. Great communication from the agent who explained we were covered and he fixed plumber for next day. I also asked about we were covered for and was astonished at the cover. I queried the boiler cover as we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one . We are all electric. He passed me to another agent to review my policy. This agent was also excellent and worked out if we downgraded the cover we would pay more as we are on an older deal. The plumber arrived and went straight to the attic removed the ball cock which had stuck due to lime scale . Checked the outside meter to see further signs of leakage. Phoned AW few days later and leak sorted. Thank you to the team,HomeServe
The leaking tap was not properly fixed,HomeServe
We reported a blocked sink and plumber was sent who said he was unable to do anything. He requested a drainage contractor who came 2 days later and did excellent job.  Would have been 5 star review if correct contractor sent in the first place.,HomeServe
"The plumber arrived on time and was very professional and done excellent job on replacing the old taps on my cast iron bath, and left everything clean and tidy.",HomeServe
I had kitchen sink that was blocked. The engineer resolved quickly and efficientlyWith Karcher wet and dry vacuum. Sink now flowing nicely. 4 not 5 stars due to having had my booking postponed twice (think they are in demand and short-staffed)),HomeServe

I have the plumbing and drainage cover.  The first appointment was cancelled last minute and rearranged for the next day. I then got a call to cancel that one.  I complained and the call was reinstated.  The engineers who called were very good. The engineers do seem to cover a wide area. May be they have to spend too long travelling to fit all the calls in,HomeServe
"I raised a claim because my external tap would not shut off. The earliest appointment was 3 days wait.  The plumber  arrived as arranged but said he couldn't turn the water off at the internal stop tap and that the external stop tap also wouldn't work because it hadn't been touched for years even though he did not attempt to investigate. However he did reduce the water pressure by turning on the taps and he quickley fitted a new tap. Before he left he ajusted the water pressure at the internal stop tap. Unfortunately I then heard  water trickling onto the carpet, it was the internal stop tap.  I reported the issue and another plumber arrived 2 days on. He asked what the problem was and I told him the stop tap wasn't working and that it was leaking. He took a look and told me it just needed a 'Nip'  which took around 2 seconds and sure enough the leak was fixed. He turned the stop tap open and closed and said there was nothing wrong with it. However he did not test the water flo to show it had stopped. Later my husband tested the stop tap and it was not working.                                                                      Again I reported the issue and a 3rd plumber came. He was a very pleasant young man who had no issues at turning off the external stop tap and replacing the necessary parts to fix the problem. He was very professional, polite and friendly and even put covers over his shoes to prevent the carpet getting soiled.",HomeServe
"Numerous calls to sort out same issue of a blocked toilet various people came out saying different things, problem not resolved by homeserve, they are good for minor issues such as leaking tap which was replaced no issues but anything more complicated forget it, they only cover you for Ã‚Â£4K IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m out of pocket by almost Ã‚Â£8k following collapsed drains under house, complete devastation mess and upheaval before Xmas still in a mess now and still blocked toilets upstairs total nightmare Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¢",HomeServe

Repairing a short length of outside drainpipe31 - 01 - 24Mrs. D. BradshawThe engineer announced that he was in the vicinity and arrived on time.  He was tasked with repairing a short length of drainpipe from bathroom to over door canopy.  This pipe had previously been repaired by one of your engineers in December but had subsequently come away and fallen to the ground. The engineer made an assessment and checked whether it could be done from outside or whether he would have to work internally.  He decided it could be completed from outside.  He worked quickly and efficiently and the job was soon complete.  In addition to this he noticed a small repair which he could fix for me and for which I was very grateful.  He was friendly and polite and gave me the best of service for which I was very grateful.,HomeServe
"The engineers who came were helpful and friendly.  I was disappointed that the first appointment was cancelled, so was the second, on the third I was told would take 2 men so re-booked.Had expected a full replacement but in the end was only partial, although sufficient to solve immediate problem.Report had to be chased, and also had to chase rubble clearance.But overall I was glad to get it fixed.",HomeServe
"I would give a 5* but I had to wait 4 days for my appointment. If I had a young family it would have been really inconvenient not having a bath.

"This is my first experience with Homeserve.At first, the plumber who came initially did an ok job and recommended a drainage team to come have a look. However, that was declined.I called up and asked why only tobbe told he had closed the job. Thankfully, the person I spoke with booked in drain engineer to come have a look.The drain engineer was super great. Got to the bottom of the issue and did not have to look at the drainage at all. I forgot his name, I can't praise him enough for sorting the issue out. He also went above his job. He  advised me on how to sort my leaky front guttering before he left. In all, the drain engineer gave a superb service.",HomeServe
Outstanding service and advice from a very helpful and knowledgeable drainage engineer.,HomeServe
"First engineer diagnosed the fault said he would order the part and also said there was a leak and he would ask for another job to be raised for it to be fixed at the same time as fitting the new syphon.  I called back to organise the fitting of the new part and asked for the new job to be raised that the engineer had asked for to fix the leak. I was told all arranged.  The next engineer arrived didn't know anything about the leak and was just going to fit the part.  He didn't even know how to take the cistern lid off. He finally managed to fit it but it wasn't flushing properly.  He fiddled with and told me it was fine but I could hear from the way it was filling it wasn't.  So I called and lodged a complaint as although I was told a job had been raised for the leak it wasn't, plus the flush wasn't working properly.  I said I didn't want to see that engineer again as he obviously didn't know what he was doing.  I was told someone would call within 24 hours to arrange for a different company to come and fix the leak and sort out the flush, they didn't.  3rd engineer arrives the next day although I was not told he was coming and told me he had come to fix a part for the flush, but part was fitted the previous day, and he was on here to sort out the flush didn't know anything about the leak.  Flush easily sorted as the previous engineer had not turned the water on fully.  Another phone call to sort out the leak 4th engineer comes and finds that the new syphon had not been fitted correctly and in fact shouldn't have been fitted before the leak was fixed.  He however was very efficient sorted out the leak and had to put a completely new syphon and new push buttons in as well.  Problems with Claims Department who told me twice the job had been raised when it hadn't.  In the end it took three calls to get the leak fixed with each one assuring me the job had been raised.  Plus one inefficient plumber. At the least the other three knew what they were doing",HomeServe
Leak still not cured after two visits.Both the plumbers were very pleasant .,HomeServe
Great service. Proactive plumber and his conversations with the online Master Plumber identified the issue quickly. Parts ordered and fitted the next day. Really pleased. Thank you.,HomeServe
Booking an engineer was surprisingly quick and easy without the long  list of questions I was anticipating. The appointment was booked for the next working day. The engineer was professional and found a solution to the problem which I think would have challenged a less experienced plumber.,HomeServe
Prompt and efficient service and a first class plumber who completed the job. Friendly and nothing too much trouble approach Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸ÂÂ»,HomeServe
The man turned up and informed us it was a shared drain so there was nothing he could do and to report it to Thames Water which was fine. When I contacted the company to get my Excess charge back I was informed that they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refund it as the man had carried out some rodding. This was a total lie and I have raised a complaint.Updated after response.No inspection was made and no rodding was  carried out. He was in my house for 2 minutes of which 1.5 minutes was on a phone call. When I phoned about the Excess I was told his report mentioned him rodding. It did not happen. I understand how Excess works and he did nothing.,HomeServe
As I was satisfied with the HomeServe repair by their Plimber.,HomeServe

Homeserve were called in by Aviva when I made a claim for a leaking shower and subsequent water damage. It was their job to identify the cause of the leak and fix it. On 5 February first engineer came and identified the cause and needed to order a part and arranged to come back on 9 February and fit it. On 9 February no engineer came and I complained to Homeserve who sent a second engineer on 10 February. Second engineer missed the noon deadline to pick up the part because he was given the wrong address of a plumbers merchant that closed at noon on Saturdays. After hacking two holes in the ceiling below the shower he too found the cause of the leak and agreed with the first engineer but said (correctly) that it was a two man job. On Monday 12 February Engineers 3 and 4 arrived with the correct part. In order to fit it they needed to make another hole in the ceiling and finished the job in a couple of hours. The icing on this cake was receiving a satisfaction survey by text with any reply being charged at my standard network rate. So guys you want me to pay money in order to tell you how s h i t you are?,HomeServe
"Homeserve called out because of blocked drain, Your colleague arrived using rod cleared blockage. He did say it should be flushed to vcomplete the job but his equipment was broken.  Thus job not fully completed.",HomeServe

"After receiving a letter from SW water for plumbing and drainage plus, I decided to have a look today. The site was easy to understand and straight forward to follow instructions to set up an account.It would of been nice to have the option to pay the annual fee rather then just D/D but thats no drama. Also it could be better if half way through the form you didn't loose the already inputted information If leave to get bank details for example, as some cards don't hold certain details. So far so good will review again if use the services at any point.",HomeServe
"Unfortunately had to log an appointment with homeserve after water came up the drain on my driveway when the washing machine drained.A wonderful repair man ( Adam I think ) came out the next day. He quickly identified where the blockage was but the drain cover was under a block paving cover which was stuck as it hasn't been up in years. However,  he didn't give up, and I don't know how he managed to lift it out. Inside the drain was completely blocked with tree roots. Although it was a big job, he called back to base to be given the time to do the job properly. He managed to cut out and remove all the roots and washed everything down. He also checked that all drains and toilets were flushing through correctly.Amazing job..what a brilliant guy. Glad I signed up to homeserve.",HomeServe

"Plumber Adrian was efficient and helpful though the problem required an Engineer. We had to wait for four full days without water for Dean, the engineer, to attend. This was obviously inconvenient. Homeserve need more engineers as Dean has to cover a huge area of the country, hence our wait. He worked skilfully and tirelessly to solve our problem: very impressive.  However, as mentioned, the delay was, frankly, unacceptable from an ""emergency service."" We have awarded four stars because the personnel were so good but the system less so.",HomeServe

Told me how to stem the flow and arranged for a plumber to come out the next morning. ( it was now late evening). Plumber arrived 8am next morning (a Sunday) and quickly and without any fuss carried out a repair. Great service and can fully recommend. Thank you Homeserve. Great service.,HomeServe
"Plumber checked, everything left everything as it was very polite good service.",HomeServe
Excellent service. Guys were really polite and efficient. Came to unblock on the 2nd Jan 2024 and again to repair pipes on 16th Jan.,HomeServe
"The leak was at last located in the bathroom, it being the outlet pipe under toilet.  The first person could not find it and we had the worry of it being in some pipes above ceiling in the hall, necessitating the ceiling part having to be removed.  After an asbestos check on the ceiling, which was OK, 2 lads came last week and sorted it.  The relief is the ceiling is intact.  We are so grateful for it being sorted, and thank you all.",HomeServe
The plumber arrived on time and fixed the problem. He was pleasant and told me what he was doing and why .Job done!,HomeServe
"The service was prompt and good, although it was annoying that the information l spent a long time giving to Homeserve prior to the plumber calling, was not passed onto him!      This was important, as l was unable to be personally present (l had made arrangements for him to have access to my property) and l had to repeat it over the phone to the plumber when he arrived all over again!    I am also unhappy about the policy excess of Ã‚Â£30 each time l make a callout - this is in addition to the annual policy premium, so l will be researching an alternative plumbing emergency provider.Reply from HomeServe:""Thanks for taking the time to share a review Susan.While it's great to see you were happy with the engineer and his repair I am sorry that your information was not passed to him on this occasion.We try to be as clear and transparent as we possibly can within the terms and conditions regarding excess, the payment is taken before we attend and covers investigation work carried out. I'd like to apologise if this was unexpected. If you call us on 0330 0247 999 we'd be happy to take a look into the cover levels available to you.Amy from HOMESERVEHere To Help Team",HomeServe

"Two plumbers came to asses the problem of low water in the house I have but just gave advice to use a local plumber and home serve won't pay since the problem is caused by the limescale. Not very happy with this. They should sort it out for me whatever the solution is,  it just talk.",HomeServe
"Mark was great, he returned today to fit the replacement radiator.Pleasant and efficient.What I am slightly confused and annoyed about is, what am I paying my premiums for?I had a leaking radiator, the carpet is a bit of a mess, small area butÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.Mark came and did a good job, (hence the four stars) for which I paid a few hundred pounds, that I could ill afford.   My husband being in care.Is it worth continuing with you?!?I am considering my options.Sincerely Rachel Bolton",HomeServe

"I had a burst water pipe and another leak, so got home to water pouring through the ceiling, a flooded kitchen & no electric downstairs. It was late on a Sunday evening, so filled out details online & they rang me by 9.30am Monday. Came out the same afternoon & fixed both leaks. Can't fault the service or the speed in which      they dealt with it. The young man who came out was highly professional & had it sorted in less than an hour. Well worth having the policy.

All your tradesman did was tighten a connection to the leaking outside tap. 24hrs later the connection was leaking again.,HomeServe
A slow start but improved as time went on. Eventually the water leak was sorted (10 days).,HomeServe
Complained the time for each job had been reduced so determined my leek was inside the house but hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got the time to find it so went off to his other 3 calls for the day. Cancelled my contract.,HomeServe
I was very impressed by Mark who came to fix 3 water leaks we had on our property which was drastically impacting water pressure in the house. He was very communicative and clearly knew what he was doing. We are grateful to finally have good water pressure again!,HomeServe
"Rang Homeserve at 9pm on discovering water leak. Engineer came as promised the following morning andswiftly  diagnosed need for a new pressure cylinder, which was not covered by insurance.

Operative was very helpful and tried to unblock from bottom of downpipe but unable to do so. Someone else took 30 seconds to unblock from top and it is a shame that Homeserve are not allowed to operate from  ladders,HomeServe
"The plumber who came to fix the toilet was great and job was carried out quickly and efficiently thank you.  I usually give 5 stars but have marked down a bit this time as we were messed about a bit over appointments. We were given an appointment for Saturday evening and received a phone call that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t connect properly (wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure if it was Homeserve ) so I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hear what was being said.  It was to tell me that appointment had been changed to Tuesday, but I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t received any  text notification or had a chance to say if that appointment was convenient. I had to get this information by calling homeserve.",HomeServe

Easy to make an appointment for the engineer call-out. Engineer arrived on time. Could only offer complete new tap assembly; replacement cartridge not available from the van. Offer rejected (no match with other kitchen s/s silverware). Second visit arranged. Cartridge provided by customer fitted. Issue of dripping tap now resolved.,HomeServe
The engineer still did a temporary fix of my dual flush button.He brought in a new dual flush button to be fitted in my cistern.He struggled to fit this and finally used the old button with parts of new button. The full flush still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t function.This job took almost an hour.He was very nice and polite.,HomeServe
The information provided by HomeServe on what was covered was very clear and met my home needs.  The whole process of setting up the cover for Plumbing and Drainage was quick and easy.,HomeServe
Excellent response but 1st visit missed the main simple problem although they appeared to solve it. A further visit identified the fault as an original installation fault. I called in my plumber who said the fault was in the feed to the water tank. H/S returned; replaced all the pipes and after finding NO blockage then decided that the real problem was the original simple ball cock replacement,HomeServe

"Wish IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d taken cover out sooner - it cost me nearly Ã‚Â£1000 to have a drain cleared  of tree roots and repaired Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â‚¬Ã¯Â¸ÂSo I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate when I was offered this cover via my local water company.When by drain was overflowing, every time I had washer in, I rang.

"I was having problems with my central heating boiler and as it is a new boiler and still under warranty, British Gas sent an engineer out to fix it. This was done but the engineer pointed out that the reason was a blocked drain where the overflow pipe goes into. He freed it and got the boiler working but said it could happen again after heavy rain. Contacted Homeserve and they sent someone down straight away. He cleared the blockage (mud and silt), reinstated the brick paving round the drain an mortared round it. Quick, efficient and friendly",HomeServe
Home Serve advertise Drain repairs however they conveniently regret to inform on the Website the fact that it has many restrictions.  I have unfortunately paid Ã‚Â£30 extra twice as I  wanted the Semi detached 3 storey 3 flated house drains tested. I consider this to entirely misleading I pay a fixed sum 12 months of the year. For a service that does not reflect the basic facts.Worthless in my view. Any efficient plumber can fit a leaking tap shower etc Drans testing is entirely another enterity ALL IN ALL IN MY PERSONAL VIEW Home Serve is a total waste of money.,HomeServe
James came to find a leak and was amazing. He found the leak and sorted it straight away. Thank you.,HomeServe
Used the on-line booking service and manged to arrange a visit the next morning between 8am to 12pm The engineer arrived and replaced an isolation valve for the washing machine cold water feed. Left site all tidy. Took just 15 minutes to complete the job. Very well done.,HomeServe

"We were in a panic as we realised water from the kitchen and bathroom waste was somehow bypassing the grid and finding its way down the terraced garden into our fish pond. Homeserve sent an engineer the same day who was extremely quick in identifying the fault. I was so glad that I had taken plumbing and drainage cover some years ago. The engineer rectified the problem which needed a new gulley, He fitted it and repaired the flagging which he had lifted to access the interior of the grid.",HomeServe
"Good, engineer repaired issue in a professional wayBad, time taken for engineer to attend, just under 2 days, delayed by 8 hours due to being called on emergency work. Homeserve did not consider having no water at all on the property an emergency",HomeServe

made appoint on line which was quick and easy and the plumber solved the issue without any fuss.,HomeServe
"I recently had an engineer visit my home to replace a broken drain. The new drain was fitted in the wrong place and water was escaping at the back and soaking into the wall and surrounding area. The engineer returned to rectify the problem (which he sort of did) but left the drainpipe hanging away for the wall (and not able to be fixed back to the wall with the drain been too far forward) and the drain cover with a large hole in it, so debris was able to fall into the drain. I have had to fix the problem myself, really not the purpose of getting a company to fix the problem!!",HomeServe
"Well worth the premium I pay each month, very professional plumber who worked most of the afternoon and fixed all the water leaks.",HomeServe
"A plumbing engineer was booked for yesterday 20th Feb 2024, an ongoing appointment from last week 9th Feb but nobody came plus no phone call to explain why!? Phoned you today 21st Feb to ask why this happened?Have now got to wait another week before another engineer can come & hopefully turn up this time! Not very happy with the service from ""HomeServe"". Another insult to injury our new policy has arrived for the next year wanting an extra Ã‚Â£128.16 !!!?? Not exactly a recommendation is it.?",HomeServe
"We rang about a leak and somebody came the following day which was brilliant. However, after that we waited in the next day nobody came the day after that somebody came with the wrong equipment so couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do. It waited in the day after that for somebody else to not come the day, after that, somebody came, still not with the right equipment! Then they were booked in to come a few days later and knew exactly what they needed and what they had to do, but we got a phone call to say they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t coming because yet again they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the right equipment! So now IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to wait in another day for them not to turn up probably so all in all this service was quite disgraceful.",HomeServe
Plumber was excellent. Rang before arriving. Good job. Downside. Toilet broke Tuesday evening rang first thing Wednesday.  Homeserve rang  Wednesday lunchtime to say earliest appointment Friday between 8 o'clock and 1 o'clock.  He came after 12 o'clock as arranged on Friday.  However for the price of insurance and 30 pounds call out. Expect quicker service,HomeServe
Excellent service from homeserveOnce I rung them with my problem of a blocked drain they promptly sent someone round to resolve matters. ,HomeServe
"Very professional and friendly customer services and a plumber arrived the next day , wonderful service.",HomeServe
I had a leak in my toilet from water pipes. Rang them log a claim and paid excess. Engineer turned up and said they wouldn't do anything about it. Because the fitting is non uk. It didn't make sense.And they didn't do anything and took my excess free.  I can't remember the exact date but it was last year sometime ,HomeServe
Sorted my blocked drain with no issues. So glad I had cover or would have cost a fortune.  ,HomeServe

I booked an engineer on Monday for today from 8 to 1 he phoned at 7 30 very early asking what the problem was and he would be arriving in one hour.   There was a leak under the shower that had come through the ceiling in the kitchen which I explained to him.  He ran the shower then decided to look through ceiling in kitchen the drill and probe werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t charged so had to do that first then went upstairs and I found him on his mobile phone he then accused me of following him around. Very unprofessional did find leak in shower eventually but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to want to do the job.,HomeServe

"We had a blocked toilet toilet on the Tuesday the 13th Feb and it didn't get cleared till the Sat 17th Feb. On the first call we where told this was seen as an urgent job because of only having one toilet in the home and having children, but 5 days is not what we class as a good service.We had various Plummers and drainage people come see the problem. We were constantly calling as we were given no updates and at one point we were told the job hadn't been passed on to the right department.  We were also asked to pay twice. I am now looking for a full refund and compensation for the stress that was coursed. Can this please be sorted ASAP ? ",HomeServe
"Plumber was capable and did all he could within HomeserveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parameters. Sadly, those parameters would not allow for certain replacements and the attending plumber could therefore only Ã¢â‚¬Å“bodgeÃ¢â‚¬Â my issue. I am left with an unsightly workaround and will certainly consider renewal closely.",HomeServe
Plumber came on time. Very nice man. Did the job quickly and efficiently. ,HomeServe

"Staff on phone were always helpful, initial visit was quick and engineer helpful but then took 2 weeks for following visits as wrong person sent out twice. One visit cancelled and rebooked but I was not informed. Checks were thorough when carried out though was told different reasons for flooding in cellar- last engineer did camera to check the drainage pipe at rear of property and no cracks detected. He advised is more likely to be contaminated groundwater due to possibly broken pipe in road or neighbour further up the hill- so sudden problem of water in cellar remains unsolved and problematic. Southern Water checked shared drain at house but will not be checking the rest of the road.",HomeServe

As he was unable to rectify the issue,  I had to contact Anglian Water who eventually cleared the problem. This whole problem took 3 days to resolve, not ideal when my wife who was recently discharged from hospital and had mobility issues.",HomeServe

All the technicians, as well as the management and admin staff, were polite and demonstrated a very high degree of care and professionalism. ",HomeServe
"Been with homeserve for about 5 years. Covered for everything pipework but not boiler. Made claim 2 years ago when pressure dropping on boiler. Homeserve sent plumbers out to check heating system radiators and pipe work, no quibble. Found a leaking joint under my home and fixed it. However 2 years on same thing happening again. Phoned HS. Completely different story. Just kept saying I am not covered because I don't have boiler cover (i am ALL pipework beyond tails leading to boiler covered). I told them my boiler was services 2 weeks earlier and no problems found. They insisted that my boiler would need checking before they do anything. Then tried to upsell me on them sending an engineer first. This would have been at least Ã‚Â£80. However I said I wasn't happy about this. What was wrong with them coming out an ruling out the pipework then me going back to my engineer. They wouldn't do that....even though 2 years earlier they came out with no quibble. So I got my engineer back who checked thoroughly costing me Ã‚Â£50. As suspected nothing wrong with boiler. So called HS again. They still tried to insist I wasn't covered. Trying every gaslighting trick in the book to convince me. I dug my heels in and insisted they send someone to check. Had to ask the agent to log a complaint about his stubborn attitude to get him to send someone. Sure enough when the 2 man team arrived they found a leak on pipework. They complained from start to finish about checking under my home (5ft drop so easy enough access) quoting health and safety that beggered belief. Then complained about how hard the pipe would be to fix. However fixed it but damaged the pipe leading to boiler because they had been heavy handed fixing the leak. Told me they couldn't  touch the boiler so sent a boiler engineer out to fix it the next day. Engineer  came out fixed the boiler. Job done. 2 days on pressure dropping again. I checked their work and found that the original work they had done was leaking. Called HS again took days to send someone out. Stayed in between 8am to 6pm no one turned up and no call to say why. Phoned HS again told engineer would be here between 8am and 1pm. Same again no arrival no call. Phoned HS yet again. This time told I wasn't covered because my boiler isn't on policy. Had to go through whole scenario AGAIN. They then realised that they were fixing there own bad workmanship so came out and fixed it. Now 2 weeks on no word on the initial complaint I made. I will be following up. Upshot 2 years ago this was a good company but was told by the last engineer that HS had been bought out by an American company. Obviously from my experience they have a policy of discouraging claims wherever possible. If someone with less resolve as myself had tried to make a claim they would have taken HS at there word and failed get work done that they were covered for or paid an upsell fee to HS that they needn't have done. As of today 21st March over 2 months after initial logged complaint. This company still has not contacted me to follow up except for 1 letter a week ago saying they are still looking into it. This is now nearly 2 weeks beyond their maximum time to reply. Such a bad company now.",HomeServe
the engineer who came out to fit my new tap as the old one was leaking could'nt do enough for me he was so polite and caring would not leave until he was satisfied everything was working although it was nearly his finish time for the day he cracked on until job done,HomeServe
a quick response on the phone plumber did the job well and quick,HomeServe
The young man came and identified my shower leak and supplied the part to repair it and was done and gone within half an hour with minimum disruption to the bathroom.,HomeServe
"Utterly useless! I have a blocked drain causing our kitchen sink and dishwasher to be un-usable currently. I maid a claim on the 13th Feb 24, and a plumber was sent out on the 16th. He tried to plunge the sink but told me it would most likely be the gully and he would need to re-book for a drainage engineer. Drainage engineer came on 19th and said he thought it was not the gully but somewhere in between and needed a snake to clear it, but didn't have the equipment, so had to book another plumber to come back to do it. Plumber came on the 20th and snaked the drain but said it was the gully that was blocked and needed to re-book with drainage engineer again!.Engineer was supposed to arrive on the 22nd but Homeserve txt me at 5pm on the day to tell me they were not coming and that it had been re-booked for the 28th! I rang Homeserve and told them I needed someone sooner as I had been waiting a week already. They re-booked for 23rd. I received no confirmation message so I called at 8am on the 23rd to confirm it was booked in. Homeserve confirmed it was booked in and they would have all the equipment. I got a call today (23rd) at 2pm to once again tell me no drainage engineer would be coming.As you can imagine I was getting pressy pissed off with Heomserve by this point. I asked for someone to be sent out again and they refused. i asked to speak to a manger, they told be no-one was available. I asked to make a complaint, they asked me why? WHY? Why do you think!? I eventually asked to speak to accounts to cancel my account and to get a refund on my annual cover. Whether I get that or not is up in the air, but I will not be using Homeserve again, and I suggest you do not either. Happy to take your money monthly for call out service, but can't provide anyone when you need them.I called a local drainage serves (as I still have a blockage that needs fixing) and they said they could be here in 45 minutes. Here's hoping we are back in business in a few hours.UPDATE:Had to pay Ã‚Â£270 for the local plumber, but the problem has been sorted. Easy when people do what they say they are going to do. Support local business.",HomeServe
"Contacted HomeServe UK in the morning,and by the afternoon a man arrived,asked what the problem was and quickly got too work sorting the blockage.The man was very freindly and kept us informed at all times,within 45 minutes were back in buisness.Fist class service and would recomond to family and friends.",HomeServe

"Kitchen TapI was very worried about my kitchen tap, which had become extremely wobbly.  I phoned Home Serve, who were very understanding and arranged for an engineer to come out the same day.

"Raw sewage flooding from manhole in garden into back garden and lawn and neighbouring properties on Wednesday. Homeserve refused to declare this an emergency until we called out United Utilities on the Friday and they spoke with Homeserve. We were promised a water tanker for the next day, Saturday, but it didn't arrive. Nobody at Homeserve can explain why it was cancelled.  We are now promised a tanker and an engineer on Monday even tho this is now considered an emergency. In short the 'service' has been worse than abysmal and as is usual there is no accountability!",HomeServe
"Issue: Bad smell coming from shower cubicle drainage ouletAfter trying to resolve issue by using off the shelf drain blocker products, decided to use my protection plan with Homeserve for the first time.Engineer contacted me 15 mins before arrival as promised. Upon arrival, he asked if I would prefer he used boot covers...good start.He proceeded to investigate issue and to get a second opinion (rather than making an assumption as to the root cause of the problem) he had no issues in contacting his supervisor.  He then proceeded to fix the problem by replacing a damaged oulet part (having to pop to a local part store to obtain the correct part).  Once fitted, he tidied up accordingly and explained the job was guaranteed for 12 months, just in case the fix didnt resolve the problem.  Fortunately, to date, I have had no further problems.Overall the engineer was very professional and actually appeared to take pride in doing his job to the best of his abilities.",HomeServe
"I had booked appointment with this company to my clloged bathroom. Appointment should be in the slot between 8 am to 2 pm .At 12.15 I've got phone call that it will be delay and now I am in the slot between 2 pm and 6pm .

When I finished this call I have voice mail left from the engineer that he will not be able to come to me today and happy to book me on Monday!!!!!. I would like add that I am full time working parent not having time durring the week . What if I tkae day off today to be at home ??? Who will pay for it. Totally disrespectful to customers and customer time!!!!!!",HomeServe
 Very professional pleasantplumber who knew what to do and did the repair. Contacted me to say when they would be arriving and was within this timescale. Thank you.,HomeServe
"Shortly after taking advantage of a greatly reduced HomeServe insurance offer we noticed a problem with our toilet water syphoning away. A call was made to HomeServe and they agreed to send out their engineers. They arrived as agreed and resolved the issue but found further problems. Another two visits were arranged over a period of about six weeks and some serious drainage work was undertaken. This work was arranged by HomeServe and successfully completed by their engineers. At no time during this period did Homeserve attempt to avoid their commitments or expect us to compromise in any form or fashion. They did what they claimed they would when we took out the policy and deserve a well earned pat on the back. As an insurance company they are a credit to their selves and a lesson that many other companies, from the same industry, could and should learn from.   Well done HomeServe and many thanks.",HomeServe
"Very easy to make a claim and book an appointment. The man who visited to property was on time, polite and efficient. Only problem is that the replacement tap is nothing like the one I had. Mine was a stylish, soft flow tap and the replacement is more like you'd find in a public loo. But at least it's not leaking!",HomeServe
I reported my problem in the morning told them i had no water and a plumber was there in 4 hrs very quick  attendance.,HomeServe
It was very easy to take out plumbing insurance on the HomeServe website.,HomeServe

I called Homeserve out under my contract as I had a leaking tap.

This company has to be the worst company IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve dealt with this is my second complaint! Firstly regarding the first plumber advising what he advised we have done and the smell hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gone. The second plumber came and never recorded his notes with what he actually told us! Waited for another plumber who I nipped out and must have missed IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m absolutely sick to death chasing about a complaint! IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve then rang today to get advise whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been going on months and the phone went down and nobody has even rang back!!! This complaint has gone on a few months and nothing resolved because to me it seems they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to resolve it!!!! I would highly recommend going with a different company also when IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done a complaint on here before I got advised someone would call and they still havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t! ,HomeServe
guys came and sorted the problem which in the end  turned out to be  a worn washer on the cold water feed to tank in loft.,HomeServe
Helpfull yong man fixed my toilet and loft watertancs         overflow problem,HomeServe
I was very disappointed with this plumbers visit. There was a leak from under the shower but he said that it was just a case that silicone needed putting on the outside of the shower and that might well have been part of the problem but water was also travelling through the adjoining wall into the living room and the plaster was wet and blistering. He didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have any silicone so advised I get some as he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have on his van.I have been thinking for sometime of ending my contract with you but now I have done that. I would like to thank you for your support over the years but its getting too expensive now .,HomeServe
"The plumber came at my requested time, and solved the problem of a blocked outside drain promptly. He was efficient and courteous.",HomeServe
The introductory low price cover is the economical way of getting covered for any unexpected leaks.,HomeServe

Woke up next morning with cellar flooded had to tightens some of fittings my self,HomeServe
The drainage engineerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job was quick and great.  There was another job to be done as there is not enough water filling into the toilet system to flush enough. But he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it as he said it was a plumberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job. Anyway the engineer did a fantastic job. Wish I got a plumber as well with him!,HomeServe
"I didn't know whether I could claim for the leak behind the toilet, once logged on I was able to have an emergency engineer come to the house. He was very respectful with the house and going through the house with feet covers on. He knew exactly what to do and was courteous and friendly and was informative to what work has been done. This has saved me lot of money being able to use this service and am now able to sleep better knowing this has been rectified.",HomeServe
Rang about an outside blocked drain. They were extremely helpful and somebody came out within 3 hours from the call time and cleared the blockage within minutes. Highly recommend ,HomeServe
It was so simple to  book an appointment.The engineer turned up on time and cleared the blockage quickly without fuss.An excellent service. ,HomeServe
The guy turned up at 10.45pm but did let me know he was going to be late. Unfortunately for him the problem had resolved itself so he had a wasted journey. I'd managed to unblock the loo myself but didn't realise it. Still cost me Ã‚Â£30 call out. ,HomeServe
Had a leak in toilet from stop 3 work men came out on different days. And then the last worker came his name was Jeff and he was one who fixed it and stayed till job was done ,HomeServe
Great service. Plumber came on time and managed to also get a drainage specialist to help diagnose the problem. Blockage cleared but advised that installation was incorrect and should be looked at.,HomeServe
"Quick service engineer was out within a few days of reporting it. Engineer was polite, pleasant and explained what was needed to fix the tap ",HomeServe
I have not been impressed the last three occasions. An overflow pipe that was leaking had to have someone out twice because not fixed first time. Then had a toilet that was not always flushing. Came out 'fixed' it. Better than it was but not fully fixed and Working. About a month ago had a dripping tap and the other tap was not working. Still have a drippy tap. For what I pay a year they are not great.,HomeServe
"Putting in a claim was fast and hassle free. They were quick to answer the phone, I was given a booking in date for the repair within 3 days (drain unblocking) and the engineer rang before arriving. All in all a pleasant experience. I have been given sufficient notice to either renew or cancel my emergency cover so I was not left in the dark. I would recommend Homeserve for this type of cover.

Wasted paying Ã‚Â£30 excess to be told although I had a leak coming through my extracter fan wasn't a plumbing issue. Chap was really nice and apologetic but hasn't resolved my problem. To be honest I thought I was paying for an all in service. Obviously not,HomeServe

I was told 3 times on the phone that an engineer would completely replace my seized taps but he said they are not allowed so he just put tap topers on which do not match the rest of the taps and i paid Ã‚Â£30 excess. Disgusting service! Only the tops were replaced so it looks rediculous ,HomeServe

I liked the ease of booking an engineer to come out.  By the time he did get here (having been passed around various people) the problem had stopped and the plumber could not source the issue in the house.  So in my mind this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resolved yet.,HomeServe
"Whilst the outstanding small leaks on various compression joints took five visits to fix (they were difficult to stop), Callum from Burton-Smith stuck with the problems and worked hard and he has now fixed them all - much to my relief!Callum was always polite, unhurried, reassuring, smartly dressed, helpful and a tidy workman.

"We recently called for Homeserve to remedy a blocked drain. Sewage was backing into our shower as was the toilet. The call was made on a Sunday - we were informed that the technician would call the following Tuesday morning. On the Monday evening we received a call from HS to say that they would not be attending the morning slot (8:00 - 12:00) but would be attending in the afternoon between 13:00 and 18:00. I explained that there was significant health and safety issue in relation to the sewage backing up into the shower and the toilet but this fell on deaf ears.  Reluctantly I accepted the deferred appointment. On the Tuesday lunch time HS called again to state that they would not be attending. I again stated the health and safety issue and that we had plans the following day that would be scuppered. None of this had any affect. The issue was finally resolved on the Wednesday. The technician was very helpful and stated that they could not understand why we had had to wait so long. I lodged a complaint with Home Serve. They responded today and offered Ã‚Â£50 ""compensation"". I responded and listed the following issues;1 Health and Safety - sewage backing into our downstairs living space, inability to use the shower and toilet or use the kitchen sink or dish washer2 The loss of 8 hours on the Tuesday and a cancelled appointment in the afternoon.3 The loss of a day out as we had to wait in a further day for HS.Having heard all of the above Homeserve revised their offer Ã‚Â£75. There is no recognition of the issues we encountered. It really looks like HS customer services are in the business of mitigating their failings and passing the buck back to their customers.",HomeServe

Had a blocked drain and HS sent an engineer within 48hrs to fix it. They did a good job. Dropped a star because HSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s App could be more user friendly when it comes to organising a call out. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend. ,HomeServe

I was told the tap was unrepairable, and immediately I thought more expense buying a new tap.

"On discovering a seep from the foul pipe on our toilet, I called the Homeserve automated system.  I was immediately able to report the problem and arrange a visit within two days.  This was acceptable as I was asked if there was damage to my house, which there was not, so not an emergency.  Dan the plumber phoned on the day as promised and arrived promptly.  He was sympathetic and helpful, assessed the problem and managed to fix it in one hour.  He wore overshoes to protect my carpets.  He reassured me regarding the cold feed and flush from the cistern and rechecked all before leaving.  All in all, this was a first class service which took all the worry away from myself.  Well worth the  monthly cost and excess when I still have most of my annual insurance to run.  I would recommend plumbing cover to anyone like me in later years, who is no longer really able to fix things themselves at home.  Excellent! ",HomeServe

Engineer visit booked for 12.00-18.00 the day after my call to log a problem. The engineer arrived at 19.00 and duly replaced the damaged outside tap (in the dark using his torch to fix up the tap!). Excellent service albeit a bit later than planned. Well done!,HomeServe
Great service came out to look at a dripping Kitchen tap and replaced it with new and installed a couple of isolating valves as well for future. ,HomeServe
They did a great job when the eventually arrived. That was the problem. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a block drain on a weekend. After paying the money donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect them to turn up straight away. Make sure you plan the blockage before it happens.,HomeServe

The following day the leak began again but stronger, meaning we could not use the toilet. 2 days after reporting the issue it was repaired to our satisfaction.",HomeServe
"An appointment had been arranged for an engineer to repair my toilet on February 9th. I had about 4 phone calls asking me where I lived and directions, but I never got a clear answer.  About 4 oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢clock a supervisor phoned to apologise and other arrangement would be organised. Noting happened. I phoned and was told that an engineer would be with me before 10.00. Nobody came. I phoned just after 7.00 am on Saturday 10th February. An engineer was arranged for after 12 noon. He arrived at 12.05pm and completed the repair expertly. Since then I have received a letter dated16th February Complaint Ref No. CMP254115 delivered 23rd February. The letter was sympathetic to my complaint, and said somebody would discuss my complaint. Nobody has. Now an email asking to fill in a review HOW DID WE DO. APPALIINGLY IS THE ANSWER",HomeServe

I needed a weekend appointment and that was no problem. I had an issue with bath taps, new ones on and no questions asked. This is one insurance policy  I am happy to pay. ",HomeServe
"Initial reporting of fault over the telephone went well and respondent was very helpful in arranging a plumber to visit the next day. However, the plumber caused another issue when repairing the hose under the sink. When he moved the washing machine to fix the hose, the power cable was pulled out which stopped the washing machine from working. He was alerted to this but said 'I don't do electrics' and left us to call out a British Gas Home Care electrician to fix it. His attitude was a disgrace and on this occasion I'm less than happy that I was left without a working washing machine (which wasn't even the original fault) and with the service from Home Serve.",HomeServe
The place was left in a state and water refill from my mains. ,HomeServe
Plumber sorted the problem quickly.,HomeServe
Quick to come to home the very next day on a Sunday after we had a burst pipe in the middle of the night.,HomeServe

Sheila not as at the beginning of this correspondence!The engineer who came on the same day as I telephoned to report a leak, was pleasant, friendly and helpful.

"We had a leak from the tank overflow in the loft and Homeserve attended within a couple of days having established that water was not leaking into the house, thus enabling a cost effective response. When the plumber arrived he came equipped with a new ballcock when he could easily have just replaced a washer costing pence. I would have preferred however to have spoken on the phone with a real person rather than a robot. Many thanks",HomeServe
Not the most straightforward of challenges but all work completed without any fuss. We had a collapsed sewer which has been successfully restored. ,HomeServe

"I had a toilet that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flushing properly so called Homeserve to fix it, as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a customer for some years. First guy was very nice but his fix didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t last long and I called them again and next guy changed some things in the cistern, which seemed ok for a while. I had health problems so couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deal with anything for a while, but the cistern was constantly releasing water into the toilet and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on a water meter so it was costing me money on water bills. Once I felt better I called them again and this time the man who came changed the complete system and now my toilet is working perfectly Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shame they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do this on first visit.",HomeServe

Very helpful gentleman who came to unblock our drain. WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rest until it was clear and even helped me find and uncover the manhole we needed which was hiding in the garden! ,HomeServe
I have been without a working toilet for nearly three days due to blocked down pipe. Two engineers have attended having both been told it was a blocked toilet. The first engineer reported back to supervisor that it required an engineer who could flush out the stack as he called it but a second engineer arrived without the necessary equipment to do the job so consequently I am still waiting and have no other toilet in the property. I am a pensioner and have been a loyal customer since 2017 without making a single claim. I have to say I am most displeased with the service provided so far. To be fair the engineers who attended tried their best to resolve the problem but it was down to the supervisor not booking the appropriate equipment to do the job properly.,HomeServe
"Homeserve came when they said they would.  The plumber identified the problem quickly and fixed it in 10 minutes. He was friendly, polite and helpful.  ",HomeServe
A competent plumber arrived. He resolved the issues with new fittings.,HomeServe

I had an external pipe leaking. The plumber was friendly and efficient.,HomeServe
"We had a problem with our immersion heater, bubbling over during the night. I telephoned Homeserve for a visit, and was fitted in for 8:00 - 13:00 a few days after. The plumber came dead on 8:00 and fitted a new thermostat. We were happy how the plumber left the place as clean and tidy as it was when he came. ",HomeServe
"From the initial call about the burst pipe to the plumber sorting was speedy, clean and super efficient.  Excellent service all round ",HomeServe
"One who had visited to check the  blocked drain, was very polite and did the job well. ",HomeServe
"Operative was polite and helpful. Cleared the blockage however failed to clear the waste from under the kitchen cupboards, which would have shown him that there was a leak",HomeServe
Although it took several visits to solve a complicated water supply problem the workers were efficient polite and very helpful when the work was finished any pieces of concrete and rubble were taken away so we had nothing to do ,HomeServe
The first time the plumber came out to replace the flusher in my toilet didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem keen on doing it. When he left the toilet started leaking and wax not fixed in correctly. I reported this and he came out again and instead of fastening my toilet down he has put a disc under the front of it which I can see and put sealant around the toilet  which I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think will last very long before the toilet moves again because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not fix down because he said he had no fixings? I might add the plumber was very nice and polite. ,HomeServe
"Homeserve were called when we discovered we had water coming through our kitchen floor. Plumber attended within a few days and told us we had a burst pipe under our concrete floor.We then went through this scenario for 6 weeks with various stages of Leak Detection, Asbestos Testing etc.that had to take place.We felt that at times there were long delays between each stage and that some of the Homeserve team weren't entirely sure about certain aspects.Having water that continuously poured onto your floor every time you had to turn it on and then clearing it all up continually afterwards has been incredibly stressful.We feel Homeserve let us down with delays and could have responded quicker.However, the Plumber who was called Lee actually ended up fixing the leaking pipe. Polite, respectful at all times. A big Thank you Lee for everything and all your help. Homeserve are lucky to have you on their team.",HomeServe
"We had an issue with water pipes that were causing pressure issues to neighbours property. After investigation it was stated that our water pipe needed replacing. Work commenced to replace water pipe but was not being conpleted to the correct standard. Other Homeserve engineers attend to complete work but could not complete then contractors were issues with the work. The new contractors continued with the work but again were not completing the work to the correct standard. After several issues and months; Homeserve engineers, contractors new contract engineers were assigned the work to replace water pipes and work was conpleted over a weekend. The work started in November and finished in February. My block paved patio is still exposed with access limited for a push chair for my 2 year old. Not impressed with communication, standard of work, length of time on job and work still waiting to be put right.",HomeServe
"Nice to know I can get someone in for an emergency. Though they failed to locate the source of the problem! Then, after they'd damaged the bathroom (with my approval) to find my leak, they would not fix the problem. It was actually a leaking tap, I discovered. Then they said my policy didn't cover tap replacement, even though they had ripped up behind my toilet to find the leak. And it was nowhere near the toilet!!",HomeServe
He was only here for about 15 minutes only tried rodding then with one rod and then told me I had to ring water board had to wait another 48 hours still with smell coming back through toilets,HomeServe
In order to make an appointment for a plumber to fix a leaking pipe I was unable to speak to an actual person to say where the leaky pipe was. When a plumber arrived he was unable to do anything as the pipe was too close to the boiler. I still had to pay Ã‚Â£30 even though he was unable to fix the leak. I have had to get another plumber to sort out the problem. Time and money wasted on automation. ,HomeServe
Tradesman arrived promptly. Tried a different way to deal with the blockage which worked very pleased with the results. Very happy with the service. My only problem is the next years quote. As a pensioner on a limited budget I will not be able to renew. I would recommend Homeserve. ,HomeServe
"Normally very good but on this occasion I paid the excess only to be told when he arrived it's a shared drain so couldn't touch it and left after a few minutes. Update after home serve response, I did say to the handler the drain goes from next-door through my garden but at no point did they say to call Thames Water ",HomeServe
"Absolutely terrific. It was Sunday afternoon at 4pm I called Home Serve and explained to a virtual person the problem which was a leaking U-bend under the kitchen sink. Not an urgent problem because you can get round the problem by using a different sink, temporarily. However, I paid my Ã‚Â£30 excess fee by card over the phone (still to a virtual person). The mechanic appeared at my house at 5.15pm, fixed the issue and left. Fantastic service late on a Sunday afternoon. Thank you.",HomeServe
"Our Downstairs Loo Cistern developed a crack & started leaking very badly. The HomeServe Engineer would not deal with the emergency, giving the reason that as we had more than one toilet in the house, it was not covered within the contract. This was very disappointing,particularly as this statement does Not appear in any of my HomeServe documents!",HomeServe
"Easy to book appointment online. Plumber arrived within the timescale given, and gave me advance notice that he was in the area. Job done quickly and efficiently.",HomeServe
Two engineers came together and quickly sorted out the leak from an outside down pipe. After 4 months it no longer drips.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,HomeServe
"The engineers from Homeserve are usually very helpful, polite and efficiÃƒÂ«nt.. However the man who came to fix my blocked kitchen sink was, very curt, impatient, in a tearing hurry by the way he acted.eg!, He asked for a basin to catch the water from the blocked pipe, and tried to grab one that was close, he nearly broke it and I had to sharply tell him to wait 2 seconds in order to release it from its storage space. Just before he left I asked him for advice to prevent this blockage coming back anytime soon, he scowled, muttered something that I couldn't understand and just rushed away without a further word. Admittedly he DID clear the blockage but it was a very uncomfortable visit. Infact, I don't ever want him in my property again. ",HomeServe
"A leaking tap was discovered. The service desk was very helpful and fixed an appointment for that day.The engineer arrived on time, was very knowledgeable, speedy and pleasant. Fitted a new tap. An excellent job all round.",HomeServe

An engineer attended on a Sunday morning and quickly established exactly where the problem was and it was all sorted by lunchtime.  We are very happy with our Home Serve contract, definitely gives us peace of mind.",HomeServe
The chap who came was most helpful and explained everything in very simple terms. He explained the leak was under the downstairs flooring which had been boarded and without creating an inspection hatch in every downstairs room the leak could not be located or fixed - can you contact me at some point to discuss this matter further ?,HomeServe
"The plumber was professional, polite and informative. ",HomeServe
"Plumber came out and can't do it,so that was a waste of money ",HomeServe
The lady enginneer phoned me on my landline before coming to my house to unblock my kitchen sink. She was fast efficient and friendly and on time. ,HomeServe

Leaking taps,HomeServe
My tub tap was changed unnecessarily. I was told that the tap would be similar but later a very tiny tap was fitted which looks horrible. Already raised the issue and waiting to be resolved. He should have showed me prior to  cutting the another one off. ,HomeServe
"We had a problem with a hot water tap in the downstairs toilet. Making an appointment was straightforward and we were given a time slot. In due course the engineer contacted to say when he expected to arrive. He arrived as indicated and found the problem was a badly corroded tap and the other one was not much better and could not be repaired.Without any prompting from us he said the taps needed changing, showed us which new taps he had and then fitted the ones of our choice. We were very pleased with the excellent service.",HomeServe
Had a call from HomeServe asking if it would be ok for plumber to call 2 days earlier than arranged? Plumber then rang to say he would be with us in 30 minutes. Faultless service from a really lovely plumber.,HomeServe
My 91 year old mother had a blockage in her downstairs toilet and was told it would be five days before an appointment was available despite advising them that she was disabled and found it difficult to get up the stairs (where there is another toilet). She had to call a local plumber which does rather defeat the purpose of the Homeserve policy. ,HomeServe
"Amazing service. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d only been a customer for 3 months before I had to claim. So easy to book an appointment, I was kept updated as to when the engineer would arrive on the day and my issue was solved that day. He spent time explaining the issue to me, showed me what he was doing to fix it and then fitted me a new tap, with no extra charge. The engineer was lovely, I felt safe and in good hands. Highly recommend this company and the service they provide. ",HomeServe

When you suddenly have a water leak it is all stress.To have a plumber attend within 3 hours  and fix the leak is all anybody could want.I am so pleased with the policy that I have had for many years and hardly used. Your plumber was brilliant and went the extra yard to make sure we were ok.Thank you.,HomeServe
"We are experiencing a problem with a blocked toilet. We requested a copy of the inspection report following our Homeserve visit, as we need to send it to our builder. We made this request almost 2 weeks ago and we have still not received anything.I am updating this review on Friday 8 March. Despite requesting the report to be sent again, I have still not received it! I have phoned Homeserve and once I finally got through to someone, I was told to expect a call back! Still not heard a thing!",HomeServe
Enthusiastic and expert staff who quickly sorted out the drainage problem - highly recommend Homeserve.,HomeServe
"Engineers friendly and explained what needed doing. It was a difficult job but they persevered. It took ages - not because of the work but lots of rescheduling. I was left with reduced water pressure which I reported a month ago. Have had to chase up as still no engineer booked to follow up. Everyone I have spoken to has been helpful but the delays, rescheduling at short notice and lack of information is frustrating and makes it difficult to know when things will be finished ",HomeServe
From phone call to sorting the job out it was great service. The engineer who turned up to unblock our under ground main pipe where the blockage was. He was a very nice a churpy chap & job done within 30 minutes ,HomeServe
The plumber was excellent. We couldnt fault him. However we were disappointed that we phoned about our leak on the Thursday and Homeserve said the earliest anyone could come out was the following Tuesday unless it got worse.  The ceiling was already starting to bow,HomeServe
"I was quite excited to join it, I had a issue with the mixer tap. The plumber wasn't very helpful. I told him that I have joint problem so the mixer with a rotating tap would not be helpful. Even though the twist tap was available on a cheaper price at the Screwfix the plumber had decided to go ahead and buy the rotation one. Even I didn't had a feedback message from homeServe. That was a surprise. ",HomeServe
Came out the same day as I reported my leaking toilet. Replaced part and fixed the problem. Great service. ,HomeServe
Very efficient service. Engineer arrived to unblock drain within 3 hours of reporting the problem ,HomeServe

Great service and quick response to our blocked drain. Friendly & professional engineers.,HomeServe
"The Plumber arrived the next day as promised, found the fault and showed me how to deal with it.  It was a space at the bottom of the shower window that had caused the leak.  It was good to know quickly.It would have been helpful to have a half-day window rather than a full day one.",HomeServe
"The appointment booking process, along with the punctual arrival of the plumber, resulted in a comprehensive inspection of the leak. It was admirable to see him taking the necessary precautions, such as covering his shoes before entering the house. A job well done.",HomeServe
The plumber kept at the problem  until the drain was flowing freely rather than just shifting enough of the blockage to allow water to trickle through,HomeServe
"Phoned 30 mins prior to appointment.Was polite, and respectful of property, put on overshoes, so no wet floors as it was raining outside. Clearly advised me of my options for my dripping tap. Completed the work and cleared up afterwards  ",HomeServe
We called you out in December and January.The first time it took 2 hours for you to get back to us with an appointment time.With water running down the walls we had to get another plumber.The second time you charged us the the Ã‚Â£30 but your plumber could not do the job.Again we got another plumber in to repair the leak.,HomeServe
"The plumber arrived on time, explained the reason that the system was leaking due to the incorrect fitting of the cistern and explained what was needed to stop it a#happening again in the future. ",HomeServe
The plumber that visited my house fitted the free issue bathroom taps but did not check the cold water in-line turn off tap and the leak after fitting came through the ceiling having to prompt another visit to remedy.Badly staining my kitchen ceiling. This has been repaired but need not have happened if a pressure check had been conducted.,HomeServe
"The work was done quickly and efficiently, although we did have to wait a few days between reporting the problem and the plumber attending",HomeServe
"My blocked drain took over a week to be fixed. My appointments were cancelled three times all at the very last minute, communication was nonexistent with all but one being when I phoned to check when the engineer was going to turn up. When the engineer did turn up he was professional and very thorough.",HomeServe
Very easy website for booking appt Extremely quick response time with calls from plumber as promised with an accurate ETA. Informative explanation from plumber about the job done so altogether a five star service. ,HomeServe
"We paid our excess of Ã‚Â£30 the engineer turned up and said did no why he was called out as could not see a leak , but that was why we called them out as Severn Trent told us using excessive water and not outside !!!! We are contacting a company called aspect who do proper leak searches , so why did we pay Ã‚Â£30 and what is the point of homeserve ???? Severn Trent have fitted a new meter !!!!! No actual investigation took place !!! ",HomeServe
Got a sameday appointment. The plumber was very helpful and informative in explaining what the issue could have been but unfortunately he was not able to repair the issue as the toilet had stopped leaking. Advice given again to keep an eye if it leaks again then to call again.,HomeServe

Sympathetic lady on phone who listened to me and booked for plumber that evening. He came within timescale and was really friendly and sorted the plumbing out. ,HomeServe
"We have been with HomeServe emergency plumbing for a couple of years now. They have sorted out past issues quickly and efficiently and to our total satisfaction. Our most recent issue was a serious water mains leak from our upstairs bathroom sink that caused a dangerous crack throughout our kitchen ceiling (it happened really quickly!) and HomeServe moved appointments around to get to us as quickly as possible. Once the engineer arrived, we discovered that our ceiling in our kitchen was made of Artex (asbestos coating) and the engineer could not examine the problem without an asbestos removal company removing the very damaged ceiling. This took several days, but HomeServe took care of us every step of the way and we are now back in our home with our plumbing fixed by HomeServe. We are now contacting our home insurance company to repair the damaged ceiling, but we are forever grateful to HomeServe for sorting out what turned out to be an extremely complicated plumbing problem. ",HomeServe
"The whole process was easy, the plumber called before he arrived and kept us informed all through the work.",HomeServe
Very efficient in all aspects of plumbing ,HomeServe
The plumber who came was good at his job but was sadly lacking in any customer service skills. The job was completed but all he appeared interested in was getting to his next job. See no,HomeServe
Had a leak from my washing machine. Sent a person out very quickly and that person certainly knew what it was so quickly. A washer had come out of a tube and the man had one in his van. Leak sealed. An excellent job done. I ,HomeServe
"I was promised from the customer care that the leak was covered. Took the payment and booked appointment. The plumber just took the picture of the leak and said they won't cover it.I am not sure why the pictures were not requested at the initial claim. Clearly,  the person said they would do the repair and payment taken. When called back, the customer service team were unhelpful. I am feel like I have been scammed. Waste of time and money.  ",HomeServe
An efficient and pleasant plumber turned up and sorted the problem as arranged.,HomeServe
Prompt service. From the first contact to the job being fixed was excellent.The plumber was polite and respectful during the visit.,HomeServe
Easy to book a callout and contractor arrived on time and unblocked the drains. Friendly and helpful guy. ,HomeServe

The service was very good but I have still got leaks ,HomeServe
"The short flush button on the toilet was sticking and not working in Nov 2023. I thought that I had arranged for a plumber to come the next day. This did not happen. Furthermore, the excess had been deducted twice from my bank account and it is only recently that I have been reimbursed from the bank.The next day, 3rd Nov., I managed to book a plumber but had to pay a further excess. The plumber decided a new push button & siphon was needed. He couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find the parts & checked with HQ who decided that we needed to source the parts at our expense.We did this but had to purchase the complete cistern.A different plumber fitted the parts shortly afterwards. The flush was now working. A few weeks later small quantities of water began to appear on the floor which became progressively larger. The cabinet around the cistern became swollen. Homeserve were contacted and another excess of Ã‚Â£30 paid. The plumber decided the seal at the bottom of the cistern had moved out of position and allowed water to escape & it was replaced from the parts originally purchased. Everything seems to be working now. After these incidents, the toilet system will need refurbishment.This incident has served to show that Homeserve is an inefficient organisation that has failed to to honour its commitment to pay for parts.",HomeServe
"Ease of contact and arranging a plumber to call. He arrived on the date and within 10 minutes fixed the leak as he didn't have to take the cistern down, ",HomeServe
The on-line booking was straightforward and easy to navigate.  The plumber was on time and very polite and respectful of the property.  He was booked in to do two jobs and carried out his jobs in a professional manner and tidied up when he was finished.  Would definitely recommend Homeserve.  ,HomeServe

"Great plumber, on time, knowledgeable and explained everything very well. ",HomeServe
The technician (Peter) was pleasant and knowledgeable. He soon found the cause of the water leak. The panelling in the bathroom had to be removed to access the problem which he was able to fix.

"The leak under the sink unit was repaired, thankyou.I was disappointed however that I was requested to pay another Ã‚Â£30 excess to repair a dripping tap in the bathroom.",HomeServe
"It was not till the third person came 6days later that they jetted my drain. But all the people that came tried their hardest to help me, and were friendly. I think the people that sort the jobs should make sure the van has the right equipment on to do the relevant job.",HomeServe
Blocked drain and home serve were quick and efficient in sorting out the problem.,HomeServe
No problems getting an appointment which had to be delayed by a few days because of an emergency elsewhere.   All went smoothly and Homesrve arrived on time and did the job and cleared my blocked drain.Everyone was polite and helpful.Thanks.,HomeServe
"I expected lots of questions and reasons why I wasn't entitled to a claim however I was very pleasantly surprised. One phonecall and an engineer was sent out to investigate.  He was really knowledgeable and helpful.  The fault turned out to be the responsibility of the water company but no one made me feel that I had wasted their time and the engineer advised me on what to say when I contacted them. Great customer service, thank you Homeserve. ",HomeServe

I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think I would need to use them, but have had several stop taps fail in succession and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m rather embarrassed by the number of times IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had to call them out.On each occasion the booking process has been straightforward, their people have turned up when they said they would (phoning me an hour beforehand so I can be ready) and have done the work well and with minimum of fuss.I was particularly impressed by the fact that they put protectors over their shoes before walking across my carpets !CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recommend this service highly enough. ",HomeServe
"I have tried to make 3 claims on this policy and all have been rejected by Home Serve saying they are not covered. This latest one is for the temperature control on the shower. How can showers not be considered under plumbing and not be covered?? Will not be renewing, so disappointed. ",HomeServe
"I called Homeserve due to a leak at my rental property. The engineer/plumber arrived at the agreed-upon time but claimed it had been ""fixed"" after only 10 minutes. He left without turning the water back on or verifying the repair. Consequently, I called Homeserve again to have the issue addressed.I was assured that someone would arrive by 10:00 PM. When I called at 9:45 PM to inquire about the delay, I was informed they were still on their way. However, at 10:00 PM, no one arrived. Upon calling again, I was advised that no one could come until midnight.Although they called at midnight, they informed me they needed to reschedule. Despite having landlord insurance to cover such situations, it was rendered useless as I had to call another plumber who arrived within 3 hours of contacting them. He confirmed that Homeserve had never even attempted a repair.I requested compensation from Homeserve, but they showed no concern and offered no assistance. Consequently, I am now dealing with an angry tenant and I am out of pocket because Homeserve failed to communicate or provide help.I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. ",HomeServe
"The day I reported my leak all the computer systems were 'down' and no appointments could be made. I was told they would call me back within 24 hours, which they did not. I rang again and an appointment was made for later that day. The plumber was efficient and professional. ",HomeServe

"Second engineer to visit absolutely set to work, despite not having jetter equipment. He worked hard and fixed the problem, showing skill, attention and commitment to sorting the problem. Very impressed. Stark contrast to first engineer who wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get on with it because he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have jetter and scampered off after five minutes with excuses. So a mixed experience overall. Some engineers problem solvers and some idle technicians. ",HomeServe
"The plumber sent to fix our leak was very professional and quick. We were disappointed at the response time to answer our call and the lead time before he could arrive,",HomeServe

"   The appointment was booked on Friday between 17-22 pm. I receved a phone call around 19:30 to be informed that is not engineer available for that day and they will re-book another day. I wasn't happy at all, because i swap a shift at work for that day. The lady she phoned me wasn't very professional, when i told her that I am not happy she hang up very quick. The engineer said is noting wrong with the toilet and left. My toulet still the same after he told me to put some descale. ",HomeServe
First call was for the Friday but got a call to say the that my visit was  cancelled and would call on Sunday . Called on Sunday as arranged and a excellent job was done. New tap fitted and all is well. Very pleasent enginer. Fixed in less than a hour.,HomeServe
"If it was possible to leave no stars I would. What a shocking service this company provides. My 84 year father has been treated appallingly and I would advise anyone who relies on a service to protect your loved ones this is not the service to rely on. The first time called out end of January. Called Feb 27th because of the same issue appointment made for Friday 1st March. On the same day Seven Trent Engineers (excellent by the way) came out to establish the issue was on his property and did not understand why it had not been detected. Homeserve due on Friday 1st March called to say they needed to cancel the appointment. No alternative time or date given. I called and they placed the appointment with another engineer. That appointment was cancelled at 5pm with no call. It was rescheduled for Saturday 2nd March. Engineer, I question this term. Turned up to the job as the issue was a backed up toilet waste pipe from the ground to the first floor. Turned up with ""no jets"" or ""hoses""!!!!!! My 84 year old dad had to give him his own personal hoses from his shed to use!!!! On a cold morning walking down 8 steps. Can you believe that! He was told work needed to be carried out by an engineer to dig out the waste pipe the one who turned up was not able to do this. Appointment was made for Saturday 9th March. Issue had not been resolved. Today 7th March at 3pm he received a call to say the appointment for Saturday 9th March had been cancelled  because the ""van"" for the area has broken down today. Just so HomeServe are aware I raised the complaint Friday 1st March and called again today 7th March. I understand appointments are cancelled for unseen reasons. However he is an 84 year old man and this shoddy work first started  January 27th. I find it appalling elderly people are treated this way. This is the first time in many years of paying he has used this ""service"" and I use that term generously. The issue is not resolved as the appointment has been rescheduled for Tuesday 12th March. I doubt any of the engineers or anyone at HomeServe would want their loved ones treated this way. I have raised the complaint again today. This is still an ongoing issue. My dad is waiting for the same issue to occur again!!!!This is a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""With cover for your homeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pipes, drains, toilets and tanks, you can be confident that plumbing and drainage problems wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop you in your tracks.""

Homeserve delt with my water leak very well. They came and found the leak and fixed it with in about 2 hours very pleased with the work they did.,HomeServe
A huge thankyou to homeserve after being left in a mess by another plumbing company and being ripped off. Homeserve came on time with a very friendly engineer who was extremely knowledgeable and informative explaining what was wrong and what was needed to be done. He respected our property even putting covers on his shoes to protect our carpets. He had all parts needed on the van and the job was completed promptly and professionally and the bathroom was left spotlessly clean. He then explained exactly what had been done and said any more problems don't hesitate to call them. I don't know the engineers name as I forgot to ask but he was foreign but I can't reccomend him highly enough. Once again a huge thankyou homeserve you reduced my stress levels massively and stopped my living room ceiling dripping anymore. ,HomeServe
" Craig not only located the leak which was difficult he then devised a plan to   re-lay a whole new main into my home with minimum internal disturbance.  The re-instatement is excellent, you would find it difficult to find where they had dug.  They were always respectful of my home and ourselves.  Antony Davies was also very helpful too.",HomeServe
Setting up my Home Emergency Cover for plumbing and Drainage on line was so straight forward and quick to do. Now I have peace of mind.,HomeServe

"Was initially impressed with the service, booked same day engineer came out and good communication in regards to the arranging the visit. However after being here for a total of 3 minutes declared there was nothing he could do as an installation problem (new build) with the venting then left. Contacted our developer immediately and they said very unlikely but will come and check it out. Turns out it was a blocked drain which after checking is covered with the Homeserve. If I followed his advice to get a private plumber to sort out the Ã¢â‚¬Å“venting issuesÃ¢â‚¬Â it would of cost thousands! Contacted Homeserve who still havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t given me a response over a week later. ",HomeServe
"Failed to turn up on 3 occasions, 2 without warning. When they did arrive on two occasions they simply failed to put the problem right. On the 3rd visit they still left work not completed.

Patrick and the second man who cane worked hard to get rid of blockage Thank you,HomeServe
Richard the engineer was absolutely amazing. He came out 4 or 5 days after the call and initially he thought he was going to have to rebook an appointment so they could find the blockage but he persevered and managed to unblock the pipe and put the sink back together. He explained everything as he went along,HomeServe
Great customer service! The plumber came out to us the next day and fixed our toilet and tap. Would recommend Homeserve to family and friends.,HomeServe
Amazing service when vulnerable people in house. Even came back & fixed over flow next day. CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fault service ,HomeServe

"Sean the plumber was prompt and efficient and carried out two of our three claims.The leak from the waste pipe under the bath he said was caused by a builder moving the bath to lay a new floor, so it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wear and tear and he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t repair it. I paid Ã‚Â£90 for 3 claims. I rang Homeserve to ask for a refund of Ã‚Â£30 for the claim that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get repaired.

The engineer came out fixed the leak. 2 weeks later i had to call them back again as it was still leaking from the same joint. Both plummers were polite and considerate but it was annoying that the had to come out twice for the same leak.,HomeServe
The 1st engineer hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tightened one of the joints enough and I was left with it dripping. ,HomeServe
The last visit we had was extremely helpful and actually managed to clear and remove some debris from the waste pipe.

I called HomeServe as I had a toilet that easily blocked and caused the flush to rise up to just under the level of the brim. The engineer soon sorted it out and changed the flush level.,HomeServe
"We had a cartridge replacement for our tap at the backend of 2023 which went OK for a few weeks then the tap was rotating backwards rather than being upright when shut off. A second homesite engineer came out for the  same job to correct the tap. His response was just shut off the water carefully so the tap did not rotate backwards.  We were charged a second Ã‚Â£30 and he was hardly here 5 minutes.  Therefore we cancelled Homeserve as we were not happy with the work completed as our tap is still not working as it should do, but the left hand side tap is working correctly,  it is just the right hand hot tap.",HomeServe
Homeserve are easy to contact i was sent an engineer on the same day  I was telephoned when engineer was 20 mins away The job was successfully completed and all was left tidy The engineer was polite and courteous as was the staff member who booked my call.

"Reported a leaking tap, plumber said it was not leaking,   Perhaps the leaking was coming from one of the pipes, so he sealed the joints, u bends etc.,  tap is still leaking, on investigating myself, found the leak was from an old repair, the sealant had become unsealed, so not very happy.   I will attempt to do the sealant myselfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.",HomeServe
"Sharon who phoned saying when the plumber would arrive was great, as was the plumber himself. One star off because of the first person i spoke to. To be asked how was my day when i'm ankle deep in water was not a conversation i wanted to have or being told i would have to wait 2 days for a repair showed how much i was being listened too",HomeServe

HomeServe engineer arrived on the appointed day to repair a leak on my underground water supply pipe. Tested the pipe to locate the leak then dug down and repaired it. Very good service on a miserably wet day. Recommended!,HomeServe
Quick and easy. Someone attended the following day for a non urgent matter. Plumber was bery friendly and efficient. ,HomeServe
"I had a blockage, when the representative arrived he said his van was not equipped with power flush and hopefully he could clear the blocked drain using his rods. Eventually the blockage cleared. Surely if a representative is sent to any property to clear blockages he requires tools to do the job. If the blockage could NOT be cleared I would not be a happy customer and I would not have given 4 stars probably 1 star for turning up.",HomeServe
This was urgent regarding the drains. The agent dealt in an excellent way to make sure someone came on the day. The worker who came was very understanding helpful and professional and sorted the problem out so we were very pleased.,HomeServe
"Engineers were very helpful, nothing too much trouble,fixed the problem, no more leaks",HomeServe
The first plumber turned up and said we werent covered to have the radiator replaced (which we were) so another appt had to be made 4 days later. That guy turned up and was 2.5 hours as he had to go off for an hour to buy a radiator .. why didnt the measurements get taken the first time so the 2nd time he had it?,HomeServe
Quick and easy repair to our leaking toilet cistern. Only took around ten minutes. Engineer apologised for being later than expected due to a major problem with another customer. He was pleasant and friendly and efficient. No issues at all.,HomeServe
Fast efficient booking and service. Plumber came as promised and sorted out leak. This service is very re-assuring to those of us who are elderly and vulnerable,HomeServe
"The plumbers had to come 3 times, 2,13 and 26 Feb. To unblock the pipe ,  mend the leak and unblock further this pipe",HomeServe
The plumber who came to fix my tap was honest and reliable. There were some other things he pointed out which we did after paying a further excess.,HomeServe
"I took up the offer for cover for minimal cost and have had occasion to call them out three times. They have been excellent on each occasion. The Plumbers have been friendly and efficient, I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate to recommend HomeServe. ",HomeServe
"We called HomeServe for a blocked sewer drain and the system automatically dispatched someone the next day. A really friendly engineer did a temporary fix within a couple of hours, and then another came round the following week to do a more permanent one. Very happy with the entire experience - the least painful insurance claim I've ever done. ",HomeServe
It was easy to make the claim and book the engineers visit. Dan the engineer arrived at the time specified and was so helpful and thorough. He was here a long time locating the leak and was relentless in solving the problem. Dan is a credit to the company he works for and to Home Serve.,HomeServe
I called up as we had a leak on our driveway. It was easy to report and once I paid the excess fee an appointment was made for the next day. When they came out a drain had collapsed but it was a shared pipe so they contacted the water board and arranged for them to come out. Very pleased with their service.,HomeServe
I had a leak in bathroom toilet which was fixed satisfactorily and a other one teo weeks later. Both times the response was instant. The first one the next day. The second the same day. I can recommend Homeserve. First date 22/2/24 and  7/3/24,HomeServe
"From setting up my account, to using the app,  to booking a repair visit everything was so easy.   As for the plumber who attended my property Rob,  what can I say a real professional.   He explained everything to me fully,  kept all the mess to a minimum and then before he left checked every item and cleaned the area he was working in.  ",HomeServe
"Having answered all questions correctly, the advisor booked an electrician who when he arrived said it was a plumbing job.  I therefore asked for a refund of Ã‚Â£30 call out fee which I have not yet received",HomeServe
The plumber was excellent. very impressed with his work.,HomeServe
Great Value plumbing insurance,HomeServe
We noticed a substantial leak at 5.30pm on a Monday and rang Homeserve. They said someone could come out on Wednesday but when I explained it was thro the ceiling they rang back and someone came the next day.Dave was brilliant- it was a complicated job and he stayed late to get it sorted.

Engineer was here on a Sunday within an hour & half of the start time of appointment registered so less disruption of my day. Leaking tap repaired very quickly with engineer explaining clearly how he would fix it.,HomeServe
"Getting in touch wasnt easy and when I did after several times, all systems were down! So no one could help me at all. They took my details and advised I would be called back next day. Needless to say... I wasnt!! So I tried again and got through to someone working from home who couldnt understand me plus they had a child playing /shouting in the background which wasnt good for me and lack of customer service.   I was passed around trying to get an emergency appointment as I had only trickle of water in my house. At first I was refused then when I complained I got one for next day.The visit I got was excellent.  John introduced himself firstly with a courtesy call. He was prompt on arrival and extremely personable.  He explained everything he was doing, asking if this and that he did was ok. He fixed my problem which was great and I told him how grateful I was.  I would give John a 5*.  But have given 3* overall due to lack of customer care with my calls and discussions. ",HomeServe
Great service . Reported a small leak and was able to book an appointment next day. The plumber was courteous and efficient and job was completed quickly with no mess left. ,HomeServe
Leaking outside pipe fixed with excellent workmanship ,HomeServe

"I am a widow and live alone. I have a policy with HomeServe as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“homeowner requiring assistance in the event of a problem at their property with plumbing, drainage and electrics.Ã¢â‚¬Â On 10th December 2023 just such a problem arose, with the waste pipe having become blocked on my shower. In response to my telephone call, a HomeServe approved vendor arrived the next day. He entered my house without using shoe covers and sought to unblock the drain pipe through the extremely powerful and vigorous use of a plunger. The engineerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions were unsuccessful and he stopped working after advising of the need to call for a HomeServe drainage engineer. As he was about to leave, I noticed water leaking through the kitchen ceiling and called him back into the house, whereupon he stood on worktops and a wall mounted central heating radiator and proceeded to cut holes in the ceiling. He identified the source of the leak and advised that the flow of water had ceased. The next morning I awoke to find a significant amount of water had soaked the floors of my kitchen and dining rooms. The vigorous use of the plunger had distressed plastic pipe connections, resulting in serious water leakage. On 13th December I had a telephone conversation with Ella Sonei of HomeServeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Customer Care department. She informed me of how Ã¢â‚¬Âabsolutely horrendousÃ¢â‚¬Â the whole incident was, how I did not need to do anything because in her words, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I will do everything to help you.Ã¢â‚¬Â She was in receipt of video footage of the damage sent to her by another HomeServe plumber. This resulted in Ella confirming to me that Ã¢â‚¬Å“this will be a financial claim.Ã¢â‚¬ÂDespite this assurance, HomeServe walked away from the mayhem they had created. Rather than project managing the repair work they had caused, HomeServe left me to arrange matters through my home insurer. This necessitated the removal of the ceiling, men in hazmat suits extracting the exposed asbestos, two weeks of drying out dampness to floor joists and walls using electric dehumidifiers, nine days without a working shower, the replastering of the kitchen ceiling and finally, redecorating. Once the ceiling had been removed, two HomeServe plumbers returned to remove the blockage in the waste pipe. All this meant I had to cancel all the social arrangements I had made for the Christmas period. The repair work was not completed until mid-February. Although aware of my concerns since 13th December, HomeServe has not addressed the severity of the situation. On 21st February HomeServeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jack Clayton telephoned me with the derisory offer of Ã‚Â£150 in compensation. HomeServe has yet to repay my Home Insurance excess of Ã‚Â£550. This is despite Direct Line, my insurer, taking action to recover all its costs from HomeServe, as it considers them to be totally liable for all the totally unwarranted expenditure. HomeServeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Customer Relations Department has not acknowledged, let alone replied to my letter to them of 25th February. What is apparent is that HomeServe is delivering services into customersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ homes without providing the important benefit of an externally audited Quality Management System (QMS) which complies with ISO9001. This is quite staggering. HomeServe does not appear to have policies and procedures covering how plumbing problems should be tackled. It cannot provide evidence that tradesman working on its behalf have been thoroughly vetted and audited as part of an Approved Vendor process. HomeServe caused a catastrophic incident in my home due to its failure to operate with the policies and procedures required to maintain acceptable levels of quality control and assurance. I note that Richard Harpin, HomeServeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founder and chairman was writing in the Sunday Times on 3rd March 2024 with advice to executives about taking a second job. What is quite evident is that he needs to get a grip on his first job. Two immediate priorities are to implement a comprehensive QMS and have it externally audited and to develop a properly functioning procedure for dealing with customer complaints. Mrs J AComplaint Reference:	CMP236829",HomeServe
"We had a suspected leak under the sink where the water inlet tap was found to be very wet. To be careful we called Homeserve who arranged for an engineer  to come later. The engineer took off a panel to investigate and found it to be condensation which was causing a pool of water. He suggested we add extra insulation, which we have done.The engineer was very helpful and professional",HomeServe
You have no communication between the workers and your customers I had so many different people come didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what they had come for  the result is a eye sore  pipes going across the ceiling  what a mess  I had a leak under my kitchen floor  what a laugh ,HomeServe
"Followed instructions to set up a new Plumbing & Drains cover policy in offer provided by water company. Quick and easy to do. Transaction completed in minutes, at a really good price!",HomeServe
When I rang you on 20th and 21st February I should have been told that you do not replace the flexible shower hose connected to the back of my bath taps.  As a result I paid you Ã‚Â£30 for the excess and received nothing in return as the plumber was not allowed to fix the problem.Not at all impressed with this service.,HomeServe
"From the initial call we experienced great customer service,The engineer arrived promptly and  having investigated the blockage he explained everything in detail giving great advice to solve the issue. Many thanks Ã°Å¸â„¢Â ",HomeServe

The engineer was friendly and helpful. Assessed the situation with regard to our blocked drain and with no fuss unblocked it. Throughout the process he kept us informed as to what he was doing. He was also very clean and tidy in his approach to what was a messy job,HomeServe
"The company never passed on communications to each other or myself. I was left for 5 days with a leaking toilet waste pipe running into my kitchen. After 3 days I had to request a hotel, which they also messed up the booking for. The staff on the ground were really good and communicated really well. It was different departments not organising staff or equipmebt to come do the jobs that needed doing. It even took 3 phone calls to the office to get a call back from the manager, who was conveniently in a meeting every time I rang. Toilet waste water is their highest priority apparently and is classed as risk to life. I didn't feel like they treated myself and my family as at any risk or priority. ",HomeServe
Our plumber was excellent! Expertly tackled the issue with our loo and repaired it very quickly. A great job too!Thank you so much. ,HomeServe
"My leaking bathroom sink was fixed in an expert way.  It was a job that required 4 call outs and even though the first of 4 plumbing engineers missed something the next 3 were very pleasant, knowledgeable and fixed everything perfectly.  Such amazing, kind, friendly and professional people.  So pleased to have the protection of the insurance policy.  5 star staff and very approachable office staff who put my mind at rest.

The job was carried out with no mess the plumber was very polite and covered his wet shoes as it was raining outside. He carried out the repair and tidied up any mess he had made ,HomeServe
Very quick and easy to set up the policy for my Plumbing & Drains online offer. ,HomeServe
They came they changed the valves - the drip us mended,HomeServe
"The engineer did what he could to unblock an outside drain but was sent out without the equipment he needed, i.e. a pressure washer (his was broken)He sent a camera down the drain which punctured the blockage and has solved the problem for now.  Not sure whether it will soon be blocked again as I don't think it was properly cleared.",HomeServe
"Fantastic service. Reported a leaking toilet at  in the online app at 11pm on a Monday night, could choose a time slot the next day. I chose 8-1. The engineer rang at 8.30 to say he would be half an hour, arrived bang on time. Very competant and friendly, job completed in under an hour.  ",HomeServe
I had a leaking tap which I reported to HomeServe. An appointment was made for an engineer to attend to the problem on the following day between 12:00 and 18:00. On the day I received a phone call around 12:45 from the engineer to say that he would be arriving to sort the problem in about 30 minutes. The engineer was pleasant and extremely helpful and fixed the leaking tap quickly. Thanks HomeServe for a great service.,HomeServe
"I noticed a leaking radiator valve and decided to book an engineer online, the process was easy and I booked a time and day that suited myself.

Radiator Leak fixed beautifully by the engineer. I'll be keeping my subscription as Homeserve have always given great service and with very reasonable waiting times. Well worth the expense,HomeServe
Homeserve quickly found our water leak and carried out the necessary repair in a quick and efficient manner. The area that needed to be dug was left as though nothing had happened to it and we were very happy with the service we received.,HomeServe
"I got a phone call to say there might be a delay in arrival but person arrived within originally agreed time. He identified the problem and the solution and delivered an excellent service in a friendly and professional way. Problem had been with a blocked drain continually flooding.

Prompt and efficient response to my drain problem,HomeServe
"My Mum is 87 and she called out HomeServe to help with a drainage issue at her house connected with a recent infestation of rats. A HomeServe engineer came out to inspect the matter and quickly advised they could not help. This left my Mum without any assistance and seemed very poor given their role. I have subsequently quizzed my Mum about how long she has had this contract with HomeServe and it sounds like it could be anywhere from 15-30 years. I note HomeServe was set up by Anglian Water in 1993 so it could be almost as long as the company has been running. In that time my Mum has just called them out for a few tap leaks. So my Mum has been hardly a frequent user of their service. However, when HomeServe were finally needed they did not want to know. My Mum was paying over Ã‚Â£400 per year for this service. I accept that's her choice. But if its 20 years then that's around Ã‚Â£8,000 in today's money so that's not great value for just a few taps. That would have been fine if they were prepared to help out now when really needed. HomeServe did offer a reduction of around Ã‚Â£75 per year to my Mum, but when they have provided little or no service to my Mum this is taking the mick!I wrote a letter shortly after the call out to complain. Eventually after a chase we received a holding response and it would be in touch in a few weeks. As the contract was up for review this month we have finally decided to cut our losses and terminate the annual contract and draw a line under their service. We still have the drains and rat issue to address sadly, but that is now being investigated by others. As you can tell I am very disappointed in HomeServe.",HomeServe
Very prompt professional service.The Plumber was simply excellent. Personable and friendly.He worked in a very systematic and organised way.The fault with the cistern was resolved and double tested.There was absolutely no mess at all left behind.I cannot thank you enough for such a fantastic service. From the original phone call to the visit and swift resolution of our problem.This has set a really benchmark in all all aspects of your service.Thank you very much indeed for such a fantastic service.,HomeServe

When I first rang to say my drains were blocked no toilet working was told someone would come as soon as possible  I had to ring again next day to say nobody had turned up in the meantime my grandson had to try to unblock  it as I had no working toilet  eventually a man turned up in the afternoon  he was very nice man and he sorted it all out as I am 80 yes old i think there should be better  service when ther is a problem withe one and only toilet  ,HomeServe
"The problem was dealt with efficiently, the plumber repaired the toilet quickly. ",HomeServe
The most lumber fixed my leaky taps very quickly and efficiently. ,HomeServe
 Called out Homeserve for a dripping tap. They came same day which was great. On checking the taps was told it was not just the cartridge but the actual levers were corroded so they could replace the cartridge but the taps would still drip. They offered to fit new taps and cartridges which would be different style but would not drip so we agreed.  The new taps did not quite fit but the guys altered them till they did and now we have drip free taps once again. Very happy with the service provided. ,HomeServe
We had a blocked drain two engineers attended but could not clear the problem however a third and specialist engineer attended and cleared the problem. Extremely professional and polite. A big thank you to your head office for their concern and immediate responses. ,HomeServe
Only took a few minutes to unblock the sink. Clean tidy and efficient.,HomeServe
The engineer was polite and friendly and new how to remedy my problem as soon as I explained it Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ghost flushingÃ¢â‚¬Â in downstairs toilet. 10 mins and job done leaving the toilet condition as he found it. Also quickly corrected a minor leak on my stop tap. Impressed,HomeServe
The engineer who came out was on time and had good customer service. However the work done did not last the engineer sealed all around where the pipe was going into my waste pipe using CT1. Did not look good at all however it was out of sight. The main issue is that 2 days later the water came through the sealent again and had the same issue. Waste of Ã‚Â£60 call out as I had to then call a plumber who resolved the issue by simply changing the bracket collar which holds the pipe into the waste pipe. Annoying now that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve paid homeserve Ã‚Â£60 and then ontop a private plumber to resolve the issue correctly and not just use CT1.,HomeServe
The service vehicle used was fully kitted to deal with any drainage problem.The service man quickly located and removed the blockage within 30 minutes and fully restored the free flow through the drains There was minimum disturbance to the garden.,HomeServe
"Recent problems with toilet flush and also leaking taps in the kitchen. It was so reassuring to know that I could call Homeserve to help rather than find a plumber. The man who arrived was very friendly and reassuring. He looked at both problems and actually fitted a new flush in the toilet and a new mixer tap in the kitchen. I certainly hadn't expected that. I thought it was washers but he pointed out another area the tap was leaking from on the upright, which I hadn't seen. I am so glad to have Homeserve. I pay monthly and they are very reasonable when you consider I then had the work done for free. I would recommend them to anyone who hasn't got a known plumber easily available, but especially if you are on your own. It's one thing less for you to worry about. Thank you Homeserve.",HomeServe
The Homeserve representative attended at the time promised. He quickly identified the problem and replaced all the necessary parts to ensure our toilet was working properly. He was neat and tidy and courteous throughout. I would not hesitate to recommend Homeserve.,HomeServe
"Our chap arrived, was polite and friendly. Got on with the job and gave us feedback. He assisted us with a phone call to the water company to arrange for them to make repairs on the road side pipework. Excellent service. ",HomeServe
"Well my job finally got done but it took 3 engineer visits before this happened.  The first engineer thought the blockage was outside although I was pretty sure it was under the bath so he said he couldn't do it, it needed someone with a camera.  This engineer was very pleasant despite not clearing the blockage.  The second engineer said he couldn't do it as my septic tank needed emptying.  I had only had it emptied the week before but at his insistence I had it done again at a cost of Ã‚Â£145.  The septic tank operative said this was totally unnecessary.  The second engineer was much less pleasant.  The third engineer listened when I told him where the blockage was (under the bath) and cleared it promptly.  ",HomeServe
The plumber pulled off too many tiles to find the pipe.  He did not act rationally.  He pulled tiles from the floor before he had finished pulling tiles from the wall.  He cost me a huge amount in fixing up the bathroom after he left. ,HomeServe
Telephone call fine - easy to arrange visit.Plumber arrived when stated. Did an excellent job.Fantastic service,HomeServe
"When I phoned up to report a leak I was told their systems were down. 10 hours later HomeServe finally contacted me and after I had paid Ã‚Â£30.00, a plumber attended the next day. He turned off 2 taps and said thats all I am covered for! I lodged a complaint and after many days of waiting I have now been informed it will take up to 40 days to process. Shocking customer service.",HomeServe
"I would have rated this lower if it had been possible. The tap on my bathroom sink has broken so I arranged for an engineer to call. When he came he said he had been told it was a kitchen tap that needed a repair so he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got the parts. Appointment 2 Home Serve cancelled at 7 am on the day, appointment 3 they cancelled at the end of the day after I had waited in specifically and even though I had numerous things I needed to do. This was because the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ job before had taken longer than they thoughtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The next appointment I have been offered is next week when I have relatives in the house from the USA. They seem to have no problem taking my money on time! My advice look elsewhere for cover I know I will next time.",HomeServe
It took the 3rd visit to stop the leak of the overflow pipe. Unfortunately the first two visits did not work. My good assessment was for the 3rd visit.,HomeServe

"Terrible company. I have cancelled my policy. Plumber didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn up in allocated time on first visit, and then didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to have a clue when he finally arrived (after several phone calls).Plumber didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn up on return visit to complete the job. Two morningsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pay lost due to waiting for a plumber that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn up. ",HomeServe
"Thank you soo much for saving my home from water damage (from a leaking pipe) going above and beyond fault finding and repairing, great service and a great job ",HomeServe
We had a blocked external drain and the engineer used a 6Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ pole to try and unblock it - no attempt to use add-on poles; no surprise that he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reach the blockage.  What am I paying this money for I wonder?,HomeServe
I can highly recommend recent plumber ! I was not satisfied with the previous one,HomeServe
Great Service from Homeserve - easy to contact and came out same day to fix tap. Plumber called ahead to confirm arrival time. Replaced both tap heads even though only one was causing the issue and all done in half an hour. I would definitely recommend as it saved so much time trying to find someone to come out for a small job.,HomeServe
Engineer arrived on scheduled time Worked through a few minor issues Satisfactorily cleared the drainage pipeResultHappy customer Thankyou ,HomeServe

"Engineer came in had a quick look and refused to take down the toilet to investigate further. I insisted there is a dripping noise coming from behind the toilet, but because there was no visible leak or wetness, near the back of toilet, he insisted there is no leak or damage.I'm still hearing the dripping sound still but because there is no visible damage anywhere, he advised I should leave it unless I want my whole roof taking down. The plummer was a nice man and came on the prescribed time., but seems like he was in a rush too. ",HomeServe
My drain was blocked bringing undesired stuff from the toilet into the garden arranged for homeserve to come unblock fair play the guy arrived but didnt have the correct equipment on the van so said theyd arrange for someone next day but after ringing me back they said 48h which with 3 kids not to use toilet and have a wash i thought was unacceptable after complaining it was esculated to a emergency someone came out next day to sort.the 1st customer service personel wasnt helpful but couldnt speak more highly of the lady who sorted it after i complained just left a bitter taste in my mouth having to complain to get things sorted,HomeServe
3 day wait for a leak repair.  Plumber has near enough broken the bath panel in two while removing it. Homeserve have refused to compensate for this because I had to sign a disclaimer before he would even have a look.,HomeServe

So fast and efficient. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thrilled with your service. My pipe leak was fixed in 15 minutes. Well worth the money. Thank you x,HomeServe
"The washing sink in the bathroom was dripping water. The taps were replaced alright. But the flexible tubes very old and rusty were not replaced. In my opinion, very soon, if it starts leaking water, I would have make another claim and pay 30 pound. Something that could have been done at the time of replacing the taps.",HomeServe
"Polite young man who changed one of the pipes on my upstairs toilet which was leaking quite badly.  It was a late night call, and he arrived within a few minutes of the call.  He did the job in just a few minutes.  ",HomeServe

"I have recently had a quite extensive leak repair carried out by Home serve. I cannot say how Impressed i have been with the service I received.   The engineers that came were allways on time, very professional and were allways happy to answer any questions  I had.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Homeserve to anyone !!",HomeServe
"We had an issue with the hot tap of our bath. The plumber who arrived was friendly, and had the issue sorted very quickly. The tap now works perfectly.",HomeServe
"Plumber arrived as promised and solved the problem,explaining what had happened.",HomeServe
We had a prompt response however the man who came disagreed with our assessment of the situation and said the drains werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t blocked or collapsed. So we called out a company who pressure washed the drains as they were backing up because the drains were sagging so badly they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t emptying! We then had to have the drains replaced and relaid properly. So the insurance was a total waste of money.,HomeServe
"Man arrived. Friendly face, friendly introduction. Immediately understood the problem and the possibilities for solving. Logically went through issues and our drain was unblocked. You have a success on your hands.",HomeServe
We have been waiting for engineer to contact us to fit us a new radiator that is leaking. We have been having to chase for 3 weeks. Then to be told our claim has been cancelled ,HomeServe
"We had a blocked drain. The engineer came at the agreed time, and was very polite and efficient. He gave us advice about how to avoid the situation in the future.",HomeServe
"Fairly quick appointment, liked warning plumber on way. Very helpful plumber, did good job ",HomeServe
"We called to say that we had sewage coming from a manhole on the drive, they advised that an engineer would be with us in 3 days, only to receive a text to say Ã¢â‚¬Å“sorry not available until 5 days later after intial 3 day wait, so to say I was shocked was an understatement, this wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sink wastage, this was sewerage. Shame on you HomeServe ",HomeServe
Fantastic experience. Blocked drains causing real issues. Promised an appointment in a 2 hour window which was met. Problem resolved in minutes. Engineer extremely professional. Superb service. ,HomeServe
The whole experience was good.  My only comment would be that the time we had to wait for someone to get to us when we had a blocked toilet.,HomeServe
Easy to book a plumber and in a short time.,HomeServe
"Once I had managed to get past the automated system ( which was very tedious and not detailed enough in its reply options) and actually speak to someone the process was good. The external blocked drain was dealt with quickly and efficiently. The engineer was polite,knowledgeable and also gave us some advice on how to prevent any future issues. ",HomeServe
Had a problem with plumbing. Got a lovely service on the phone and the plumber was really great sorted the problem quickly. Great company.,HomeServe

"Arrived on time and sorted out our blockage, very efficient.",HomeServe
"I had a flood in my front garden and the downstairs toilet was backing up. I phoned HomeServe at 1530. The man arrived at 1605, diagnosed the problem and cleared a blockage between my house and the next one downstream (you've never heard such satisfying gurgling and farting noises!). He was packed up and gone by 1620. Lovely man and exceptional service.",HomeServe
"Your technician arrived very promptly. He was a really nice guy who just got on with the job. It was a particularly miserable day and a very muddy job, but he was undeterred and after several unpleasant hours he fixed the leak!",HomeServe
"I had 2 call outs in 2 weeks. The first one was a busy toilet soup pipe. This was sorted within an hour, he noticed my drain was blocked, so he unblocked that & noticed that the drain had collapsed. I put another claim in to rectify the collapsed drain. This now all sorted and we are smell free once again. I would highly recommend taking the cover out, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s has saved us Ã‚Â£Ã‚Â£Ã‚Â£",HomeServe
Excellent from start to finish. Thank you to all involved for resolving the leak for us. Great communication from the crew on the ground who have all gone above and beyond for us. Very impressed and highly recommend. ,HomeServe
Customer service were efficient in dealing with our problem and the engineer was very polite and was able to fix our leaking valve issue with speed and confidence;Would recommend HomeServe.,HomeServe
It was easy to make an appointment and the plumber came on time and did a good job of fitting my tap .,HomeServe
Speedy call out that truly saved the day. Friendly and efficient engineer fixed the water leak. Very much appreciated. I will continue using Homeserve for peace of mind.,HomeServe
The plumber was great.  The administration prior to arrival did not work.  I updated the contact details via a phone call with Ryan - they were supposed to call my partner as I was at work: he should have been the 1st contact.  Instead the plumber turned up at the house and nobody was home.  We were told that we would get a call 15/20 mins before appointment - this would have allowed my partner to arrive on time.  Instead they called me when I was 2nd on the list and not home.   ,HomeServe
"After postponed appointment, & a no show appointment, a new appointment was made:- 12.00 - 6.00, so it was a pleasant surprise, when the team rang in the morning, to say they would be there in an hour. They were efficient, polite, and sorted the blocked drain. They also informed me that if it occured again, or my neighbour, as we have a shared drain, that the Sewerage provider would do it. I knew it applied to blocks of flats, but not just 2 properties sharing a drain. Very grateful.",HomeServe
As always homeserve advisors were extremely helpful. Arranged for a plumber to attend the same afternoon.Fixed my leaking toilet.,HomeServe
Problem due to my wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dementia which I explained to the  phone connection.He assured me that our emergency would be the first on on the rota for the next available day.Your operative arrived bright and early on the due day and checked the biockage had cleared itself and double checked that all was okay ,HomeServe
The plumber was very professional and resolved the issue on time .,HomeServe
The plumber has pulled the toilet off the wall and there is now a 2 inch gap where prior to our problem it was flush. Was the 13th or 6th March.,HomeServe
Lee the engi were was approachable polite and very professional. He was helpful and resolved my outdoor drain issue.,HomeServe
"I had a leak from my en suite shower and, to my horror one day, a large amount of water leaked through to my living room ceiling. I contacted Homeserve and was offered an appointment swiftly. The plumber who arrived was extremely competent, professional and pleasant, and worked tirelessly until he had replaced the leaking pipe. He left the shower clean and tidy and even resealed the unit neatly. ",HomeServe
Quick and easy to book an appointment plumber arrived on time and was very efficeinrt and tidy,HomeServe
Engineer Ashlea Wilson did a wonderful job today. He was able to complete a job an engineer couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do before. Fix my bathroom blockage quickly and very efficiently. It was a difficult job to do but he was very collaborative and did a lot of work very quickly to resolve the issue. 5 star performance!,HomeServe
"Attended promptly on each of the 3 occasions involved in the claim. All staff were courteous, knowledgeable and professional. Firstly an engineer checked the drain and assessed that the toilet itself was at fault; he could not order the required parts as a ""different department"". Then a plumber attended who recommended and ordered new parts for the toilet, which were delivered to us. Then a third visit by another plumber who was unable to complete the repair due to the age and condition of the toilet and its fixings, who advised us to get a new toilet, which we will now do as it's long overdue!",HomeServe
"Great lad who fixed my leak. Not sure on the date he came , but think it was February ",HomeServe
"CALLED FOR AN APPOINTMENT TO STOP THE DRIPPING TAP, THE CALL ANSWERED PROMPTLY AND CALL OUT SCHEDULED  TWO DAYS LATER. ENGINEER TURNED UP ON TIME VERY COURTEOUS YOUNG MAN .ONE HOUR LATER HE HAD REPAIRED THE PROBLEM AND LEFT. MY MOTHER HAD A NEW SET OF TAPS WHICH WERE MUCH BETTER FOR HER AS THEY WERE EASIER TO TURN ON AND OFF. A VERY SATISFYING EXPERIENCE",HomeServe
I paid Ã‚Â£30 for a Homeserve plumber to fix my flushing unit.He arrived and said that the whole plastic unit needed replacing and that Homeserve  could not do the work.I would have to get a plumber to do the work independently.I asked why they were unable to carry out the work and they arranged for another plumber to to come to my house in the afternoon between 1200 hours and 6 am.to review the situation.We waited in but nobody arrived.not even a phone call.We are now seeking the help of a reliable Plumber and will cancel the our  Homeserve contract as soon as possible,HomeServe
"I noticed my toilet was backing up and a smell of sewage. I contacted HomeServe immediately. At the second attempt I got to speak to a human who informed me an engineer will be out by Friday morning. It was 09:35 Sunday morning when I called....hardly an Emergency Service.Renewal request arrived a week later, wondering whether it is worth it...",HomeServe
"The plumber turned up on time . He did a good job , finished on time left the room clean and tidy. A real professional.  Thank you homeserve. ",HomeServe
The staff who attended were outstanding. After a short period of head scratching came up with an excellent fix for my leaking water main.,HomeServe
"Really pleased with the service we got from Homeserve - identifying the source of a leak, addressing and fixing the problem and leaving as little mess as possible. The engineers were friendly and courteous and nothing seemed to be too much trouble.",HomeServe
I had a problem with my water supply in my utility room. Plumber came and tested everything until he found the problem. He had the part in his van and sorted out the issue. It took him a while but he was thorough. He was also very pleasant and polite. Thank you ,HomeServe
Plumber rang ahead. Was friendly and respectful of the property. Fixed the problem quickly and efficiently. ,HomeServe
Easy to arrange appointment My problem was fixed by a very efficient and friendly plumber. ,HomeServe
"They didn't find the fault, so I'm Ã‚Â£30 worse off and still have a leak ",HomeServe
The engineer was pretty efficient but when he said the radiator was leaking on his second visit he removed it and capped it offYour company did nothing about removing the old radiator and wanted Ã‚Â£203 to fix a new one on,HomeServe
The man was lovely but I am still waiting for finalising the leek ,HomeServe
"The engineer that came to fix my problem pipes went above and beyond. I can't rate him high enough. He was polite, helpful and knew axactly what the cause of the problem was with listening to my description. I have needed to use Homeserve twice now to resolve different issues with my property and both times the service was well above excellent from start to finish.I would advise anyone to sign up to Homeserve, it's definitely peace of mind knowing there is someone on hand whenever you fall in to difficulty. Called at approximately 10am and Engineer was with me at approximately 4.40pm that day. Superb service.",HomeServe
"I had a tap leaking into a cupboard and needed a fast repair. Using the online system I reported the fault on a Friday and was surprised to find I could have an engineer come the next day. Great service, friendly engineer and fault fixed!",HomeServe
The engineer was very helpful and listened to my problem.  He cleared the blockage after several attempts and made sure the drain was flowing freely.,HomeServe
After reporting blocked drains at my home the appointment for Homeserve to attend was cancelled 3 times and the 4th appointment they did actually attend. The attending drainage operative was competent and sympathetic to my situation that had taken Homeserve 4 days and 3 cancelled appointments to attend and rectify.,HomeServe
"It took 4 visists to get it right, 2 visits I could accept because you needed special parts, but 4 is a waste of your time. The end result howerver is satisfactory and I have no complaints about the engineers who came, all polite and tidy, only the last  one left it working and not leaking",HomeServe
Fairly quick response time but plumber installed replacement taps to the wrong hot/cold supplies and had to come back to amend it. It was us that realised that they were back to front! ,HomeServe
The person was not pleasant- full of himself. The blockage was not huge but he did not ask for or have with him sheeting/cloth to stop the white residue coating around the drain and dripping all along the path. It sets solid and is very difficult to remove. He also managed to cover the side gate handle with solid white residue.  I found drips in the garage - I don't know why he was even carrying it near there.Instead of asking for cloths bags etc as it appears Homeserve  do not supply them he then simply threw the white cleared stuff into the grey bin. Like most people I wrap my household rubbish so the bin is reasonable inside - I had to put it flat and scrub the white off the inside. It took me longer to clean up than for him to remove the blockage.This mess is unacceptable. Leaving it for an elderly unwell person to clear up is not acceptable. Explain please why we pay a monthly fee plus a Ã‚Â£30 surcharge. So March cost Ã‚Â£50 + to have a mess made.,HomeServe
The engineer seemed to be thorough in checking where the water was coming from. However the following day my washing machine did not work. I asked a friend to come and see if he could find out the problem. The leak was from a pipe in the cupboard next to the washer. The washer was too heavy for me to move. ,HomeServe
"Plumber did a very neat job and solved my problems, very helpful chap.Dripping tap fixed up stairs bathroom taps replaced .Top marks",HomeServe
"The engineer was very helpful and pleasant.  It did take 2 days to get the job done tho, which was worrying as it was a leak..",HomeServe
The plumber Cain was excellent and we hope to have him in the future if we need your service!!!Many thanks to have such wonderful worker in your team!!!,HomeServe
"Had registered with Homeserve in the past but received a leaflet from the water authority inviting me to take up a very good offer. Obviously Homeserve werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to let me have an introductory very low price again! However, they did offer me an increased price but still very, very good, so took them up on it. Documents received as soon as I had completed registration. Very good initial service - weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never had any problems with the pipes or water supply but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good to have peace of mind",HomeServe
"plumber phoned before arrival,very pleasant young man and identified leak quickley.repair done very quickley and very tidy in the process.great work homeserve.",HomeServe
"Plumber arrived during time arranged, phoned to tell he was on the way. He was very pleasant and completed the replacement quickly and efficiently also very tidily ",HomeServe
the agent i spoke to regarding my claim was excellent very polite and knowlegable the plumber arrived a day after my booking and he carried out a superb repair my husband and myself were very impressed well done HomeServe,HomeServe
"The leak detection team took much of the day to find the approximate point of the leak, but did not undertake the repair. They were excellent. But next day the plumbers who Homeserve sent in to find the exact point and repair it were rubbish. they left without repairing the leak and one of them, was rude to me and refused to check where I suggested. My own plumbers found and repaired the leak exactly where I had requested the Homeserve plumbers to look.",HomeServe
Plumbers great now that they are homeserve and not as in the past the rip off merchants contracted. The plumbers resolved the problem of a broken one way valve and provided an additional feature.,HomeServe
CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix the drain but gave advice how to.,HomeServe
Called Homeserve for a visit and the engineer came the same day. He was a really nice chap who arrived within the time slot advised to fix two taps and made sure everything was perfect before he left.,HomeServe
"The plumber came promptly and changed the ball-valve on the c.w.storage tank. Unfortunately the overflow of water before his arrival caused damage to the decorations of the bedroom below. This triggered an insurance claim so I require a statement from you that I called you for assistance on 3rd March and that your plumber repaired the leakage on4th March. Many thanks in anticipation of your reply, from Harold Deutsch",HomeServe
"Firstly operative given wrong address to attend. He then suggested I should  i contact the company to get this corrected although I had 'welcome' documents which showed the correct address.The problem was a dripping tap which after 20 min work was declared fit but will take a while to bed in.He then declared that replacement of tap was not covered , although need for need for tap had not been mentioned so far!  Scrutiny of policy suggested that tap replacement could be covered if tap had failed. In fact it had as tap seat allowed cont drip which only sealed by forced turning - beyond Grand child capability.Left disillusioned and will not use or recommend service in future    ",HomeServe
"Engineer arrived promptly within an hour. Told me he had drained the water tank to stop a leak but he had not, he had only taken the pressure off. Told me the problem was the thermostat, it was not. If my local plumber had taken his word that he had drained the tank and completed the repair it could have caused serious damage to the tank.",HomeServe
"The man spent 30 minutes trying to get the cover up by levering it up when all it needed was to pull the 2 recessed handles at the sides up. I found this impossible to understand for someone experienced in clearing soul pipes. He cleared the blockage in the soil pipe with rods which he handled with rubber gloves on, he then came into the house touching door handles,  the toilet chain, taps with the rubber gloves that were covered in waste from the toilet. I had to disinfect everything he had touched. He then left the soiled rubber gloves on my bathroom floor.I am seriously considering not renewing my contract.",HomeServe
"The service was really great phoned for help at approximately noon , service man was there by 14-45 .Cleared a very serious drain blockage in about 20 minutes. Friendly and very helpful , Paying for this service over several years this was the first time of a call out . So glad I pay for this service every 3 months. ",HomeServe
The HomeServe team assigned a contractor as soon as my claim was processed for action. A leak in the water system under a concrete kitchen floor was located and repaired within two hours fifteen minutes. I was disappointed the holes (3) bored in the concrete floor were left open with makeshift covers placed over them however. The technician informed me filling and tiling was my responsibility. Apart from the open holes I say: a good job done. ,HomeServe
"We had an emergency situation in that our only toilet was blocked, I am diabetic and the medication I take means having to use the toilet on a frequent basis. My husband explained this to the lady at Homeserve who relayed it to the engineer and 90 minutes later he called to say he was on his way. A big thank you to everyone at Homeserve ",HomeServe
Leaking tap fixed in speedy time. We always have a good experience with the plumbing team ,HomeServe
"arrived on time repaired my toilet and did an excellent tidy job, would recommend",HomeServe
Well at last a plumber came and looks like has finally found the problem with my toilet after many attempts very pleasant Plummer as well however I did have to pay an excess of Ã‚Â£30 pounds when it was only months since it had been unblocked.,HomeServe
"I was very pleased when a leaking pipe to the toilet tank was fixed. Tony was polite, kept his head down and did a great job.  Not only did he fixed the leak but, he left me with a dry floor. I am so very grateful. Thank you Tony!!!",HomeServe
The plumber was excellent. He fixed the problem and went out of his way to avoid having to take up our floor tiles in order to get to the pipe work. He managed to remove the sink basin instead which has saved us having to do a big repair. Very helpful. ,HomeServe
Prompt response to claim.  Drain guy turned up the same afternoon.  All sorted with a smile and very professionally.  Making claim was v easy.,HomeServe
"We had barely a trickle of mains water flowing.  The Homeserve engineers responded quickly and were very polite and helpful.  Unfortunately several visits were necessary and moling equipment broke down which delayed progress, however we are very happy that the new water connection is working well.",HomeServe
I had a problem with the cold tap on my bath.Plumber was punctual and fixed my problem quickly. He also made suggestions in order that the same issue didn't repeat itself. Thank you ,HomeServe
They had come in for pipe change but didn't happen,HomeServe
Within two weeks the drain started to block again where as in the past after a Homeserve visit it lasted 1 year or at least 6 months. Clearly on this occasion it was not cleared properly.I managed to do it myself so at the moment it's ok. Why didn't Homeserve do it in the first place.,HomeServe
"Called at 5pm, had a serious leak from my shower going through my kitchen ceiling which also took all my electrics out, engineer rang at 8 15pm and said he would be there within 90 minutes, he didnt show up, no phone call or nothing, I rang and got told because there was a chance he might make some noise after 8 he wasnt coming!even though I have no neighbours either side!rescheduled for the next day didnt show up again, at this point I gave up and got someone else, I paid Ã‚Â£30 call out charge and I am still waiting for a refund over 2 weeks later!!",HomeServe
"Your Engineer efficiently replaced, or repaired as necessary, 3 No. toilet cisterm mechanisms in a timely manner and left everything working properly and left taking all the debris with him and leaving it clean and tidy!",HomeServe
Once the plumber had arrived he was efficient and pleasant and quickly sorted the problem. The only downgrade was that the leak occured at 8.00am and the repair at 4.00pm.  We would have preferred a quicker response.,HomeServe
"I called home serve as there was water under my sink that I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where it was coming from, additionally, the taps on the bath move, so they needed tightening. I asked for those two jobs but was charged for 3, I am still waiting for the reimbursement. I was told to wait 28 days. The Plummer fixed the leak in the Kitchen but refused to repair the bathroom taps",HomeServe
Very pleasant knowledgable plumber. Advised on future possible work,HomeServe
Had a problem with my drain booked a visit itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very easy to do the man called 3 days later fixed the problem in minutes he was so pleasant an helpful canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recommend them enough ,HomeServe

"Quick to answer phone when I called, appointment arranged for next day, engineer arrived at time given had to have a new tap, he was honest with me said taps they were supplied with in his opinion were not up to a good standard, I supplied my own tap he returned next day to change the taps excellent service from company and engineer.

Dean repaired our toilet quickly and was extremely efficient ,HomeServe
My drain was blocked so I called the company and my problem was tackled within 24 hours. They were very prompt in their services and professional. I think I can take it easy now for a long time. Thanks for addressing my disability needs.,HomeServe
Engineer arrived and fixed the problem (burst pipe) while he was there. Very happy with the prompt arrival. ,HomeServe
"The telephone was answered promptly when I needed to report a leak.The engineer was efficient, had the necessary part and put right the problem without fuss.",HomeServe
"Engineer came out immediately at 6pm to deal with our flood, knew exactly what he was doing, stopped the leak in minutes and then helped us to clear away some of the detritus, delightful chap (confirmed by neighbours who he had also helped)",HomeServe
Very satisfied with the contact with the call handler and also the professionalism of the HomeServe plumber that attended my property.  ,HomeServe
"Plumber arrived on time, did the work thoroughly and tidily and solved both problems. ",HomeServe
"We had a plumber booked between 8 -1  , i had organised work around these times . I had a reminder message the day before.  However on the day nobody came . I received a call from the plumber 14.35 to say Homeserve had changed the appointment. I tried contacting you several times , and i have not received the service or my excess. I am one very unhappy customer Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢ ",HomeServe
"The plumber who attended to resolve the leak was excellent and very personable.However, it took 2 weeks from initial call to delivery of service... Which is unacceptable.",HomeServe
"Leak still waiting  for waterboard ( April 5 ) if its leaking on my property  ,you will have to come back .",HomeServe

Toilet fixed - needed a new flange Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â‚¬Ã¯Â¸Â,HomeServe
Had a water leak. Came out the nxt day. Lovely gentleman came very polite and did the job well,HomeServe
Contact was efficient. Plumber was very good and informative. From time of call to plumber on site very efficient. Just had yearly renewal notice and cannotjustify high increase in cost.,HomeServe
They sent their own plumber quickly who paid a lot of attention to detail and did a very good job.,HomeServe
"This was the third engineer that came to visit us to fit a new siphon into our toilet because the previous one had been ordered and was wrong. He changed the siphon but there was a leak which she said he would use a pump to remove when I checked after he had left the water was still there, so I had to get rid of the water myself, it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t part of the job but he said he was going to do it but he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. The new siphon still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work properly. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better than the old one but not really working the water. Still leaks into the toilet from time to time you have to jiggle about with your hand to make it work properly . ",HomeServe
I was very unhappy with the length of time that I had to wait for an engineer to come out. I reported a blocked kitchen sink and downstairs toilet on a Monday morning and an automated system gave me an appointment for the Friday. I managed to contact an actual person on the telephone who said it could be brought forward to the Thursday morning. I was not happy with this but felt I had no control over the situation.  On the Thursday I received a message about midday to say the engineer assigned to my job would not be coming and a different engineer would call round by 6pm. At 4pm I phoned to check that someone would actually be calling only to be told that the appointment had been cancelled and another one would be arranged for the following week. I said that this service was not good enough as I had taken out the policy for Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpeace of mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ( stated on the policy) and expected assistance when I needed it and I had family coming to stay for the weekend and needed to be able to use my kitchen sink. I was finally put through to a different person who said someone would call round the following morning. Thankfully an engineer did call on the Friday morning and he was extremely helpful and solved the issue within 40 minutes. I would say that although the engineer service was competent and efficient I feel that the length of time I had to wait was unacceptable and I was extremely disappointed with Homeserve from this point of view. ,HomeServe
Water leak was dealt with swiftly and effectively although the solution was provided by an engineer rather than a plumber even though it was a basic plumbing fault in our downstairs WC.Our only concern or misgiving was to be told there still appeared to be a leak between the main stop-cock for water supply in the kitchen and the outside water meter 30 feet or more down the road.We were advised to call Homeserve the next day to get the services of an engineer or plumber but our meter readings could not justify another call out (or another 'excess charge') so we have not followed through.,HomeServe
"Expert plumber, friendly, quick and efficient to resolve the problem",HomeServe
"The plumber arrived on time, was very nice and helpful carrying out the task with a professional attitude, explaining what he was doing and giving advise. He deserves a 5 star rating. Would recommend this company to others.",HomeServe
"Prompt, efficient service - shower tap sorted avoiding an expensive replacement - very grateful!",HomeServe
Homeserve was very helpful when I phoned them and reassured me that my claim has been acted upon.The plumber that attended very quickly to carry out a nivestigation of the water leak and set things in motion promptly which was very reassuring. The process of tracing the water leak and setting about to rectify the problem took a lot of worry off me and I was confident of a positive outcome through their professionalism in dealing with the significant water leak and follow up service. ,HomeServe
"My mum's manhole was blocked, as I was out of London I told my brother to call HomeServe as mum had plumbing, drainage and electrical home emergency cover with them. This he did and appt was booked. They came following day and cleared the blockage.  Job done..thanks.",HomeServe
Good pretty comprehensive insurance for plumbing cover.  Easy and simple application.,HomeServe
They have been out twice now to fix leaking pipes and the issue hasn't been resolved. 3rd time lucky soon. Make you sign a waiver which is pointless as they won't do work unless you sign it. Then leave you picking up the pieces once they gone in through the ceiling or floorboards. Sadly I'm stuck with them through my home insurance. So waiting to see if they can actually fix the problem finally. None of their staff wear ID so you're at a loss to know how qualified they actually are? I also get the impression that the staff get allocated too many jobs and are rushing by the time they start yours. My experience hasn't been great so far. On the plus side there's only so much plasterboard and floorboard they can remove so every time they come back the access is easier for them.,HomeServe
We called them for a plumbing issues and they checked and fixed it the following day. They work efficiently. It was sorted perfectly.,HomeServe
The plumber turned up on time was a very pleasant young man ,HomeServe
Set up plumbing cover online and was very easy to do and very quick. ,HomeServe

Got my toilet working after a terrible night with gastroenteritis.,HomeServe
"What a shambles of an organisation.I have a blocked toilet,my only one.Cancelled Wednesday appt as engineer ill,booked Friday but no one turned up or phoned.I phone them supposed to be here today.Engineer rang to say Jetter had broken then call centre called to say he had to go to an emergency in Leicester.I said to him at least get your excuses the same.They are rubbish.Keep well clear",HomeServe
"Called Homeserve out due to all of my external drains being completely backed up. He arrived on time and was very polite and efficient. After rodding the drains and showing me how far he had rodded he said the blockage was not on my property and I need to contact Thames Water. He told me exactly what to say and what keywords to use which made it much easier. He was spot on with his diagnosis, the problem was with the main sewers which Thames Water (Also very efficient) sorted out. Sorry I have forgotten your name but the call out was to TW19 (Wraysbury) on Tuesday 19th March, late morning. Thank you",HomeServe
"HomeServe had a really good offer of cover for water pipes & drains,which was really easy to sign up for.",HomeServe
"Not a company I will be renewing my cover with , even at a bargain price . There seems to be little , or no communication between admin. and the engineers sent out .They arrive ( if you are lucky ) , with no idea what they have been sent for , and ill equipped to deal with the problem , either in terms of the expertise or tools necessary . It took nine months , four visits and three different ' engineers' to replace a dripping stop tap .  A job that was eventually completed in ten minutes !Not an efficient , or profitable  way to run acompany . I spent Ã‚Â£60.00 on the excess charge on my policy , and was given Ã‚Â£50.00 compensation .The stress caused over what should have been a straightforward job cannot be compensated for .",HomeServe
Thank you- your guys came out and fixed my leaky tap. ,HomeServe
Easy to fill out and insure all my pipes ,HomeServe
Easy to use web interface simple to follow. Excellent offer for first years water/waste service pipes and household leaks thrown in.,HomeServe

Engineer came out on the same dayVery polite and helpfulUnfortunately could not locate the problem and recommended I call south staffs water who again could not locate where water running through the drainage pipe is coming from they did all necessary tests Overall all engineers have been very helpfulProblem still not solved ,HomeServe
Homeserve attended for two reasons. 1. Leaking toilet cistern and faulty flush mechanism. 2. Root blockage to cellar drain and sump.  The toilet cistern was still leaking after an earlier Homeserve visit in December 2024. Carpet now despoiled etc. the plumber did his best but failed to repair the flush. Another visit requested the following day. Flush mechanism now improved but by no means perfect. Floor still very damp.  Also the specialist drains team attended. I had been told that they would use a special machine to unblock the roots and would inspect with a camera. As it happened the specialist team declined to do anything and simply kept saying that they were in a hurry and had another job to go to. They couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use their equipment for whatever reason and I had to do the work myself. It was a failed visit.  I now have another provider coming tomorrow. etc. Alan L-S,HomeServe
Very helpful plumber reassured me that there were no more problems with my heating pipes. Can't remember exact date when he came earlier in the month. ,HomeServe

The engineer turned up on time at the appointment date.The blockage fortunately was fairly minor and swiftly dealt with.He also checked out an inspection drain to make sure there was no blockage down the line.,HomeServe
I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t praise Luke enough he was so kind and thoughtful.   I was so upset when he arrived with a burst pipe under the kitchen floor and Luke was so kind and helpful and assured me he would not leave until he had fixed the leak.  I could not believe it when he squeezed under the kitchen floor in mud and water to fix the leak.  He went above and beyond what I expected. I would give him 10 starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s if I could.  Kind regards Kim Caulfield ,HomeServe
The plumber turned up at the allotted time and totally changed the innards of the toilet cistern efficiently and without fuss. This not only sorted the original flush problem but also fixed the developing leakage issue. ,HomeServe

Very quick.  Plumbing now working better,HomeServe
I am delighted with Homeserve! The booking process is automated and works well and I was able to book a time slot to suit.I had two issues and booked two separate appointments. The same plumber attended both times and dealt with the issues efficiently by replacing a kitchen sink tap and subsequently a leaking pipe to the washing machine. The greatest benefit is knowing that someone qualified will actually turn up and fix issues. Worth every penny! Highly recommended. ,HomeServe
"I Can't thank engineer enough, I put a call in for leak on toilet thinking I also did one for hand basin,When he came I'd only logged one call out !! He repaired leak , also finding I had a leak on stop tap,  so I logged calls for hand basin and stop tap , next day same engineer came out repaired  and replaced parts needed, nothing was a bother to him very pleasant and helpful person.

"Called out to outside blocked drain. Nice young man came and tried to clear the drain but apparently the blockage was on neighbours side so couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it. They took my Ã‚Â£30 excess even though they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t solve the problem. I have now spoken to neighborurs and they have paid to clear the drain of which I have paid half, a further Ã‚Â£100. I complained to Homeserve and have received info to say they will get back to me. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still waiting! The problem may have been on my neighbours side but I still had to pay the excess even though I still had the problem. ",HomeServe

Called first time for a toilet blockage/drainage issue and the young  engineer (Louis) had no clue what he was doing and was buying his way out by flushing the toilet 2 times and said it's fine now.Very unprofessional and this engineer needs to be trained and show what customer service means.Rang again today morning because the problem is still there and was promised an engineer will come and still waiting.Very bad service.,HomeServe
"I found it very easy to book my appointment as it was a non urgent repair, no escaping water. My toilet cistern was not filling properly. I had to wait a few days which was no problem.

I was originally told a plumber would not be available untill Sunday between 8 and 6 but my only toilet was blocked and this was 9 o/c Saturday morning. After complaining that was too long to wait a  plumber came that same afternoonUnfortunately the power wash machine that was needed to flush the drain had just broken down but the plumber who was very pleasant and seemed very experienced managed to unblock the drain with a plunger However if he had not been able to unblock the drain with just the plunger I was told no one would be available untill sometime on the Monday and this was Saturday afternoonAs I only have one toilet I was quite worried that  I would have been expected to wait that long without the use of a toilet ,HomeServe

BEAWARE SCAMMERS!!! Homeserve is the worst company anyone could be with. I had a leaking ceiling which the engineer came to look on a Friday and told us we had to make access to the pipes (so had to do half the job our selfs) then made a hole in the kitchen ceiling and booked in for Saturday didn't turn up then rearranged for Monday called and said he couldn't turn up because he won't get home in time if he takes on our job so rearranged it with Homeserve again bearing in mind all the rearrangements of appointments was made without letting us know only when we was calling them to find out why the engineer didn't turn up they told us. Spoke to Homeserve earlier been guaranteed an engineer will be out by 10pm tonight and then they just sent a txt saying they have rearranged it for Thursday themselves. Absolute diabolical service. THEY KEEP MAKING YOU PAY ACCSES PAYMENTS BUT DONT DO THE JOB.   DO NOT GO WITH THEM PAY THE EXTRA AND GO ELSEWHERE.,HomeServe

Even though the toilet was not fixed on the first visit due to no part available, the next visit was arranged for next week and then it took him very quick to fix the leak. I forgot the name of the plumber but he was from Italy and he did a great job. I will definitely recommend this company.",HomeServe
1. Efficiently diagnosed first problem (toilet flush) and resolved it in minutes.2. Quickly replaced faulty expansion tank ballcock in loft which cured overflow into garden3.Diagnosed possible extra problem of [possible] overheating of hot water and advised me to mitigate risks by seeking advice of heating engineer to further test and adjust. This I did. Heating engineer agreed that a very slight reduction to heat settings at boiler and at storage tank was indicated. This was done and I feel now confident my C/H and hot water system are safer as a result.,HomeServe
"Happy that we got a quick appointment and they arrived on time, checked all the drains on our property and discovered the blockage was not on our premises and phoned the waterboard on our behalf.",HomeServe
"He was in to replace a leaking valve on the towel rail in our downstairs WC.The job itself was done OK, however he damaged the chrome surface of the connecting nut by not protecting it in any way, and he also used the nice towel from the rail to mop up dirty water which spilled out during the valve change-over, which we then had to wash.So he did an OK job, rather than a good job, hence three stars, but it wouldn't have taken much to have given us a better experience.",HomeServe
"Looked at the problem, but as it wasn't a leak through some selant in the shower he couldn't help.",HomeServe
"UPDATE....Hi AlexThank you for your prompt reply. True to your word, we had another visit today (so fast) and they did a fantastic job ! Another really lovely plumber that went above and beyond to fix the problem....even on a bank holiday ! An excellent service which is much appreciated Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’ many thanks.We had a blockage in-between the pipe work for our shower and bath causing the shower to fill up to the brim. The plumber arrived polite and cheerful and on time and proceeded to use his vacuum to fix the blockage. Unfortunately when we went to take a shower the next morning it was filling right up again. The problem was still there and it hadn't been cleared. Maybe we were just unlucky but it was our first call out and bit disappointing. Didn't want to pay out a second time. Back to taking very fast showers and the plunger !",HomeServe

"Phoned on 20th March '24 and said I believed I needed a plumber to visit who would probably need a camera to check out the problem with the bathroom loo. I was told that the plumber would visit and call a colleague with a camera, if needed. The appointment was scheduled for 8.00am to 6.00pm on Monday 25th March 2024 and I was advised the plumber would phone when on his way.I was up and about at 8.00am but didn't receive a call until the afternoon when the plumber, who arrived after 3.00pm, advised that he was on his way.Shortly after arrival the plumber said that he would need to remove the toilet and would need the assistance of a  colleague with a camera..... and he arranged for a colleague to join him on Wednesday 27th March '24 between 12 noon and 6.00pm. He said this should have been arranged when I made the original appointment.No-one arrived On the 27th. I sent a text to the plumber at circa 5.00pm to ask him to confirm that someone would be arriving but did not receive a response.The issue has not been resolved and up to now I have spent circa 13 hours waiting for someone to arrive without being given a more shorter window of likely arrival time (do they not have a schedule on the day based on which they could advise - ''it will be after lunch'' or similar)?",HomeServe

The engineer was professional and efficient. Quickly resolved the issue and recommended replacing the faulty taps (free of charge).Service went beyond our expectations,HomeServe
Plumber arrived when he said he would. Fixed fault with flushing mechanism and found associated problem which he also dealt with. Very happy with the outcome.,HomeServe
On the day of the appointment the guy rang me to say he was on his way and he sorted out my drain really quickly he was very nice and polite and he sorted out my blocked drain inside my garden gates and left everything as it was afterwards  so please tell him he was very good at his job x,HomeServe
Excellent service with minimal disruption. Sorted leak and replaced stopcock with an easier to operate lever valve. A first class plumber!,HomeServe
"This was a real joke. I reported a faulty tap outside before the pipe enters the house, explained the problem in the online system. They were very fast taking the Ã‚Â£30 excess. The engineers came a week later and spent less than 1 minute saying 'oh we can't repair that' and that I should call the water company. No mention of giving my Ã‚Â£30 back. The most unhelpful service I have ever seen. Do not go anywhere near HomeServe.",HomeServe
"They made sure all the blockage was removed from outside drain, so I no longer have a flood on the drive when emptying kitchen sink or washing machine",HomeServe

"Quick response. Very helpful, friendly and thorough engineers. Unusual plumbing situation which accounted for two visits being necessary to solve problem but one star below excellent because there did not seem much liaison between engineers",HomeServe
"What should have been a 15min job to fix leaking bath taps turned into an epic.  The discs were difficult to remove resulting in replacing the taps.  The engineers located replacement taps, retrieved and installed same day within my appointment time.  On testing all was well they found the pump had died, so they sourced, retrieved, installed the pump.  They also checked the shower was working.  This turned out to be an entire afternoon.  These guys were ROCKSTARS.  They could easily have jobbed the visit for another day but they didn't and stuck with issue upon issue.  No doubt you know i was most grateful.  No leaking taps and pump replacement made a world difference.  When you get service like this, it makes policy so much worthwhile.",HomeServe
"Gentleman arrived sooner than expected, following a quick call to confirm earlier availability, was directed at the leaking pipe and quickly fixed the issue. Great work.",HomeServe

"Apart from having more than one issue that needed attention and having to make a separate application for each the service from the engineer was very good.Also I was astonished that instead of replacing washers in 2 leaky taps that were perfectly okay, a whole new tap was provided for each.  Not only very costly but not very environmentally friendly either in my opinion.",HomeServe
"The engineer who fixed the  Shower room sink waste pipe/shower tray leak on two different appointments did a great job 8/03/24-11/03/24,many thanks.",HomeServe

"Homeserve came to repair a leak at my home early Sunday afternoon 21st Jan. 2024. I informed the Homeserve plumber that I required the central heating as I was 84 yrs. old and it was freezing outside. I was not informed of the choices and if I wanted to be without central heating. Polygon had already found the leak and exposed it in the concrete floor ready for Homeserve to repair it. Polygon had already informed Homeserve what materials would be required for them to make the repair. As soon as he arrived he said that he was unable to make the repair as he did not have the parts necessary and as his wholesaler was no longer open he would have to return tomorrow. I offered to go and pay for the parts necessary and he told me that it was not allowed, shook my hand, said sorry and left all within 10-15 mins. He did not seem to be interested in making the repair. The leak got worse and I telephoned Homeserve at approx. 2:00 a.m. I was told that there was no plumber available but eventually they agreed and a Homeserve plumber arrived at 2:45 a.m. approx. By this time I had tripped, fell and broke my eye socket while emptying one of many buckets of water. The Homeserve plumber, on seeing my face, said that it was a criminal offence, his words not mine, for anyone who had left an 84yr. old man with a water leak. It took him approx 30 mins to complete the repair. He telephoned for an ambulance and I went to the hospital at at 4;00 a.m. approx. I am very upset with Homeserve and disappointed at the whole episode.  ",HomeServe
Lovely plumber turned up in a timely manner and fixed my issue. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very happy.,HomeServe
Pay for plumbing and drainage cover and just requested a call out for a radiator not working.   Apparently it's one of the things not covered.  I just find with these companies they don't cover the things that you really need.  ,HomeServe
"As an 82 year old gentleman, last week we had Ashley Wilson, Plumber did a magnificent job for us. We feel he is a credit to your company, the service he provided has reinforced my desire to remain with Homeserve ..",HomeServe
Great communication and leak was repaired. Very informative young man who did his job well. ,HomeServe
"Arranging a visit was easy by phone, speaking to a real person. The plumber was delayed but contacted us to notify of the delay. Plumber then phoned when he was on his way (earlier than expected). Diagnosed the leak quickly and although unable to replace the cracked 40yr old cistern, helped my v old mother to find a replacement on-line and told her what to order, also reassured her. Would have been a 5star review if everything resolved in one visit. Thank you",HomeServe
The Plumber was on time and carried out the work required in clean tidy manner.  Friendly chap who was easy to chat with.  Left having cleared up after himself what more can you ask for.,HomeServe
"It took a while for a plumber to come out, which meant we had 3 weeks of sewerage coming up through our drains.The man who came was very helpful",HomeServe
"Friendly plumber, quick diagnosis and remedy ",HomeServe
"The company misleads and wastes your time. I contacted them regarding a leaking tap. However, when the engineer arrived, he declared that he couldn't repair the specific tap and left, offering no indication of a refund for the appointment's excess fee.",HomeServe
"The man from Home serve did a great job as he had to work hard to remove a sink that was grouted in, in order to get to the tap.He replaced the tap and waste. Good job done.",HomeServe
The guy who came out to us was awesome. Lee Whieldon Drainage EastOur drains were rammed to the brimHe did an amazing job it took a while but he got it looking like new then cleaned all  the area for us. Up and running smoothly. What a great professional person. Credit to the company. Well done Home Serve.,HomeServe
The provision of a new toilet was carried out very efficiently and is working very well.  Impressed by service given by staff and the concession they gave to me as a 90 year old,HomeServe

Plumber arrived on timeRang me ten minutes before he arrived,HomeServe
Reporting our fault of outdoor drainage problems was easy to do. Our homeServe appointment was made for within 24hours. We received a call on the Saturday from their representative informing us he would be coming within the next hour. He arrived on time and was immediately onto trying to solve our blocked drain problem. He was friendly and kept us informed of his progress. When finished he updated us and said if any further problems he would be writing up notes on any further actions required. All well after 2.5 weeks thank you.,HomeServe
"The source of the leak was not identified correctly,and the problem was still there after the plumber had left.I have had to get a private plumber to do the job.",HomeServe
"Plumber came to establish / repair water leak.

Engineer arrived true to time and clearly was an expert in the field of pumps.It wasn't entirely straightforward but he coped very well with the problems. Although the work took longer than he expected he was calm and assuring throughout. All works fine now.,HomeServe
I joined homeserve drain cover for peace of mind knowing all my plumbing and service pipe would be covered if anything goes wrong and at Ã‚Â£6 pounds for the first year what a great deal and it was so easy to apply online the website is very easy to navigate ,HomeServe
You will not clear a shared drain. It didn't use to be an issue and you have cleared it in the past. If you have changed your policy you didn't tell me when you charged me the Ã‚Â£160 annual fee. It should have been made clear to me then and it wasn't. ,HomeServe
Prompt appointment time.  Professional and efficient plumber,HomeServe
"Polite, on time. On the second visit the umber offered to change the flushing system which improved things greatly.",HomeServe
"Had a leak with water dripping into the kitchen from the shower in the bathroom, the visit from your engineer given a window of between 08.00 and 18.00 he eventually arrived at 16.00, looked at the shower said it wasn't a plumbing problem that it was a leak from a seal, that my opposition's cover seals, was here about 5 minutes, not a very happy chappie",HomeServe
"Didn't even cost me a phone call! One online typed conversation later, the plumber was booked for day/date/time. Brilliant service.",HomeServe

The guys were friendly, courteous and tenacious - and they wouldn't close the job until they were happy it was perfect. I also appreciated how they communicated throughout the stages and plan to fix the problem. Overall, I was very happy and impressed with the service. Only lost a star because we had to wait almost a week for the first appointment. After that, they guys arranged the follow ups. ",HomeServe
"I had a leaking pipe which was flooding my living room and soaking my floorboards.  I spoke to the Homeserve contact on the phone, relaying that this was an emergency but was given an appointment in a week.  I had to challenge this repeatedly to get it expedited.  The plumber was late, and then when he finally got in touch, he had arrived at the wrong address  - Homeserve then tried to cancel the appointment, for a plumber to be sent out another day!  I had to fight for the appointment not to be cancelled and delayed further.  The plumber stopped the leaking, and was told that someone from Homeserve would be in touch to fix the problem - this never happened.",HomeServe
A timely response on this occasion and effective action taken by your contracted engineer to repair leaking pipework. ,HomeServe
Appalling.  Still waiting for drain cover to be fixed 3 months later.  Claimed it was the responsibility of Thames Water.  Thames Water says it was the responsibility of Homeserve.  Waste of time having insurance if they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take responsibility for anything.,HomeServe
"I want to stress my concerns I have purchased a Drainage & plumbing policy from (Home serve Membership Limited) I had a pipe leaking which is under a flooring in order to do so Home serve would need to break my floor to access to fix the leak in their T&C page 2 in the Reinstatement section it says Repairs to put right any damage we have made to an area during a repair (Such as a section of lawn,tarmac,paving concrete,soil,internal flooring and internal plasterwork-They are refusing to adhere to there T&S I complained and my complaint was not upheld instead I have asked to take my complaint to Financial Ombudsman-In my eyes they are not partial I suggest to check Trust Pilot page on there review's I then asked if Home serve belong to ADR they gave me the details but refuses to enter the process may I ask why they are refusing what have they got to hide ? Its very disappointing the way I have been treated by Home serve   Will I be assisted in an honest way ? I have today had Louise this is how she addresses my complaint ... I am very sorry you feel unhappy with the outcome of your complaint.This has now been reassessed and we are unable to change our decision.A letter has now been sent in the post to you and please also find this attached - I am following the complaint Do not want to go to ADR I ask why > Todays response ...

"Plumber turned up promptly, pleasant and respectful. Clearly focussed in providing a positive and lasting solution despite being a tricky fault to repair. He worked quickly and cleanly, and left with a lasting solution.",HomeServe
"Leaking stop tap..because I am 89 yrs old& vulnerable, the engineer came same night & repaired it..I was very grateful.",HomeServe
"Initially an appointment to fix what I thought was a leaking pipe was made for three days ahead, I explained to the call handler that as a large household I could not turn the water off for three days. Fortunately an engineer was then booked  for the following day. The engineer sorted the problem quickly and efficiently. I would not be without this policy from Homeserve. It is excellent value and brings peace of mind when things go wrong.",HomeServe

Seemed to work but this week again a bit slow in flushing. Having seen what he did I repeated the process, this time using my power washer and a large paper type blockage came through.Would have preferred not to have done this and he been better prepared, or even used my washer it would have been sorted first time",HomeServe
We had an issue with our toilets blocking having called Home serve on a weekend! They arranged for a contractor to attend although this did not happen the same day as promised we did get a phone call apologising for the delay- The engineer arrived on the Sunday and sorted the issue. Engineer was friendly and very effiicient. Worth the money if you have an Emergency,HomeServe
I have to say the first engineer that came did not complete the job and I had to call the office for another bad leak the bathroom was flooded the second engineer was superb and sorted the job in no tir,HomeServe
One top on the kitchen mixer tap had broken and a repair I'd had done previously had not worked. The engineer came and replaced the complete tap for me with one that looks really good and works very well. Very pleased with everything. ,HomeServe
"The engineer was very polite and thorough, went out of his way to be helpful and get the job done.  The job was a blocked bath waste and sink waste, which were adjacent to each other and went into the same soil pipe.  The only slightly questionable thing was that I had to pay an excess for each of these, although I would have thought it was the same blockage in the pipe.  But overall good.",HomeServe
The plumber was very professional and replaced our leaky taps in no time. Was very friendly,HomeServe
"An appointment was made fir tge drainer to attend my house, we were told they would be there between Saturday and Wednesday,  we stayed in the house waiting for the drainer to attend. We received a phone call on Wednesday at 8.30.pm to say they would not be attending as they had a backlog of appointments, I asked when the found out there was a backlog and if they could have informed me sooner,  the customer services operative then put the phone down on me. I phoned again and was told the drainer could attend on Friday unfortunately it was my brother in laws funeral that day so the appointment was set for Monday. The drainer attended but did not have the correct equipment as his drain van was being repaired. A further appointment was made for I think Wednesday, the drainer arrived and tried to clear the blockage but could not , he then got in touch with united utilities who then eventually came and cleared the drain.The first person to attend was a plumber who said the problem could be ground water and he could not do anything, the second person to attend checked for leaks from the mains water but said there were none and he would contact the drain team , I think the plumber shoukd have contacted the drain team first as they identified straight away that it was and external drain problem as tge water under the floor was foul water .",HomeServe
"I had a leak reviewed but the problem reappeared a week later so I had a repair again (which resolved the issue), but I paid a second excess charge. Despite letting customer service know of the issue over three weeks ago and speaking to home serve on the phone, this has never been resolved. The email response says 5 working days but I have been waiting over three weeks.",HomeServe

"This company is very generous : it made a very special offer which is very encouraging - no one wants a plumber  [ so to say ]  but it is just in case.Unfortunately, but very understandable and very clever is their CEO to make an excess - which saves people just using them andalso, it generates rightful income for their firm, so their CEO is very clever and reasonable with a small excess which is powerful enough to deter people using them and costing them while it generates income each week.It is also good because they give you the option to be automatically renewed or not.For me, I wish the excess were zero, of course.",HomeServe
The repair to the reported leak in our sink took three visits by your technician to resolve.It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t clear to me why the repair was so complicated although your representative did keep me informed at each stage what parts he needed and when he would return to carry out the work.,HomeServe
I have raised a complaint and detailed the issues. It has been almost a month since I have raised a claim and the leaking pipe has not been fixed yet. So far there were TWO Ã¢â‚¬Ëœno turn upsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - bookings were made for them to fix the pipe but fail to turn up and even no calls to say they were not able  to come.  Very Frustrating to say the least. ,HomeServe
We had engineers in to repair our toilet. Arriving on time with a call to let us know the loo was fixed. However there was a problem later the same day which we reported. After a no show for another plumber due to being sent to the wrong address the loo was quickly fixed the next day. The problem was no oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fault so very happy with the service. ,HomeServe
"I called to make a new claim, a flexi pipe leak, spoken to a machine of course. Paid the Ã‚Â£30 excess. Plumber came and stir at it for 15 mins, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch anything, just watched the leak coming out of it and said NOT COVERED.`Pity, there were no humans behind the new claim phone, the machine didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell me it was not covered. Only they care about is taking the money and than telling you not covered. Make sure the claim you make is covered before paying the excess.",HomeServe
I have an outside leak.  First engineer sent said not his remit to look for source so arranged a second visit for weeks later. That was cancelled the evening before (losing me a days pay) and rescheduled. When he eventually came he just checked water meter which was fine and said Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnot his remit to look for leaksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and he would send a Leak Detection team. Waited more weeks and who turns up? The same Engineer as before FFS. Again checked water meter - god knows why - then left saying Ã¢â‚¬ËœCanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢! Apart from poking a stick into the huge puddle and saying Ã¢â‚¬Ëœooo air bubblesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t offer any other help. Meanwhile I have a small lake now Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Cancelled my auto renewal. ,HomeServe
Arrived in the time specified. Was polite and friendly. Fixed my leaking tap in minutes. Would highly recommend ,HomeServe
"I have always been a fan of Homeserve but not so much now.   I was having my worktop changed along with a sink and tap.   However it was thennoticed that our soil pipe was cracked and the crack went underground.   We had two visits from Homeserve and a visit from a drainage chap all within the week.   (All very friendly)However the drainage company took a few days for the quote And then by the time Homeserve approved it two weeks had gone by.  All this time I was without running water, a sink and a worktop as such  and couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use washing machine.   We then got a date for three weeks later for the drainage company to come out. (So this meant five weeks using a bucket for washing up and getting friends and family to do our washing)  I asked if they could get another firm and was told by the time we had another survey and they got the parts in (liner for the pipe) it would be approx the same time scale.  Hmmm ok I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t accept that.  I phoned a local firm and they came out same day surveyed it and then came out three days later to fix it at a cost of Ã‚Â£1008 to myself    I was told the complaints section would contact me within 10 days ",HomeServe
"Awful, leak took 4 visits to fix - so much mess.  No flexible time despite emergency.  Provide visits after 6 but no way to fix as shops shut!!! ",HomeServe
"The service was really good, a gentleman came out on the first day and tried to clear the blockage but told me he didn't have a jet spray but would try to sort it. He came back to say it needed a jet spray so had booked another man to come out. A guy came the next day and sorted it out. ",HomeServe
"Plumber was experienced, competent and repaired the leak quickly. He was friendly and explained clearly the issue we had and how he would fix it. ",HomeServe

"I was not very impressed with a person who come to see the job , he used my plunger , he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bring anything to do the job apart from a light torch , anyway with a few attempts he clear the problem , I was not strong enough,to do the job ,the good thing he come the same day . Good job the office done .",HomeServe
"We were very worried about an unidentified leak we had (somewhere) on the main water pipe onto our property. Fortunately we have an appropriate Home Serve policy (!)Home Serve were superb from start to finish - we made an online application which started an easy to understand process . On the day , the two operatives were friendly , knowledgable , reassuring and v hard working. They went that ' extra mile ' with their excavation, in order to prove that liability would lay with Thames Water ; taking a video of the leak and transferring it to us digitally.  They were brilliant.",HomeServe
A little disappointed with the engineer that turned up. He said his van had broken down and most of his equipment was in it. Although he cleared the blockage Im not over confident with it as he only had a plunger and not even a hosepipe.,HomeServe
Every aspect of this resolution could not have been better but the main response was the way in which the Plumber could not have done better in how he resolved it!Ours was about the 4th response he had dealt with and given the nature of the task he realised it would take a further 2 hours or so to complete it!Based on the manner in which he dealt with getting it resolved couldn't have been better and though I tried to acknowledge this previously I had to phone through to the company and wanted to ensure Management were aware of the brilliant  resolution I had received and that he should be awarded the top score of 9 with all the questions,HomeServe
"The plumber that came out had been previously as we have had a number of issues with our toilet. Once again he was knowledgeable and spotted the problem straight away, he gave advice going forward as we are replacing it due to ongoing issues when the house was built. We were without water overnight as the emergency plumber could not make it to us until the following day but we were kept informed and advised to turn off the water and put towels down. I have always found thd service to be efficient and wouldn't be without it now so much so I have recommended it to family and friends ",HomeServe

I must say the two home serve employees Jeremy and Oliver who came to fix our water leak were excellent. They were professional and helpful throught out their Time they were at our property in Redditch they cleaned up all the mess when they had finished it was when it was raining heavily and there was a lot of mud. I know it's a long review but I feel we seem to be in a complaining culture so I have had to praise Ã°Å¸â€˜Â  an excellent job. Thank you both.,HomeServe
My main drain got blocked. They need to do 3 visit but they fixed it,HomeServe
"Recently joined home serve and he 2 plumbing jobs recently which both were not done properly. For one leakage 3 engineers attended at different times and messed it up, causing self a big leakage in the roof and broke the tiles and toilet seat which was not fixed. When called office they do not take responsibility of any damage caused by them so very hopeless. I will not recommend them at all and waiting for my policy to end as paying for nothing. Recent leakage has not been fixed and I am scared to call as worried if they cause any other damage ",HomeServe
We got our leaky tap replaced without any bother. The engineer was polite and informative and we were very happy with the result. ,HomeServe

Today the engineers turned up as expected and we hope they have done a good job.  They tidied up the garden to the best of their ability on a very soggy day and washed the mud off the drive.  We can only hope that the water leak is now fixed. They were pleasant and worked well.  ,HomeServe

"So far I have had 3 visits from and engineer, with another one booked for tomorrow. All to resolve a leaking tap. The replacement taps are of poor quality, as are the connecting tap tails. The issue now is leaking from the tap tail joints rather than the taps. The engineers who attend are pleasant but say that the components are of poor quality and they are often called back to jobs for taps. I think you need to invest in some better equipment as I feel that when this is eventually resolved I may not continue with this cover.",HomeServe
"Easy to contact and a excellent service from the office , a quick response to our problem (leaky pipe )The engineer was excellent quickly found the leak , repaired it and left it looking like no one had been there , fantastic and a great job done , thank you one and all .",HomeServe

"Our loo was blocked, the first plumber identified the blockage, but couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t free it. Several days later, the next plumber cleared it in less than two minutes?CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember the exacts dates, but was four five weeks ago",HomeServe
"Excellent service. Plumber arrived on time, was very professional, did a thorough job and was polite and friendly. I have every faith in the job done.Having cover means peace of mind, knowing I don't have the hassle of finding a tradesperson if a problem occurs.",HomeServe
Can not believe how quickly they arrived.  The job was completed efficiently s quickly.  The plumber polite ans helpful ,HomeServe
"Booked an appointment, paid excess, waiting all day for an engineer to come and assess a leak we have uncovered behind the wall. At 16.30 they text to say the appointment has been cancelled and they will refund me. What is the point of having the policy if you cannot send out engineers for emergencies - it is precisely why we purchased it. Avoid ",HomeServe
Engineer quickly identified where my water leak was coming from. It took some time to repair and he did a good job and cleaned up well before he left. Wore shoe covers to protect floors.,HomeServe
Managed to sort out our leak in kitchen,HomeServe
I reported the problem around 1000 in the morning and by 1020 I had a phone call from a plumber to say he was on his way. By 1200 all work was complete. I was astonished how fast it all happened considering it involved digging through concrete to reveal the leak. ,HomeServe
"He came on time to attend to my dripping cold water tap in my kitchen. It had been put in brand new last July and had been constantly dripping, now getting worse. He detected a faulty cartridge and replaced both the hot and cold ones. No dripping, fantastic work! ",HomeServe
"My dislike was having to wait 3 days for plumber. If we hadn't been able to locate leak under bath and stop it the result could have been catastrophic. However I could not say anything wrong about the guy who came to fix the problem. He was tidy, courteous and helpful.Also the lady I spoke to on the phone was very good. ",HomeServe
"I have been insured for three years. Last week, I had to claim for the first time. The process was painless and quick, the service engineer arrived on time and fixed my taps with no issues. I am very happy with the service provided.",HomeServe
"Service was quick, easy, affordable and informative.  The plumber was knowledgeable, and quickly identified the source of the leak and was able to solve the problem very rapidly.  He was helpful, engaging and gave fantastic advice.",HomeServe
"Homeserve responded immediately to a blocked drain problem.  The on-line chatbox style booking system is clearly in an early stage of development and should be ""road tested"" properly then improved.  However, the engineer, Dave arrived on time, was courteous and fixed the problem quickly. ",HomeServe
"The young service man was very polite, and friendly and kept to his job restoring my toilet system.  He did a thorough job and a great repair. I was very happy with the service.I forget the exact date he came it was within the past two weeks before the 10 of April 24.",HomeServe
Excellent service from plumber,HomeServe
"I used HomeServe to unblock my drain. They booked me an appointment for 3 days after my call. I could not use my washing machine, shower or dish washer as I feared the drain would overflow. The company they out sorted the work to did not turn up on the day they booked as they said there was an emergency they had to deal with. (This wasted my whole day & the drain was blocked for over 4 days) However they came early the following morning & the drain was cleared in 5 minutes. Although this was very frustrating I was relieved to see the drain cleared.",HomeServe
"Good service (as ever) once plumber eventually arrived - not acceptable to book a morning appointment and plumber not arrive until 4pm: once work was completed an hour later whole day was lost as had to stay in waiting, plans ruined ",HomeServe
"Though the people who came and did the actual work were great the actual process could improve.  When I report the problem I assume, which clearly I shouldn't,  that the engineer knows what the problem is when I have actually rang and told homeserve what the problem is. Each time they cam they didn't know the actual issue. The first guy said he couldn't actually do that type of job so could not fix the problem,  (blocked drain)so I had another 24 hour delay,  the 2nd guy came, he couldn't  fix it either BUT said he could get a plumber the same day which he did, but really when someone rings and tells you the issue why isn't the correct person sent or at least why are the engineers told the jobs they are going to be sent to??",HomeServe
The plumber and Electrician were professional. Explained the issue and were determined to resolve the issues. Plumber has to come back another day and complete. CONFIDENTALITY will renew the policy.,HomeServe
I had a leak in my kitchen ceiling from my bathroom.A homeserve plumber came that same day bashed two holes in the ceiling worked out what was the cause but couldn't do the repair as it was a 2 person job.3 days later 2 plumbers came and using an angle grinder made some neat  square holes 20x30cm and 50x50 cm.They did the repair tidied up and now I have 2 inspection holes which I've got to make good but they will give me access to the bathroom plumbing from my kitchen!,HomeServe
"I am disabled and had a water leek, phoned in at 9am and your plumber was here at 12noon as stated.  Pleasant man who even *Hoovered"" up the water and cleaned up after the job was done.   Your Plumber is a round peg in a round hole.  Thank you very muchFIVE STAR SERVICE.",HomeServe
I was very pleased with the speed of the appointment. Your chap was delightful. My problem is that I had an expensive tap that was leaking. I was offered a replacement tap which at the time I thought was a good idea. Unfortunately the new tap is a cheap and when it's turned off dribbles quite a bit of water every time. This will now cost me more in water bills than a dripping tap! I therefore feel cross about this and will have to get a plummer in to fix a new tap costing more money. Really not happy,HomeServe
"Fantastic service from start to finish, water leak from main pipe,Underground Leak identified, dug up made safe and secured, area all concreted back over, all done within 2 days, and Andy who did the job, well what a credit to the company he is, on his hands and knees for hours and always kept smiling and positive, well done if your not with Homeserve you are definitely missing out.",HomeServe

"A surface water drain had blocked and flooded the garden.  The Homeserve man arrived promptly and cleared the accumulation of roots with the onboard blaster and much personal delving in the manhole,  leaving the drain free-running.  He was very professional and had obviously done this before!",HomeServe
"I was suffering a very serious leak and in touch with South West Water throughout, Homeserve surveyed the problem for me and then sent a team of two to solve it. Excellent plumbing engineers both, Andrew and Daren cut out the leak and ran new pipes etc. I had been losing up to half a cubic metre a day now I am losing nothing at all. Friendly helpful service from the Customer Service to the engineers, I recommend Homeserve Insurance to all who want peace of mind with regard to possible plumbing and drainage issues. A tip though, when phoning for help, ignore robots and wait to be connected to a human as robots are restrictive in their options and can't answer queries. 10 out of 10.     ",HomeServe
"A good response to our leak,  quickly resolved by your plumber.  Thank you",HomeServe
Very easy to get in touch for a claim and a quick appointment.   Had taps completely replaced (included in the claim) by a very competent an professional man.   Nothing was too much trouble. ,HomeServe

"Had a leak in the bathroom which damaged our kitchen ceiling as it poured through since the morning on Eid day :(An independent plumber we know came and told us itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a leak under the bathroom floorboards. He quoted us a silly amount which we were hesitant on, and had pondered on turning off our mains overnight until we could find another plumber to quote us.Luckily, we called Aviva who brought Homeserve out. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t catch the Homeserve plumberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name but he was an absolute gentleman who found the leak (it was above the floorboards, one of the pipes from the toilet cistern) within a minute and solved it within the time it takes to park a car. From the first call, it was all solved within 40 minutes.Thank you Aviva and HomeServe for solving our issue, we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t thank you enough for the peace of mind and assurance you have provided us today!P.S Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe children are falling through the ceilingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€š",HomeServe
"The technician who came to fix the problem, a broken pipe, was excellent. He was so helpful and he worked like a trojan on his own to make sure the job got finished. I cannot speak highly enough of him and he kept us informed of progress throughout. We also needed to call out Bournemouth Water to fix the meter box and he waited patiently for them to assist in the process. Very grateful to him.",HomeServe
Nice and helpful engineer but still have a bath drainage problem,HomeServe
"The service I received recently was brilliant. Quick on line chat to make sure my issue was covered, claim made via the app and the engineer came out on the same day and fixed the problem. I paid an excess of Ã‚Â£30 and my annual premium is around Ã‚Â£170. And emergency plumber would have cost more than these combined ",HomeServe
"We had a problem with the main drainage of the house. A quick call to Homeserve booked an engineer visit. He arrived on time, understood the problem.

Excellent job of replacing kitchen tap quick clean service by technician,HomeServe
We had 3 visits. All your engineers were pleasant and helpful. The first engineer did not check in the loft because he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn off the water as we had a seized stopcock. We did follow his advice to get a water engineer to clear the manhole in the pavement so the water could be turned off.  The second engineer did check the hot tank in the loft and relieved the situation temporarily. He advised us to contact our gas/electric provider which we did. The third visit was from a very friendly engineer who sorted out the stopcock seizure. Generally good but I would have preferred a little more of a proactive approach at the start. ,HomeServe
The work was carried out and completed professionally I was notified time of arrival and plumber arrived as he said he would . The work completed was excellent. I do however have a disappointment which is I wanted 2 jobs to be done and when I booked was told that my excess for each job would be Ã‚Â£30  which is a total of Ã‚Â£60 for one call out which I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford therefore having to wait another month to get the next job paid My point is while I understand the excess could it not be that  if 2 small jobs like mine for example seized taps and a small pipe leak that the second job be given at half price rather than make the customer wait another month for repair because it couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be afforded therefore the cost of call-out would be Ã‚Â£45 not Ã‚Â£60 and as someone who has paid into the policy for many years would help to keep the customer ,HomeServe
"Drain blockage removed quickly, after the arrival was a little before the 12-6 period promised, which was fine.",HomeServe

"We had properly blocked drains which meant we were unable to shower or flush loos. Called Homeserve Emergency on Monday and the automated service could only give me an appointment for Friday.  This meant we had to move out of our home. It shouldn't be billed as an Emergency service.  That said, the technician who came out was very helpful and gave us good advice to avoid it happening again.  (Our home had been empty for almost 4 months which had caused residual substances in the drain to harden and block and then we had the whole family staying at once, resulting in a blockage).",HomeServe
Excellent job done in repairing our leaking radiator pipe. ,HomeServe
"Prompt service in dealing with a blocked sewer manhole.  However, rather surprised that an ordinary plumber with rods turned up, rather than someone with a specialist van, equipped with a (more effective) powered water jet and washing facilities (like Dyno-rod).  It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem very hygienic that someone who has been clearing a sewer may well go next to an internal plumbing job without having on-van washing facilities.",HomeServe

"My drinking water needed something replacing inside it as the thread had gone. I explained that to the first person I spoke to. She then passed me on to a gentleman. I automatically thought she had told him all I told her. No I had to say it all again and I really cannot remember if I said a drinking tap. They sent a lovely plumber who took 1 look and said we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch those! So I bought a tap Ã‚Â£40 and paid Ã‚Â£60 for a plumber to fit it, why do I pay insurance?",HomeServe

Someone came out and resolved my plumbing issue within a couple of hours of me phoning. The guy was very pleasant and efficient.

"I had a blocked toilet - They offerred an appointment 2 days away.  When I protested one 5 hours later which they cancelled.  Then offerred one the next morning at 8 am - he turned up at 11 & couldn't resolve it.  Signified a blocked drain and they couldn't get anyone for 48 hours.  So 72 hrs without a toilet with a housebound family member is acceptable. 3 hours on the phone - won't pay for a hotel, won't call out a sub contractor.  I asked to speak to a supervisor to be told one would contact me within 24 hours.  48 hours later I am still waiting.   Just as well I called out a local company who attended within the hour & sorted the problem.  Guess what - Home Serve that Ã‚Â£60 odd a month I pay you as Insurance - you can wave goodbye to it.

"The Homeserve call out service is good! The plumber I booked responded quickly and on time, with a curtesy call ahead of his arrival. He identified the problems quickly and fixed one and got a colleague to attend to fix the second. The second visit was much the same, quick to respond and fixie the problem. The star knocked off is mainly for the customer services tactics employed. Which is a fantastic value introductory rate (if you pay more than a Ã‚Â£1 a month for your first year youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re being done over), followed by a price hike in year two! While the full price is still good value if you use the call out service the increase in price still stings. ",HomeServe
"Plumber rang 30 minutes ahead of his visit, as promised. On arrival viewed the problem and informed me of his concerns as of the state of said pipe work and asked my permission to proceed.

"We reported a leak within a cavity wall requesting assistance for leak detection.  We have had a leak in the past and pulled out our bathroom to find the leak was caused by a burst pipe in the eves the water had run across the beams.  We were looking to avoid the same unnecessary inconvenience.  The engineer arrived on time when ask did he have a a camera to get in between the cavity wall the answer was no, asked if had any leak monitoring kit the answer was no.  I asked could he call the office for a request for the leak detection team to come out as apparently there are only 10 devices in the company across the country.  The office told him no he needed to make access holes in and around our shower to check for the leaks.I asked would he make the holes right correct any damage.  It appears homeserv can destroy a perfectly working bathroom with no recourse to correct the damage because they are busy with the leak detection kit else where.  No options were offered for revisitWould I renew the answer is a definite NO talking to colleges they too have had similar experiences If I could submit a 0 star I would WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annoying my wife had renewed by accident. Our previous encounter was engineers came to site and left us with the same leak with a promise to return with the correct kit.  They never did leaving me to fix that problem myself having only just come out of hospital with surgery which we relaid back to the support desk and by emailIf you need a washer changed may this is a company to use my experience nothing positive to say Following the homeserve response trivialising there poor service i fill compelled to up date the review i made.I can confirm again the engineer was not given consent to knock holes through the shower as its Homeserve policy to fix a leak,  but not repair any damage created whilst investigating the repair.  An access hole was provided along by the said shower,  as the engineer didnt come with the appropriate tools he was unable to see into the void. We have since put a camera into the provide void and can clearly see there is no leak behind the shower. We can still here water movement through the pipe which stops when mains is turned off.  What this demonstrates is that it was prudent not to consent to the engineer knocking holes blindly.  As already stated we have used Homeserve before, where they left us with a leak and no feedback via their  support channel hence making feedback in public.More than happy for homeserve to make contact and arrange for a suitably tooled leak detector and camera engineer to attend site.",HomeServe
"""Automated"" fault reporting was easy. Impressed that a BOT worked. Plumber arrived earlier than advised. Sadly couldn't resolve the issue but escalated the problem. The ""B"" team arrived next morning and unblocked sewage downpipe. Thank you.",HomeServe

it was easy to report.The plumber turned up and fixed the fault on the same day i rang.,HomeServe

We were impressed by the efficient way the repair to our toilet was booked and how the engineer dealt with the issue. All together the service was brilliant. ,HomeServe

Quick response to a leaking pipe that was damaging my property.The plumber attended within two hours on Easter Sunday.

"Homeserve had to send two different people to help, a plumber to replace our stopcock and a water engineer to deal with the leak. Both professionals did the jobs well, but we had to wait about a week to have the leak fixed with massive water loss. The bill was over Ã‚Â£3,000! Fortunately, Anglian Water didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t charge us for all of it.",HomeServe
"Thomas rang and came on time , excellent work ethic and suggests whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the best option of a plumbing problem.",HomeServe
The plumber was very good he did the job quickly and left no mess ,HomeServe
Really prompt and polite service. Just waiting for a follow up investigation of the drains to confirm what caused the problem. Excelant,HomeServe
It took three plumbers to resolve our blockage. Basically because two of them didn't have the right equipment i.e. a long enough snake rod. Plus we waited in for two days with no show. Also we were charged twice for one call out.,HomeServe
Problem returned within 2 days had to wait 4 days for seven trent to come & fix they said you just moved blockage further down pipe & you should have checked with a camera They cleared it & checked all pipes with cameras Thanks,HomeServe
It was only a dripping tap but easy to book. Great communication. Efficient and friendly service. ,HomeServe
"Engineers are of the highest level and tend to nail the problem and leave the place spotless. The only setback was that I had 2 problems and couldn't book them online together. I ended up with 2 engineers who arrived at different times. They both resolved the problems, a blocked downstairs loo and a leaking tap.",HomeServe
Charged me my Ã‚Â£30 excess just to tell me I wasn't covered for a shared drain ,HomeServe
"Was able to arrange appointment for repair at a time to suit me around work. Plumber rang me to give me an eta, and was very pleasant and efficient, repair was done in 15 mins.",HomeServe

What a credit he is to Homeserve! Tremendous service. Thanks Samuel Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬",HomeServe
Dripping tap repaired promptly and efficiently. Friendly and courteous service.,HomeServe
"I would have preferred to speak to a person from the very beginning of my call, however I did get to speak to one in the end.The plumber had to come back the same day as the leak was not repaired the first time which was a a bit annoying.Its all good now and reassuring that I can get someone out in a reasonable time.",HomeServe
The plumber came in good time nd spent about an hour and a half with me trying to solve the problem.  He did his best to try to find out what the problem was.,HomeServe
"Absolutely amazing, I suffer from serious mental health issues and mobility issues, tradesmen give me so much anxiety I make do rather than call someone out.However when the toilet and shower are backed up I had no choice we, the two guys that attended today went above and be beyond. One of the guys outside with the waste pipe got covered in ****, I felt so embarrassed and so bad, but he was just excellent made me totally comfortable. I would recommend HomeServe UK to everyone, today although stressful was helped by the superb representatives of HomeServe UK.Also want to mention the call staff who were also very kind.",HomeServe
"The problem = a constantly running toilet flush - arose suddenly on 27/24 and seemed serious to us as we were afraid of being flooded. HomeServe came to assess the problem speedily and ordered the necessary part, which was delivered on 03/04/24. The engineer came next day, 04/04/24, and fitted the new part, and the problem was solved. Everything was done calmly, promptly, and tidily, which we much appreciated: we did not have any mess to clear up after HomeServe's work.",HomeServe
Plumbers came to my house and solved the problem with no fuss and minimum disruption.,HomeServe
Lovely bloke careful of my plants but the pipe is clearly disfunctional throughout the garden he had to come twice and make two repairs Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ it is silly to have an insurance policy which does not allow the whole pipe to be repaired even though this is clearly what is required!,HomeServe
"Disappointing. Leak from feed to the shower. Engineer saidÃ¢â‚¬Â we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch showers, canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help youÃ¢â‚¬Â.He did however put a spanner on a nut and tighten it a little which was good of him. Decent chap, very pleasant.Rather a waste of the Excess I paid.",HomeServe
Even though it turned out the engineer that came out to us for a burst pipe couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help us as our insurance wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover anything he was so friendly and helpful . Have nothing but good to say about him . He helped us with information about cover from homeserve for the future and gave us information about sorting the problem ourselves ,HomeServe
"The first guy that came out was not very helpful, blamed it on condensation - when we knew there was a leak somewhere. The second guy who come the next day was great, took the time to help us find the leak and fixed it for us.",HomeServe
Competent cheerful plumber,HomeServe
"Would have been 5 star but engineer was late. The plus side was that he still came although past his finish time.Very pleasant man who did a very good job, unable to match tap cartridges so fitted a good quality new mixer tap. Checked over all underside plumbing before leaving. Can't praise him enough.",HomeServe
"i rang on a saturday morning and somebody was with me by lunchtime, he found the problem but needed some parts to repair, homeserve rang me the following week to make an appointment and a plummer came and rectified the problem. ",HomeServe
"Definitely five stars, a plumber called Pete called to let me know he was on his way with an estimated time of arrival. He was friendly and sorted the problem. Thank you",HomeServe

The blockage was cleared quickly and with no need to enter the house. ,HomeServe
Expert work by experienced and considerate plumber,HomeServe
I currently pay just 50p p/month (during year one) of my drainage cover and had a blocked external gulley/drain. I called up to book and was quickly through to a local UK call centre and talked with a guy who was easy to understand. I was booked in for an 8am-8pm appointment just a few days away and paid the Ã‚Â£30 excess. A more precise timescale would have been nice but the drainage guy called me in the morning of the appointment to let me know I'd be his first visit. Polite and helpful chap who sorted the blockage in no time. So it all went as it should and I have no complaints.,HomeServe
Plumber left panels behind toilet hanging off. ,HomeServe
"Booking the appointment with the automated system was quick and easy.The plumber was polite and listened carefully to our concerns. He worked quietly and steadily, and cleaned up afterwards.He answered all our questions leaving us happy with the service.",HomeServe
"I have had home serve a number of years and used them on a couple of occasions before. A series of events arose in quick succession recently , ranging from a leaking main water line to a toilet that would not stop running. From the initial call to the call centre to the completion of the job I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fault the service everyone was polite and efficient and all three engineers that came out to sort the problems were very good at what they did and the problems were all resolved. I would highly recommend Homeserve based on my experience and the peace of mind this insurance provides.",HomeServe

"Prompt, same day, response to emergency plumbing by friendly and efficient engineer, who also gave helpful advice about problem.",HomeServe
Plumber came same day and completely repaired our leaking pipe.  He was efficient and polite.,HomeServe
"To book the appointment was easy and quick. When the plumber arrived he said the tiles would have to be taken off the wall and maybe toilet moved too. As your job is only to fix the leak he left doing nothing. I have since found a plumber who did the job quickly without removing the tiles, he said it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hard and was in and out within 40minutes CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember the exact date ",HomeServe
Reported 26th plumber came 27th two ceased taps . We bought new taps only to be fitted. Plumber had to report what had to be done.  Plumber fitted taps on 10th April good job done. Just felt waited a while for it to be done. Had to go on site to see when he was due no confirmation  of due date. Considering  we bought the taps only to be fitted.,HomeServe
"Helpful and pleasant plumber, who found the source of the problem quickly.  Fortunately he has the replacement part in his van and the job was done quickly and efficiently.",HomeServe

Once through to human extremely good service.Plummer soon on site and did the necessary repair very professionally. He was also very pleasant ,HomeServe
"The call centre was very helpful in arranging a visit, but the agent that called was not helpful in fully diagnosing the potential fault in my drain. He was not willing to locate the correct man hole cover stating that 'he only had 20 minutes for the visit'. So I do not feel that my problem has been fully investigated despite paying the excess to have the visit.",HomeServe
"Yes, very pleased my toilet flush was fixed",HomeServe
Managed to get a plumbers visit in less then 48hrs. Even though my water leak from the sink was not an emergency. The plumber replace my sink waste trap and left leaving my bath clean and tidy.,HomeServe

My drains were blocked so I contacted HomeServe to get it sorted. I paid a Ã‚Â£30 excess and a really nice chap came out on bank holiday Monday bless him. It took him around 30 mins to sort and he gave me a useful bit of info around keeping drains clear. Thanks guys.,HomeServe
The plumber that attended my property was extremely polite and clean in his work.,HomeServe
"The engineers who attended were excellent. Identified the problem quickly and solved it successfully. The first engineer came 3 days earlier than due, as became available, so problem was identified earlier than expected. This was good as a different team had to be called in to solve the problem. Given 4 stars rather than 5 as we said we thought it was a drain problem when we first called Homeserve, but call handler said it was more likely to be mains. Turned out it was a drain issue but probably good idea to double check. ",HomeServe
The plumber did a very good job under very difficult conditions. He kept us informed at every stage of the work. I can't describe here the access problem but it must have been one of the worst he had come across. Thank goodness I had the insurance cover.,HomeServe
Immediate response to online request for plumber to attend to leaking toilet. Appointment made for next day. Email confirmation of appointment. Call from plumber an hour before his expected arrival. Arrived on time. Quickly identified problem - unstable pedestal as installer had not fitted floor bolt (not a standard fitting). With this information I was able to contact the company who had installed it in 2022 and get the problem fixed.,HomeServe
"The whole experience was easy and quick to organise,our Plumber was great he was helpful and nothing was too much for him and he was very efficient well done to all at homeserve",HomeServe
"On the second visit, the plumber telephoned to let us know he was on his way. Came when they said and fixed the leak. They tidied up & left the bathroom clean & tidy.The only issue was it took longer than hoped for the part to come and we had to chase it up with homeserve, who then chased up the plumbers.",HomeServe
"1)  The call-out visit was done on the same day as the phone call requesting a Plumber was made.2)   The plumber traced the problem within minutes of arriving, and it was all completed in 20 minutes.",HomeServe
This company use to be really good but they service has gone downhill I had a blocked drain so I had 2 guys come to fix it they took about 1 hour sorting it out but couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sort it then they made an excuse that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not covered not impressed at all waste of time donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t no what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m paying for ,HomeServe

"I call HomeServe for a blocked toilet. In the first instance, the appointment time is not great. I was given 8am -6pm. This is not good as it means I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t either go to work or plan properly for my day. Although, the plumber usually come in the morning but the slot time is the problem. Also, my blocked toilet is still in the same situation after 3 visits. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not happy.",HomeServe
The unblocking of the toilet was efficiently carried outbut the long wait was uncomfortable as we were housebound.,HomeServe
"Fast response & the person sent out to unblock the drains was professional & polite, fixed the problem & gave advice in stopping it happening again.",HomeServe
"The engineer was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable who quickly unblocked the drain and at a following camera survey identified the cause of the blockage and removed a brick stuck midway along the drain!Great customer service from him, pretty rare these days.",HomeServe
"When the engineer arrived he was very professional, located the leak (which was under my drive), fixed the leak and cleared up after the job finished. I would give the engineer 5 stars, however the downside was that from reporting the leak to the leak being repaired it was 20 days. The job was cancelled once and I had to phone to get the follow up appointment pulled forward as the leak had got worse. ",HomeServe
Drain cleared successfully despite being clogged with grouting material deposited unbeknownst to me by workmen recently at my house.  Quite a strenuous task but Homeserve plumber completed without complaint and removed all debris.,HomeServe
"David was so friendly, speaking about his day and experiences throughout his time here unblocking my drain. ",HomeServe
"Poor service. We had an issue with the washing machine. Water was coming out from behind so we called the plumber.The plumber spent less than 10 minutes and stated the pipes were fine and the fault was with the washing machine.We called an engineer out to look at the washing machine. The engineer that looked at the washing machine was great in comparison. He spent over an hour almost dismantling the machine and finally said the fault was not with the machine and to call the plumber.The engineer even identified what the problem was stating the fault was with the outlet  pipe. Based on these events and comparisons, I have provided 1 star.",HomeServe
Good service and helpful plumber ,HomeServe
"Plummer did the job required, pleasant young man.The only issue i had was trying to report my needs over the phone. Communication needs to be looked at.",HomeServe
"Firstly you  canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fully explain the fault as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an automated system and not a human you speak to .The engineer who attended  was very polite but was unsure he was allowed to fix the problem , leaking joints to a water softener . After advice he was very apologetic but was told not to carry out a repair even though I had paid the first Ã‚Â£30. The policy covers leaking joints and I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find anywhere that said it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t apply to water softener joints . ",HomeServe
The plumber was very good and helpfulSorted out the job and gave us some tipsHe was very knowledgeable and friendly ,HomeServe

"Made appointment online for engineer to come out and have a look at drainage. Engineer arrived on time, very friendly and helpful made a follow on appointment after intial consultation and works completed on that day.",HomeServe
Blocked toilet sorted or so I thought new pipe put but obviously not fitted correctly as every time toilet is flushed water has been leaking behind unit now have a stain  on sealing downstairs and waiting for it to be fixed today so another day wasted and a ceiling that needs painting also hope there is no damage to unit as it has obviously been leaking for a week  not happy ,HomeServe
"Kept us updated when he would arrive, replaced valve . So far no problems. excellent.",HomeServe
"Took longer than we would have liked for service engineer to visit, due to other problems in the area. When he did arrive he was friendly, helpful and efficient. Unfortunately he could not solve our problem as it was in the main drainage system, but he spoke to Anglian Water on our behalf to explain the problem, which resolved the issue a few days later.",HomeServe
"Glad I had this service, had emergency call due to a leak. Managed to get a plumber the next day.  They fixed my issue quickly. ",HomeServe

The plumber was very good and efficient. However I was very disappointed that my original appointment had to be cancelled as this set costs a lot of montane my appointment was made 5days in advance.  This has left me undecided on renewal for ,HomeServe
"Shocking is one word that comes to mind regarding home serve. Smashed my house to pieces to find a leak in the main bathroom shower. After being in the house 10 minutes they said I have a leak from shower. They then advised the best way was to take tiles out in an en suite not related to main bathroom because it backed on the the bathroom, they then advised they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get to it from that room and they will need to go through kitchen ceiling after explaining they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see anything from that because it was a faults ceiling. They then said that was the only way and cut a hole in the ceiling and told me they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get to it from that angle, and finally decided to look in the main bathroom shower!! Removed the tiles and found the leak!! Then they told me it was a two man job and he would need to return in the mean time I can turn water on and off with needed even though it had came through my kitchen ceiling and none of the electricity was working in that area after asking is it safe to do that I was told it will be fine just keep a bucket under to catch the water so it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t damage my flooring! On his return he came alone and said he might need another guy later. The other man turned up about an hour later they fixed the leak confirmed I could use my water as normal after cleaning the mess they had made I had half an hour in the bath then came to make a cupa to find my kitchen flooded again from a different area. I phoned them straight back I was advised to turn the water off againÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. And I was booked in the following day between 8-1 then at 1:15 I was told time had change to between 2-6 then 6;30 comes round still no sign, rang them said could be as late as 10Ã¢â‚¬Â¦. They guy came and said I must of had a second leak because it was my sink this time and because it was late on a Saturday night he advised it would be best to isolate the sink and wait till Monday, Mot a chance I was waiting! I said I wanted it done now he said if that was the case I might need to have a tap from the van and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s likely I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like them! I explained a didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care as long as it stopped leaking. He checked it and all it needed was a washer so he saidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the best company IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve dealt with! And IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be looking at another company next year. ",HomeServe
Plumber arrived on time with a prior notification. He was friendly and polite. He had the parts needed and the job was completed quickly and with the minimum amount of fuss.,HomeServe
Repair to water pipe completed within 4 days of phone call.,HomeServe
We have had to claim twice against our Homeserve Plumbing and Drainage Insurance. It took weeks to schedule plumber visits for leaking issues despite noting damage to our property. Multiple visits were made by different teams without adequate notes being shared. Teams often arrived ill prepared as they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know in advance what work they would need to undertake.,HomeServe
Operative was very pleasant and quickly identifed and fixed our leak. Dislike arrived 3 mins before end of 5 hour time slot and the damage caused getting to the problem was not repaired.,HomeServe
"We have recieved terrible service from Homeserve, do not join them as they are unproffesional, negligant engineers, take no accountability. An engineer came to unblock our sink and ended up with up flooding our living room by neglintanly leaving the pipe cap open. They are now refusing to take responsibilty and the worst part of it all is the lack of communication it has taken them 4 months to get back to us with a uninterested response ( we have been dealing with Emma). The flooring will cost us over 3k and we have been living in hazordous conditions as we cannot afford that. We are in pension age and we aren't even able to invite our grand kids around as it is not safe. It has caused us large amounts of stress and they do not care and not taking any responisbilty.",HomeServe
CUSTOMER CARE TEAM   Having the phone slammed down on me when I'm trying to explain that I have one toilet and it's not working She was telling me I'd have to wait days before before it was fixed after multiple times of explaining I have only one working toilet she told me she was putting the phone down on me and she did . Awful experience I had to ring 4-5 times during the same evening It's horrendous I have to jump through hoops to get my only toilet to be repaired One of your colleagues thought it was a good idea for me to just pour water down the toilet to flush My toilet was flooding my bathroom floor Customer care team (some not all) have no understanding or empathy when I explained to them my situation of not having a working toilet If you want to telephone me regarding this I'm happy to discuss this in great detail ,HomeServe

"The fitter was not a very tidy plumber. He fitted the mixer slightly off centre, also when taking the old mixer off he didnt take care to stop the tap leaking onto my floor. Under the sink he fitted 2 different types of turn off valves, the hot had a screw turn off but the cold has a blue handle which i had to get him to refit it properly as it was catching on the other pipe and pushing it back and forth each time you needed to turn the cold water off.",HomeServe
"We had an issue with a flushing toilet and as the tank of the toilet is siliconed to the wall, he attempted to fix it rather than replace it as this was easier, however we still have the same issue",HomeServe

The technician who attended was quite unfriendly and verging on being rude. Also the initial appointment was scheduled for a Friday am .

"If I am being honest I have had this insurance for many years and I was considering cancelling it until the worst happened and I had a pipe burst in my kitchen and water was coming through the celling. One phone call later to my relief a plumber was on his way and you know what I can not fault him at all, he was so professional, polite, and for someone who knows nothing about plumbing he spent the time to explain it all to me, i felt safe and taken care of all the way from the first phone call to the problem being fixed so to all who are thinking about going with homeserve please do it as you will not be disappointed",HomeServe
"The drainage engineer was fantastic, knew where the problem was straight away and fixed it in an hour. ",HomeServe
"The engineer arrived the same day after booking on-line. Two quarter-turn taps in a basin had practically stopped flowing because the ceramic valves were probably suffering from scale build up. It proved not possible to take the taps apart, again because of scale.  The engineer had to replace the taps, causing further problems. The job was done with skill and patience.",HomeServe

Very good service come the same day .Lee fixed the leak very clean and tidy.,HomeServe
I had to have 3 different plumbers to resolve what was a minor fault . My dissatisfaction is only with the first plumber who did not do the work . My fault was a minor bathroom leak that needed the water turning off . Plumber number 1 told me there was a fault with my stop cock so he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do the job . I showed him my external turn off point he told me that was working either . He left telling me I needed a different team to come and turn off my water supply and that they would contact me in 4 hours . This never happened turned out they were not given my mobile number and were using an out dated landline number . No appts available that day day . Plumber number 2 from external supply team arrived and turned the water off by the internal stop cock in approx 10 seconds and was clear there was no fault with it . Unfortunately he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the necessary equipment to do the internal repair so then had to wait for plumber number 3 . He arrived the same day fortunately and completed the work . I must be clear I have no complaint about plumber 2 and 3 but am appalled by my initial experience with a plumber who basically lied to me and clearly did not want to do the job . ,HomeServe
The plumber was amazing and very efficient - great service ,HomeServe

"The problem of a broken down pipe was fixed but the large replacement cover was left crooked and higher than the surrounding path, creating a potential hazard. My wife tripped over a lesser step and fractured her wrist resulting in a two hour operation, so I am wary of supposedly minor steps. Homeserve said they would look into it and let me know after five working days but two weeks later I still have no information. The original problem has been fixed but if I had been around when it was fixed I could have discussed the solution with the contractor. ",HomeServe

"I had 2 engineers come out to fix my Gerberit toilet as it was leaking over the bathroom floor.The first engineer came out and replaced a part in the cistern thinking that was the cause.But no, it was still leaking evenmore. So rang Homeserve back up and explained it wasn't fixed.  Then another engineer came out on a Sunday!! He literally took the back of the toilet apart and followed where the leak was coming from. He unbokted the toilet and found the culprit!! It was the seal inside the pipe that connects the toilet to the main cistern. He didn't give up until he had resolved the problem. I must say he was brilliant. So if ever I have a problem with thd toilet again please please send him.",HomeServe

"Still trying to get the excess fee refunded for a job that wasn't done!Waited 5 days and phoned again to be told the complaint has not been assigned to anyone! Doesthis mean there are so many being processed?Why isn't it straightforward?We paid Ã‚Â£30 excess fee, not call out fee. The man came, looked under the sink, supposedly phoned the office,said it wasn't covered and left.I had turned the isolater tap off to stop it leaking all over the floor. The engineer never touched it.He therefore didn't do the job, so there is no excess to pay. Please refund the money!",HomeServe
"I would have given 5 stars had I not waited 7 days for each appointment. First team couldn't do it due to leak being between mains and my house stopcock.  Daniel who carried out the repair was brilliant, did minimal damage to my kitchen floor, was very respectful and understanding of the stress the leak had caused.",HomeServe
"The plumber came in to investigate leak underneath the sink. My wife was present and I was at work. The plumber came in and run water for 3 minutes and then spoke to me on the phone and said he cannot find any issue, despite it's wet underneath the sink. He kept repeating that he has 30 minutes per job and he won't be wasting his time on this, as it's most likely a broken seal. Was very difficult to tell him anything. Didn't check the flexi pipe connection to the tap - I just told him to conduct a flood test and we confirmed it's a silicone seal, without ruling out a small leak from the flexi pipes - this I had done with a specialist plumber after the visit. The lady from complaints team said they cannot uphold my complaint against his interpersonal skills and the way he behaved on the job that spent 3-5 minutes doing, as he took photo of the sink, everything seemed fine, she wasn't there at the time and it's not mentioned in the plumber's report - obviously. Your plumbers represent your company and the way they behave and act, shows the real quality of the company and if you cannot investigate the way they behaved during the job, that's ridiculous.

"Update:I have emailed Leah. We have had introductory offer for plumbing and another for electrical. Unfortunately, we had to make a plumbing claim few months into the policy for a ceased tap but we were told that we had to wait until it was broken completely before we make a claim!! Meaning waiting until we have had mire problem as a result of snapped tap. Later on, when I complained about it, we were told that claim was never logged in and my complaint at the time was never recorded!!!Today we had a visit from the electrician for bathroom mirror claim. I have made it clear what it was. The call handler never asked questions. The engineer arrived , investigated then said itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not covered. I asked the engineer if he knew it was not  and why he investigated nevertheless! He said he had to because he was told to investigate. Simply to get paid for work!!When I rang the customer service, the agent got short and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like it and was borderline rude. They refused to refund the excess and said they will investigate the complaint first. So be warned as introductory offers are scams to rip you off and as a paid Service, I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recommend them. ",HomeServe

"Fabulous service from Jason at HomeServe. For the two days he has been on the job at our propery he bent backwards to get our water flow back running to normal flow and he did all the hard work which involved serious digging, lost of investgations and tests, and repairs and he managed to cause no disruptions to our property. He was hardworking, and very professional. We had low water flow 3ltr/minute throughout our home for some time before we decided to contact HomeServe. We were apprehensive about the job as we were told by various people that this could involve a lot of disruptions and damage to our house, possibly replacing the flooring etc. Jason managed to get the taps water running back on 15ltrs/minutes. He cleared everything before leaving. This has made such a positive difference to our lives and it feels like a weight has been lifted off our shoulders.

My elderly mother had a leak in the toilet which had flooded the carpet. I rang home serve and a plumber was out within a few hours. He had it fixed within half an hour. Fantastic service,HomeServe
Bad service over one week and still not fixed. - Four times they did not show up for the appointments. When they did they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do the work. The plumber argued that the work was drainage. The drainage man argued it was the plumbers work. They didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the part (durgo valve) even though they had been advised to bring it from day one. It is now day seven and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not fixed. Have made a formal complaint but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not resolved. We are suffering because there is a very bad drain smell in the house. We are very disappointed and distressed. Still waiting. ,HomeServe
"Thoroughly explained the problem on phone, but long story short, blocked and cracked waste pipe. 1st day I had to take off work and waited all day just for it to be cancelled, terrific. 2nd time you inexplicably sent a plumber who could obviously do nothing because drainage was quite clearly needed and today I have waited all day to be let down YET AGAIN. It's all a shambles to be honest. Don't have much hope that the problem will actually be rectified judging by the inability to actually look at the problem so far. Getting to the point I will use own people and bill you for the work. Would be quicker to learn to do myself via whatever college degree is needed than for you guys to do it.",HomeServe
"There is meant to be a DD guarantee so that customers are informed before ANY increase in monthly payment.  In December my electrics contract was increased by Ã‚Â£1.93 per month despite the fact I have to pay Ã‚Â£30 UPFRONT before any help will be sent.  NO LETTER WAS SENT....I WAS LIED TO BUT THAT IS NOT A SURPRISE.  NOW THEY ARE DOING THE SAME AGAIN ONLY THIS TIME IT IS THE DRAINAGE/PLYMBING which has been increased by Ã‚Â£10 per month. Again I was NOT given any notice of this as they just helped themselves to more of my money again.   I have made several phone calls and told that there was a letter in the post....NOTHING HAS EVER ARRIVED.  I feel for the employees of HomeServe as they are always on the front line while the greedy bosses hide.  So TWO INCREASES AND NO NOTIFICATION....do the FCA allow them to do this...seems they must because I know it happens all the time now to me.  Although yesterday, Saturday 4 May I received a letter from HomeServe dated 22 April 2024 informing me that they were sorry to hear I was unhappy  and they were hoping to put things right. I did suggest that the increase of Ã‚Â£10 was no doubt to THANK ME FOR THE HORRENDOUS BILL I FACE REPLACING THE SOLID OAK FLOORING RUINED BY THE SLOW LEAK CAUSED BY THE COWBOY PLUMBER WHO UNBLOCKED A SINK BY DRILLING DOWN THROUGH THE PLUGHOLE AND DAMAGING THE TAP WHICH LEAKED FOR MONTHS AND OF COURSE WAS NOT NOTICED BECAUSE THE PIPES ARE ALL BOXED IN AND THE FLOOR IN THIS LAVATORY IS MARBLE BUT THE WATER WENT UNDER THE FLOOR TO THE HALLWAY....SO THANKS HOME SERVE FOR YOUR NOT SO WONDERFUL PROFESSIONAL SERVICE TO ME.  You were aware of my husband's horrendous death and treated me with disdain....but then we Army families are used to this disgusting treatment at the hands of corporations who feed on greed.  What other conclusion can I come to after what I am still facing trying to get my home back to being ""normal"".  You at Home Serve well know you SUB CONTRACT to others to do work at a cheaper rate and hope to get away with it....and it seems you do.  Sadly the Ombudsman is a paper tiger.... and I will again be ignored by HomeServe as STILL NO LETTERS OF ADVICE IN RESPECT OF INCREASED DDs",HomeServe
"Signed up for Homeserve after their details were in my annual water bill.  Households in my area are having a lot of problems with gardens overflowing with water,  It seems from local news that our water pipes are full of solidify waste from the local Takeaway food shops that are putting their cooking oil down the drains instead of getting it collected as they should, they are avoiding the charges with this and it so easy to pour it down the drain, the council is not interested and it is householders that are having to pay out when they get a blocked drain.

"Homeserve engineer Robert Stranaghan came out to access a leak that Anglia Water stated I have . Robert was very thorough and did various test to confirm where in my driveway the leak was . This leak had been going on and off for the past two years and after having numerous people out from Anglia Water and Homeserve , Robert was the only one that managed to locate the leak.I was booked in a week later for the works to be carried out and was glad that Robert was the engineer assigned to my job . I found Robert to be very respectful of my property, polite and professional in his work . The leak was located 3ft under my driveway exactly where Robert had previously marked the block paving where he believed it to be. All the mud and hardcore under the block paving when digging down was put into buckets, Robert was a very clean worker and there was no mess on my driveway during the dig or after it was all put back .I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rate this engineer any high other than saying he is the best at what he does.Homeserve you have a excellent engineer here , Robert is a credit to your company ",HomeServe

"To begin, there's a Ã‚Â£30 upfront payment required for any claim, referred to as 'excess', irrespective of the eventual repair cost assessment. When the plumber arrived to fix a leak, they determined the toilet was cracked and needed replacement. However, as we have a second toilet in the house, they deemed it beyond their responsibility. Consequently, they merely drained the water, leaving us with an unusable toilet. Adding to the frustration, the plumber seemed rushed, likely due to a long list of appointments. Overall, it was a disappointing service experience and not worth the insurance money.",HomeServe

"Shocking. Easy to get through to book an appointment but when they come to fix one simple things caused more issues. Came to fix a toilet that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flushing correctly.

Had to book a other appointment where a different engineer turned up knowing nothing about the parts the first engineer ordered and had to book me in for another date. 3rd engineer turned up, still had no handover and no parts...

"Normally a very good service. But unfortunately I had called them out, as I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t open my radiator tap, even with a wrench!  So the radiator was constantly hot! Sadly Bank holiday was the closest appt. When the plumber arrived, although courteous he did seem to be in a rush. He quickly undid the tap with a twist. Explaining it was tight but he could undo it and that I probably needed a new Radiator valve. Normally they would have either fitted a new one there and then or at least sourced it and return to fit it. But he shot off. I even ( as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a pensioner I forget things) had to stop him at his car to get the name of the fitting he said I needed. Since then I STILL find it hard to undo or now tighten the valve?

After a phone call to his office he returned to say the gully had collapsed some while back and that i would have to get it fixed as it was not covered under the policy. That was fine but if they had told me that when I initially contacted them I would be Ã‚Â£30 better off and I would have not had to cancel pre arranged appointments for that day. ",HomeServe
Great service.  The plumber was very helpful and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently.  ,HomeServe
"Easy to say the leak cannot fix then leave but excess was paid.In front of me, the plumber said I could get back the excess. After I asked the cs of home serve when I could get back excess, they said the plumber didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mention it, said the leak not included.",HomeServe
"Our next door neighbour informed us that a sewage smelling liquid was leaking into his garden from ours. It was non urgent but I contacted Homeserve on the Sunday afternoon and they arranged a visit on the Tuesday after the Bank Holiday.  The friendly engineer came on time, explained what he was doing and cleared the blockage in the drain. We were not sure where the leak actually was but it appears it may not be on my property.  If it occurs again he suggested I contact the water company.  He cleaned up and replaced everything in the garden as it was.  He was excellent.  thank him.",HomeServe
The drain clearance took less than 30 minutes including the setting up and blockage was unblocked within minutes. The Engineer new exactly where the blockage was and gave me additional information on any future drain blocks.,HomeServe
"I was very pleased with how HomeServe dealt with my recent water leak problem. From start to finish, the problem was dealt with very professionally and quickly. I would have no hesitation in recommending HomeServe to others.",HomeServe
"The drainage /water issue I reported to Homeserve was dealt with very quickly and efficiently from start to finish . I was especially impressed by being contacted on Bank Holiday Sunday to rearrange an unavoidably  postponed appointment . All staff were friendly and polite at all times , and the problem was fixed within 10 days of being reported . Excellent service. Thank you all . Jean Smart.",HomeServe

"my kitchen tap suddenly started to drip, quite fast, and I knew I couldn't ignore it.  I booked an appointment, which I was pleased to discover was as soon as next day if I liked.  I took that slot, and a friendly, capable technician arrived on time, took one look and said would I like a new mixer tap altogether? I said yes, and I am very pleased with the the new item, with lever taps and and a large rise on the outlet.  It was a complicated job, and took the best part of two hours, but it was all covered by the contract.  Very satisfied, who wouldn't be, and I would always recommend HomeServe (my one other use of them was a drain clearance in the front garden, and again that was 100% on time and satisfactory)",HomeServe
"Alan the engineer was so very kind, efficient and helpful.  He located the leak in the concrete floor, which took considerable skill and patience, and mended it.  I was so relieved and grateful.",HomeServe
Plumber was very professional smart and pleasant and work was promptly completed.,HomeServe
"The engineer was experienced, knowledgable and was able to pinpoint the issue right away - a leaky hot tap had a rubber stopper inside it which had just got old and gone hard, so started dripping. They replaced the spindle thing and stopper it's attached to and it's like a new tap again. I'm annoyed I put off getting it sorted for so long, fixed in minutes!",HomeServe
"The Homeserve engineer, a Romanian  called  Claudiu ,was very helpful and efficient and quickly repaired the leak in the pipe in the attic ",HomeServe
"I had a leak from a repair which Homeserve had completed. My initial experience of them attending my property to repair this leak I gave them two stars. However, Homeserve were very keen to put things right for me. The Customer Relations Team called me and they arranged an early morning visit which was very much appreciated and now the leak is all fixed. Thank you to the Customer Relations Team and the plumber who did my repair today. I am very grateful.",HomeServe
Stopcock was seized. The plumber inserted a new stopcock rather than try to free up the old one. Very speedy and efficient repair. I was very impressed by the speed and cleanliness. No mess at all!,HomeServe

Easy to book an appointment online. Engineer arrived during the allotted time and replaced a leaking radiator valve. He was courteous and friendly. Happy to recommend.,HomeServe
"Our experience with HomeServe over the last week has been absolutely shocking! We originally arranged for an engineer to return to repair a small leek in an upstairs toilet on Wednesday. They subsequently failed to show up for 6+ booked appointments for four days in a row. This includes failing to turn up for morning appointments which then were confirmed/ rebooked afternoon and then late evening appointments. The first appointment was cancelled by their plumber who claimed not to be confident with the repair, saying he would rather the original plumber should attend!!!??The saga continues. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still waiting and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Saturday morning now as the leek is still there and getting worse!",HomeServe
"Jack, the Homeserve engineer came to look at the water coming from under our house. He ran many tests, not a leak under our property. So we need to go to water company. BUT Jack had a comprehensive look at water and has booked us for a plumber visit for a leaking tap and alerted us to a problem with a sewage outlet which the sewage water company are coming to fix. A very positive experience from an engineer who knew his stuff and was very helpful. Hope if I get any more problems he is the engineer who comes out. Thank you Jack",HomeServe
Having made their assessment Phil came the very next morning to fix the leak in our house.  Extremely pleasant and affable he explained exactly what he would need to do to fix the problem having located it with his sounding rod.  It was slightly more challenging in that he had to remove the inlaid pebbles that formed the floor of the hallway above the leak.  He enjoyed the challenge!  The leak was repaired having to put in a bridging pipe and all was put back better than previously within 3 1/2 hours.  We couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recommend Homeserve more highly and Phil is a superb ambassador for the company.  Thank you. Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸ÂÂ¶Ã°Å¸ÂÂ¶,HomeServe
I have been waiting for and emergency call out since yesterday morning. I was told that a plumber would be with me between 12:00 and 18:00. No one arrived and no one called. When I called them I was told that the previous job had over run and someone would be with me by 22:00. None arrived and no one called. I was then told by customer services that someone would call me between 07:00 and 10:00 this morning. Still waiting. Service plan costs over Ã‚Â£500 a year. What am I paying for? Disgusting lack of service and courtesy in an emergency situation. Plus you can't make your own complaint. You have to try to get past the AI call handler and then the call centre says they will take your complaint.....really!! ?? ,HomeServe
"The representative who came to clear our drains was friendly, hard working and efficient.Our only grumble was that we completed the request form for the 'emergency' visit on Sunday,and the earliest somebody could come to do the work, was Wednesday.",HomeServe
The plumber who attended our home was very polite and friendly. He was able to identify and rectify the problem quickly and gave good advice. ,HomeServe
"Called Homeserve out for a blocked drain and found the whole booking service great to navigate and book. Engineer called and did the drain, seemingly all ok ? However after 2 days same problem? Got in touch via chat and Sean sorted an appointment with an engineer straight away, no fuss. Engineer came, sorted and all good.Excellent service.",HomeServe
"The engineer, specially the young kid who visited my property had a good knowledge of plumbing and trouble shooting problems. Overall both the engineers were very calm  very helpful and very cooperative. ",HomeServe
The blockage in the sink has come back within a week,HomeServe
Your engineer from Cannock came to fix our blocked drain. He was excellent and knew exactly what to do. Thank You.,HomeServe
"I made a claim the day before (Sunday) bank holiday. I was delighted to hear the plumber would be with me the next day on the bank holiday. The plumber who's name was Conner did a great job of clearing a blocked drain. He was polite, pleasant and obviously knew his job. He was efficient, effective and completed the work very much to my satisfaction. ",HomeServe
"I have reported a leak outside my house from not known from how and got appointment on Wednesday 8 May 2024, 08:00 - 13:00 for the visiting time for the engineer. that was exactly 10 days since reported about the claim. The engineer turn up before 12 pm. The engineer looked at the leak and said that plumber has to see it not him. So called his head office and said someone will come tomorrow Thursday 9 May between 08:00 - 13:00. I got the same appointment message on my mobile and waited for tomorrow. Unfortunately no one turn up at the given time. I had to call Home Serve to find out the problem, instead got information the appointment was booked for 13:00 - 18:00 on that day and someone turn up after 16:30 on that day. Soon as he looked at the situation, he said he can not do it and it has to be done by Drainage Team. Neither the first person on 8th May, checked the situation thoroughly nor the second person on the 9th May. Instead the second person (Engineer) booked through his mobile to the head office for the Monday 13th May 08:00 - 13:00 (that was the conversation with his colleague on the phone) and was telling him Greg will come on Monday 13th May same time 08:00 - 13:00 . I thought I will get a confirmation and but he said it's booked for Monday. Monday 13th, I have waited till 14:00 but not seen any sight of the Engineer so I called the Home Serve regarding the situation. Instead I learn it is booked for 15th May but there wasn't any correspondences regarding the booking date. I only got an excuse of saying Sorry it was a mistake by Home Serve. It didn't solve my problem, which I have request for to carry out the work I was asking for. I have to off for 3 (three) days which was unpaid for 2 days. The first appointment was I booked holiday but next 2 appointment was not possible as it was short notice to get holidays. Neither Home Serve operator (Hannah) did good job nor the manager  (Adam). It's easy to take the money from the customer and when certain situation comes to deal with it Home Serve had failed to comply with your commitment.Everyday, I enter my house, I can smell that damaged or rotten wooden smell and I am still very angry with the service providing by Home Serve. Now what kind of damage is done by the issue I reported Home Serve, I have no Idea.  ",HomeServe
Very efficient friendly service. Gave good advice and their subcontractors [SOS] found source of leak quickly and in a professional manner. Thanks Mike from SOS and Scott from Home Serve. ,HomeServe
"Great service , had quite a concerning issue with our plumbing , came with 24 hours and matter was sorted within half hour and put our minds at rest. Lovely lady at reporting stage asked questions in order to have an idea of the problem..she was spot on...guy came and sorted with the minimum of fuss. It was really first class i wouldnt hesitate to recommend Homeserve . Thank You  ",HomeServe
The person who came was very good and cleared the blockage.,HomeServe
I contacted Homeserve  regarding a blocked kitchen sink.  They came out twice and the second time the the engineer said it needed the drainage people in. He organised this and the work they carried out was satisfactory.,HomeServe
The plumber was very professional and did a excellent job.,HomeServe
We discovered a leaking stopcock late on Friday evening. Plumber from Homeserve arrived Saturday morning and fixed the problem in 15 minutes. A brilliant job!,HomeServe
"Your engineer knew immediately what the problem was, put it right and waited for to make sure all my plumbing was working properly.  He was polite and tidy.  Well done!",HomeServe
"Both engineers who came were very courteous and helpful. I couldn't fault them. I do find that a Ã‚Â£30 excess for each call excessive. The first call, the problem righted itself. The second all the engineer had to do was put some binding tape round and extremely 'old' stopcock, which really should have been replaced. ",HomeServe
Homeserve Engineer was quick and efficientTo fix my leaking tap. Turned u on time,HomeServe
Competent engineers who spent time diagnosing why my water usage to 27 March was 3 times the norm.Could not identify a leak and said the meter was stationary when no water was being used. So advised that ST should instal new meter. This process is under way so do not know why usage was so high.Meter currently seems to be working normally.,HomeServe
I was dealt with very well on my telephone conversation requesting assistance on a plumbing problem.  The employee who called at the house was first class especially his knowledge and excellent attitude.,HomeServe
"I had just completed a total landscape of my backyard into a courtyard garden.  Four weeks later, I had a deluge of water and waste leaking from my upstairs bathroom soil pipe.  I was in a panic and frantic about the potential cost of work.  I rang Homeserve immediately and reported the event.  I realised I was speaking to a BOT but it was clear and efficient and in two minutes it was confirmed that I was covered by my insurance.  The first engineer came on 7th but realised it was too big a job for him alone.  He was personable and helpful and said he would contact the Drainage Team.  That engineer came on the 8the, fully equipped with suction tubes, pipes etc.  The two manhole covers had been sealed by the landscapers but he found a solution by cutting a hole in the offending pipe which allowed him to release the blockage.  This provides a solution if future leaks happen.  Again, a friendly, courteous engineer and this challenging job was completed in just over an hour.  Thank you so much.  I am a female senior citizen with no knowledge of plumbing, so I was doubly grateful.",HomeServe

"Quick and easy to contact. No quibble over dealing with the issue. We needed a plumber and they came the same day we made the call to Home serve. All staff were professional, friendly and knowledgeable. Problem resolved on first visit. If course, it will depend on how much Homeserve increase next year's premium, based on one pretty straightforward and simple  plumbing issue as to whether I feel it fair and whether I can recommend. At the moment, I will have to reserve final judgment.",HomeServe
"The problem in my Bathroom was caused by flat above and resolved and Homeserve could not assist further. However, the engineer gave me so very good advice and my problem is now resolved.",HomeServe

"Dave and Bob got to grips with a seemingly intractable drainage problem repeatedly affecting our kitchen sink. By a combination of expertise, experience,persistence and sheer determination they managed to discover the cause of the problem ( an historic fault dating from when the house was built) and rectify it. It took them 4 hours. We are impressed and very grateful . ",HomeServe
"The engineer, Kyle, was professional, friendly and fitted new taps in the kitchen so quietly and quickly that we never knew what he was doing until the end. The taps work perfectly. The call-out time was also quick. ",HomeServe
"  When a pipe burst and flooded the kitchen on a Sunday afternoon we thought we wouldn't get help before Monday. And so it proved with the services we phoned, that is, until we phoned Homeserve. The person we spoke too was as helpful as could be and said a plumber would call within the next five hours. They phoned within an hour and arrived shortly afterwards. Again they were very helpful and supportive, explaining what was wrong and what they were doing. They had it fixed within the hour and when they had left we felt like celebrating.So thank you Homeserve for making all this possible and to the member of staff and the plumber for getting it done.

"it was a simple job to fix a leak from a CCTV access point in a foul soilpipe, so long as the required specialist part was to hand.  The first chap didn't have the particular part so he kindly rang a colleague who did, and who travelled to me as soon as he was finished elsewhere.  The fitting takes almost no time, but without the part, the job becomes difficult, involving cutting out the relevant section of downpipe and fitting a new section (without a CCTV access point). That was avoided, and everyone was very friendly and helpful.  All good.",HomeServe
"We had a block in one of our drain pipes. The guys who came out were brilliant, special thanks to Alan. Who would not give up sorting out the problem. Very much appreciated with the service we received",HomeServe

The engineer gave up rather quickly and passed the buck to the water board. He did speak to the call centre for me on the phone to explain what he thought was the problem! Water board came out 10pm ish and there was a broken pipe in the back lane (drain water still flowing freely) but also a blockage on our side. The engineer from there cleared the blockage for me within 5 minutes and tested with dye to check all was ok with the camera down. Far better service than the HomeServe engineer who just seemed quick to pass the buck! ,HomeServe
I paid the excess and because the plumber couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t replicate the issue he left which is a bit annoying having paid an excess for nothing ,HomeServe

Very disappointed, lost my excess payment, wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t renew.Thankyou for your reply and I appreciate your refund of the Ã‚Â£30. excess. I do think though that you should mention specifically the fact that you do not cover shower tray leaks as I did not know at the time the leak was coming from there and had already paid the excess for nothing. You have redeemed yourself and so I will now certainly consider renewing when renewal is due.",HomeServe
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a lovely shiny new tap from your engineer who was very quick and pleasant to talk to. ,HomeServe

I have rejoined homeserve after finding there plumbers offer a first class service,HomeServe
"The first time I have ever been compelled to write a review!For the 4th time, running very underwhelmed by the service. The first available appointment was 8 days away, then cancelled on the day of the appointment due to illness, came 2 days later and could not fix the issue as""it's a special tap,"" just as the time before was the ""special thermostat"" and the time before that when the gas engineer grumbled that ""it was hard to get front off the boiler,"" or the time before that when the plumber knocked my wall down with his van and denied doing it! It must be bad if I am going back to British Gas!!!",HomeServe
"I had to have 2 visits. Both men were lovely. They were patient, friendly, helpful. Homeserve came very quickly after my phone calls.I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fault the engineers and the drain is fixed.Thank you to the engineers and the helpful customer support ",HomeServe
Excellent service.  Water leak repaired swiftly.  Having Homesure cover is money well spent.  Highly recommended.,HomeServe
"I had a leak coming through the ceiling at the top of my stairs.  I phoned about it and was told that there would be someone out before 1pm.  The plumber then phoned me to say that he was in Lanark and would be at my home by 1pm.  He did arrive just before one and had the problem fixed in less than 20 minutes.  He found that a rubber washer had perished where water entered the storage tank.  He replaced this, the water stopped dripping and it took a day or two for the ceiling to dry out.He was a very pleasant efficient young man. ",HomeServe
"I waited in all day for plumber who was due in the morning. At 4.30 in the afternoon I called them,  "" oh didn't anyone call to reschedule"". No said I. It was rebooked for next day in the evening. ",HomeServe
It has been agreed that the plumber will do two jobs but when he arrived late in the afternoon he was only aware of one job! He couldn't do it (cylinder in the airing cupboard) as we have to drain the heating system down to repair the pipe as it'll take a long time. He said someone will contact me to rebook but we heard nothing since!,HomeServe
"The plumber who called was very experienced, polite, and very efficient. I was very impressed",HomeServe
Problem dealt with quickly and efficiently (blocked drain),HomeServe
"Engineer was a genius!. I have had several problems over the years with the discharge from the kitchen sink.On 11th May, having flushed the bathroom toilet, the patio flooded with what looked like sand! I rang the Home Serve hotline and got an automated (Hannah) response that gave me a date for the following Tuesday.At the end of the call, I was given the option of talking to a human being. I explained that my wife and I were vulnerable adults and the bathroom and kitchen  were now unusable. I was given an appointment for the same day. The engineer turned up and immediately diagnosed a 'Fat Berg' 'upstream' in a  manhole cover that had never been lifted. Fat Berg removed!",HomeServe
The second visit was so much better than the original call out.The plumber who came the first time was in my home for no longer than ten minutes & said I need a leak team out.If he had looked at my back boiler which he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even attempt to do he would have seen water straight away. He was trying to even say that my carpet wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wet when it clearly was.I had to wait a few days for the next plumber to come who was very thorough & certainly knew his job.This high rating is therefore for him.He is a credit for you to have employed him.,HomeServe
Arrived same day and quickly located and fixed the leak.,HomeServe
"Following initial contact with Homeserve regarding a suspected leak, an appointment was made for a visit. we found the service professional, timely and efficient from start to finish,Would highly recommend Thanks Homeserve",HomeServe
"On discovering a leaking toilet pipe, I contacted HomeServe. I've held a contract for a number of years. This is the first time I've needed their help but thank God for the service! The guy responded the next day, I think,  and fitted a new pipe. No more leaks. He was done in about 15 minutes. Amazing service. Thank you very much  ",HomeServe
"Both plumbers were very helpful, friendly and courtious.The dates were about 2 weeks and 4/5 weeks ago",HomeServe
Arranging for someone to attend our house and unblock the drain was really simple. However Tom who attended the job was an absolute star. He could have done the minimum to clear the block but he wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave until he had cleared all the Ã¢â‚¬ËœrubbleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ meaning we wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a repeat issue for the foreseeable. He is a great ambassador for Homeserve.,HomeServe
"We had an emergency water leak , the booking of the visit was easier , however the plumber or engineer did not perform the proper check and missed the leak / broken seal underneath the bath tub . ",HomeServe
Very nice person who was helpful in explaining but the only thing that was be done was turning the water flow down a touch. But it didn't didn't stop the problem. Ã‚Â£30 to turn a tap down is expensive.,HomeServe

They turned up at the appointed time, unblocked the drain in about 10 seconds flat and off they went. Super.

Your engineers tend to waste a  of of time sitting in their vans before and after the visit. Wete not co ordinated by your office. We needed 2 people and the right equipment. Neither happened. Eventually after the 4th visit 2 came but over 45 minutes apart. Still did not have the right equipment and told me that I had to get  an unblocker from the supermarket!!! The issue is still there with a partly blocked drainage pipe .I am a wheelchair user and did not appreciate having such a solution. Basically we can't help you. What a poor service and value for money.,HomeServe
"The young man was very polite, efficient and answered all my queries as I have not had this issue ever in my life!! A blocked drain! Thank you. ",HomeServe
The Plumber who attended late in the evening ( 8pm)  was professional / polite / and  committed to competing the job  despite the lateness of the hour: he was a credit to Homeserve,HomeServe
"The detection & repair of my mains supply was carried out with exemplary skill, promptness & courtesy. Easily 5 stars. Sadly confusion occurred & the allocation of the problem to the plumber attending on Saturday 04 /05 was a mistake.  He was very helpful & arranged an appt for Monday 06/05. This left the leak for a further 2 days. Please give some attention  to the training needs of your phone advisers. This was clearly an external leak. Thank you for your attention. ",HomeServe
Took three times to fix leak kept moving along the joints ,HomeServe
Had a leak on my mains water supply.  Only had to wait 2 days for my appointment.   Engineers found the source of the leak. Lifted flags and dug where was needed to complete repair.  Very pleased.  ,HomeServe
"Turned up on time, courteous, Cleared the drain in a matter of minutes, no mess",HomeServe
Had a problem with the flush in toilet it took 3 visits to sort the problem and two of those were cancelled on the day and had to rearrange. ,HomeServe
"After an initial failure to turn up, The plumber arrived at 07.50 on Sunday morning. He soon found the fault and it was quickly repaired. ",HomeServe
"The engineer was prompt, rang before coming, very helpful, explained everything, washed through the drains and very polite.",HomeServe
"The plumber came out promptly and had never came across Durapipe so he contacted his colleagues.  As it happened another plumber had the right size parts and came out as well.  Two plumbers, good service from both.",HomeServe
"A speedy response to my claim for a leaky stop valve and a sound, clean job done with the minimum of disruption.",HomeServe
"Well pleased with response time. Fellow came out next day to assess the leak, Plummer came out next day and repaired it. Job well done. ",HomeServe
The engineer was polite and professional and cleared the blockage. Thank you.,HomeServe
"This was an emergency burst pipe at the stopcock inside 4pm. No access to outside stopcock. No engineer in our area they said so they said we will escalate this and ask an external contractor to come out within 4 hours, horror as water everywhere. 4 hours later nothing. Next morning text saying someone will be with you between 6-10pm! Pushed many times in panic as downs stairs bathroom and hall flooding! Came out at 4pm ie 24 hours after I reported it as an emergency. Guy who came was amazing! ",HomeServe
"I appreciated the quick response from HomeServe UK to attend a leaking radiator. Sadly for me, the radiator had corroded from the inside rather than water leaking from a loose connection. Although my policy did not cover this leak, the engineer was reassuring and helped me to know what I needed to do.Thank you.Carole",HomeServe
The plumber phoned beforehand to say he was on his way and arrived well within the timescale given.  He was very professional and efficient in clearing my blocked washbasin.,HomeServe
"The engineer was very friendly, extremely efficient in sorting out the problem and even hosed down the drive after fixing the drain problem. Excellent service.",HomeServe
Engineer arrived on time. Explained the problem with the push plug and replaced.  Cancelled job on tap and refunded as it needed a valve. Will return to replace when new valve received.,HomeServe
"They attended my property for a slow running sink, done the usual checks then said they needed to get the guy with the drain snake, which they did, however he just smashed up the floor in my conservatory and told me it wasn't their problem,  then left",HomeServe
"I mean wow this company have driven us round the bend.27/2 - We initially had an external leak which the engineer came out and swiftly fixed by replacing that section of Galv pipe with plastic. He informed us the Galv pipe was corroded and showed us the rust building up inside. This had caused our drinking water to have flakes of rust in and we had stopped drinking from our tap recently due to the site of this. He informed us the best route forward would be to replace the whole length of Galv pipe (a 15M straight run) but we would have to do this ourselves. Not an issue, we organised an external engineer with a Mole van to come out and replace the pipe. So far so good..I rang Homeserve to request they put the engineers return visit back so our Moling engineer could attend, I was then assured that Homeserve could complete that work as it was within my allocated claim capacity and that the initial engineer would return with a Homeserve supplied Mole engineer which would all be covered within our policy, ""result"" we thought.. 12/3 The initial engineer showed up on his own with no notes of the conversation I'd had with the customer relations team. I showed him the call log and he was obviously unable to complete the work without the required equipment. He spoke to his manager and they informed me I would have to raise an official complaint in order to get the work carried out. I raised one and awaited a call back..Two months passed and we received two letters informing us that they were aware of our complaint and would get back to us in due course. This was despite the fact that we have rust filled drinking water, a hole in my patio so my young children cannot play outside, and they have unfortunately damaged my waste water pipe meaning my waste water has been flowing into my house foundations the entire time. 16/5 Another engineer finally showed up and I was told he would be there to give a second opinion and if he agreed with the complaint then Homeserve would look to replace the corroded mains water feed. When I spoke to him he had no knowledge of this and informed me his manager had explicitly told him to complete the repairs and close the job.. He could not find another external leak but believed there may be an internal leak so very helpfully booked in an internal plumber and a drainage engineer to attend on 23/5.23/5 - The two engineers arrived bright and early, great start! As soon as I opened my side gate to show them the hole in my patio and explained the damage plus what Homeserve had promised over the phone they nervously laughed and informed me they had not been made aware of the extent of the issue. So they have booked in 2x further engineers to attend on 3/6..I have since spoke with Homeserve complaints team and they have listened to all the numerous calls back and forth over the last few months as they are all recorded. The company are attempting to go back on their promise of replacing the Mains water feed and have said that the advisor who spoke to me ""should not have offered for that work to be complete"".In summary; for a quick repair like a leaking tap etc. this company are fine to deal with but management behind the scenes are a shambles and will lie to customers. I have taken 4 days off work so far (soon to be 5) to accomodate their engineers who to be fair have been fairly faultless bar the accidental damage to the waste water pipe. Do not get your cover through this company.04/06 - I immediately replied to the ""heretohelp"" team that responded to this complaint and have heard nothing back since! Be warned with this company they are a nightmare to deal with.",HomeServe
"The Home Serve engineer was very pleasant and courteous. As well as fixing my cistern, he explained why the plumbing problem occurred and how it could be avoided in future.

Although the first appointment was cancelled at around 5pm, having waited in all afternoon !Fast response and confirmation of appointment.Excellent repair/replacement, carried out quickly, cleanly and professionally.Friendly and knowledgeable plumber.",HomeServe
"Called homeserve to attend to a water leak in my home.  They sent a message that a plumber would call between 1pm and 6pm so I took the afternoon off so that someone would be at home.  Called them at just after 5:30pm to be told the plumber could not make it today but someone would be out tomorrow between 8am and 1pm. No message by 6:30 pm so I called to find out whats happening. Been on hold now for 20 minutes.  Had the same experience the last time I called them out, I was hoping the level of service would have improved.  It would appear not.",HomeServe
The 2 gentlemen who finally came to fix the problem were brilliant and did a very good job. It was quite frustrating that it took 3 separate visits from different engineers before finally the on the 4th visit it was fixed. We then had 2 further visits to finish the job with one chap coming to fit the stop tap turning up without the part.,HomeServe
The plumber was very helpful and very polite and fixed my leak in 10 minutes,HomeServe
Very happy that Homeserve made several visits to get a problematic tap fixed. Great work thanks ,HomeServe
"The problem became apparent when we came home from holiday in the early hours of Sunday 12th May 2024, when we could not run any cold water from our upstairs taps. On Monday 13th at 9:15 I phoned Homeserve, spoke to a VERY helpful operator, Chloe, who contacted your technician, Jack, told me she could provide an appointment between Ã¢â‚¬Å“now and 6pmÃ¢â‚¬Â and Jack would call when he was ready to leave his previous appointment. In fact, following his call, he arrived at 10:30 am, fixed the problem very quickly and efficiently and left us before 12:30 pm! The problem has not recurred. We were amazed at the speed with which, on a Monday morning, both your operator Chloe and your engineer Jack solved our problem. Excellent work! CY.",HomeServe

I called at 5pm Tuesday and assured that the plumber would arrive shortly the plumber called just gone 6 asked some questions and decided it was too big a job to do that day so he would ask it to be booked first thing Wednesday. The appointment was rebooked for Thursday and the plumber eventually arrived about 11. He did a great job and fixed the leak, but the delay meant the damage caused by the leak was much greater than if it had been fixed when originally promised",HomeServe
The engineer was very polite  he was on time and fixed the problem with my taps and installed a lovely new mixer tap. Excellent service.,HomeServe
"We had an outside leak in oyur mains supply yo the house that was hard to locate. The engineer who came was quick, hardworking and did a great job fixing the problem.

Very impressed by the service . The young man who came was pleasant polite and very efficient. Came on the day that was organised to fix my dripping tap and the work was very well done . Thank you so much .,HomeServe
With boilers they will basically  only cover new or nearly new boilers.With plumbing don't expect them to do anything other than basic tasks.They were quite efficient  a few years back but now seem to have really sub standard staff.Plumber came without basic tools did nothing then left with no solution to a basic blocked waste pipe.I had to get a mate out who fixed it in 5 minutes so I had to obviously pay him.I complained to Himeserve who seem unable to accept that they have provided sub standard serve.It's taken weeks and weeks.They havnt reimbursed what we had to pay out.Customer Service was poor.We won't be renewing our contract.,HomeServe

However the mains cold water was extremely loud when turned on in kitchen, was a bit concerned as we were going away for 2 weeks the following day so I turned water off at stopcock to be safe. He actually hadn't opened isolation valve to cold water feed fully so that was causing the noise, managed to fix it myself this morning.",HomeServe
I was very happy with the service I received. He was very professional and fully explained the issue with the toilet. He finished the work successfully. ,HomeServe

"I have been with Homeserve for many years.I found the Drainage Engineer quite abrupt.He wasn't able to solve the blockage as it was United Utilities responsibility.He was arragant,dismissive and had an unpleasant attitude.My neighbour came out as it is a shared driveway and she walked away within minutes as she too found him quite obnoxious.Very disappointing.",HomeServe
"Just had water leak fixed on driveway by homeserve which Thames water would not fix due to being on my property , homeserve fixed the problem with no hassle.

Due to his previous calls the plumber arrived outside the time window given but I was given a call late morning to let me know he was running late.  On arrival he quickly fixed the problem (dripping tap).  He was expecting a leaking pipe even though I had clearly said Ã¢â‚¬Å“dripping tapÃ¢â‚¬Â when making the appointment with the chatbot.  That was the only poor aspect of the experience - not having an actual person handle the initial call.,HomeServe
"From start to finish Homeserve provided a great service. Easy process to book a plumber who was able to come out the next day. I was kept informed on arrival times, progress and further visits. Ahmed who completed the job went out of his way to make sure he did his best to fix the problem which was not straightforward and was very professional, knowledgeable and helpful. This was my first time using Homeserve and it was a positive experience throughout.",HomeServe
The booking system for my outside drain issue was really easy and I booked a slot for between 8am and 1pm the following monday - I got a call saying he was running late at 12.30 and would be with us shortly then another call saying it would be 20 mins and he turned up at gone 2.30pm - the engineer was excellent and sorted our problem out and I dont blame him as he was sent to another job before ours and he apologised several times BUT I had booked the morning slot on purpose and it meant a day was wasted.,HomeServe
I have dealt with Homeserve twice already and in both occasions the service has been of high standards. A call out to a blocked manhole and a claim to a broken water pipe that caused a flood. Very happy with the service.,HomeServe

Would highly recommend Homeserve.",HomeServe
The operative failed to ring before arrival and my partner was ill in bed at the time.His suggestion on viewing leaking wash hand basin taps was letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s renew them instead of a rewasher. No the wonder premiums are so high.,HomeServe
"The last engineer that came round knew his stuff. Can't rate Steve Atkinson highly enough. And hope he is sent round when the problem is not easily solvable. In this instance, the problem was granular powder aggregate in stand pipe, and not 'stones' as we were earlier advised.",HomeServe

No one knows what they seem to be doing. Supposed to be coming out today to fix a leak and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn up. Rang and was put in touch with the firm supposed to be doing the job to be told it hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been authorised. Then told by homeserve they got it wrong!! Been going on for 2 weeks now. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the point of a vulnerable lady taking out insurance with them?????,HomeServe
the chap found my water leak in my bath room,HomeServe
The bloke what came was really helpful. He checked everything out and explained everything to us And what was involved next He didn't fix the problem but we did manage to get a plumber who did But he was still very helpful and checked out everything so we could explain it to the plumber ,HomeServe

However, he was determined not to leave us without water and after cutting out enlarged hole in the kitchen cabinet, found not only a leaking stopcock but a perished pipe which he cut out and replaced with a plastic pipe. I am very grateful for his determination, skill and his concern for us. I cannot praise him enough",HomeServe
"The first plumber who came would not touch the job in case of asbestos. Your asbestos advisor said there could not be any asbestos because it was installed well after the rules changed - which I was telling the plumber!

"Very quick and efficient, friendly service right from the start from HomeServe. The subsequent investigation by the leak detection company S.O.S was absolutely brilliant. Our engineer, Octavian was thorough, conscientious and extremely helpful. He spent almost 8 hours at our property trying to find a leak and thankfully couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. We have since had no more issues with the drop in pressure and everything appears normal again.

"Problem solved quickly, really helpful plumber and drain men",HomeServe
"Our toilet flush stopped working completely.  The repairman did a superb job. He arrived on the appointment day, and fixed it quickly and very effectively.  Our only negative comment would be that the operative we spoke to initially, didn't seem to realise that the problem meant that we were unable to flush the toilet for the 5 days waiting for the repairman's appointment (other than filling water buckets . . .) - and this is our only toilet. ",HomeServe
"I found HomeServe very efficient when my kitchen sink suddenly blocked over a Bank holiday.

"The work was carried out quickly and efficiently when the plumber was able to call. However this was third appointment. I had to stay in all day the first day and was told after 4pm that an earlier job had over-run. A second appointment was organised for the next working afternoon and the same thing happened!

My running overflow tank was reported by a neighbour and concerned me very much. However this problem was soon and satisfactorily  resolved by a call to your call centre and the booking of a plumber. The plumbing engineer  replaced the offending part and greatly to my relief which fixed the problemI am an old lady living alone who was grateful for the courteous and rapid repair,HomeServe

"In replacing a bath mixer tap Homeserve's Ukranian plumber had to overcome the difficulty of the piping being extremely close to the wall. The job was by no means easy but he persisted with problem where I believe many other plumbers would have given up, and managed to accomplish the task by his hard work and resourcefulness. I was very impressed and he is to be commended.",HomeServe
The job was completed fairly quickly. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pity that the tec failed to tidy up waste and reinstate drain cover. I also found a plastic glove on my drive. ,HomeServe

"It was the Friday before bank holiday when the flush on my toilet broke.  I phoned and was told there was no availability until Tuesday, however after I explained I am a pensioner on my own the lady managed to get a plumber out to me the following day Saturday which was very kind of her. Jonathan a very capable and helpful young man arrived and did an excellent repair job replacing everything in the cistern.  He left no mess and did not leave until he was sure I was happy with the work. From start to finish an excellent and timely job that was very much appreciated.  Thank you very much to all concerned, I will certainly recommend you to friends.",HomeServe
"My hot water tap on the bathroom sink had seized up. Three engineers came at different times. The first made changes to both taps and reversed the opening on the hot water tap. When he left, the tap was spinning and I could not use it. The second came. He fixed the hot water tap but after he left, the cold water tap was spinning and could not be used. The third engineer came. He could not fix it. He offer to change the cold cold water tap with a modern stainless steel tap when all the other fittings are antique gold plated. Obviously not suitable. The cold tap is currently taped up so it cannot be used. I now have to buy a new pair of taps. HS said theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come a fit them. So, it is still to be sorted out. Incidentally, all three engineers had differing opinions on the direction the taps should openÃ¢â‚¬Â¦,",HomeServe

Clearing blocked drains isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a pleasant task but the amazing guys provided by Homeserve  made light of the problem and worked  professionally  to sort the problem out. Rather than just unblocking the drains they identified why I had a problem in the first place and went above and beyond to fix it. Such a huge relief. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t thank them enough - nor Homeserve for covering me. ,HomeServe
We had two engineers one came to our property at 2:30 am the middle of the night and stopped the leak the next day another engineer arrived at 11:11 am and did the repair first class couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask for better thanks HomeServe.,HomeServe

"he did a good job, there is no more water leakage",HomeServe
"Speaking to a computer is not the correct way to determine the nature of the problem. The engineer allocated to my problem was armed only with a plunger. Having determined that it would not solve the problem, he then had to call for back up in the form of another engineer who had a high pressure hose which he used to unblock the drain some four hours later. If I had spoken to a human being the first call-out could have been averted. This company charge a lot of money for this service, but I for one are not happy with it",HomeServe
"Quick, efficient visit by the plumber, who immediately identified and rectified the problem.",HomeServe

"I was happy with the speed of assistance arriving for a major sewage overflow. I was not happy about the Ã‚Â£30 call out fee. I was not happy after finding out that the sewer is Anglia Water responsibility, and should have been given the opportunity to call them, thus saving my Ã‚Â£30. Homeserve ripped me off in this instance.",HomeServe
The plumber was really friendly and explainedwhat he was doing. Good job.,HomeServe
"Your Engineer, whilst unable to take action directly was able to offer advice that has since proven very effective in relieving the symptoms of my plumbing issue. Very friendly and helpful chap.",HomeServe
"Reported an outdoor drain blockage Thursday evening on 09/05/2024. After speaking with an operator was advised quickest time slot was Tuesday 14/05 but they would re-check for quicker time Friday morning. Next morning I called them again and was placed on a preferential service due to existing health issues I advised them of. I was then given a new time slot for Saturday morning 08:00 - 13:00.  Engineer called on Saturday morning and attended around 08:30 - job was quickly sorted and all has been good since.In summary - a good service from the operators I spoke with and the attending engineer but a delay of even a couple of days for a drain blockage where the sink, washing machine and dishwasher could not be used seems too long when you are in this position. So service from the individuals is 5 stars but delay brings the overall rating down to 4 stars.  ",HomeServe
The njob was to clear a block in the sink in the bathroom. He couldn't do it,HomeServe

"I first made contact on the monday morning and was informed that the earliest a plumber could get to me was the Thursday between 0800hrs and 1800hrs which I accepted, come Thursday after waiting all day I called to find out whether he was still comming and was told yes however an hour or so later I receive a phone call to say that he  could not get to me due to unforseen circumstances and the earliest I could expect a visit was the next week I informed the caller that I was not happy as I had already rearranged the fitting of our new carpet once and I did not want to delay it for a second time, she then said that she could get one to me early on the Saturday morning which I was happy with which meant that we could get the carpet laid and the room straight the following Monday. The plumber that came was very polite, professional and efficient and fixed the problem promptly without too much water  leaking out - very pleased with the job that he did.  ",HomeServe
"The original engineer attended promptly but was ill-equipped to unblock the external drain. The second engineer, OVE, attended as scheduled. Weather conditions were adverse but he  remained fully committed to use all the resources at his disposal to unblock the external drain. He complained persistently about the lack of adequate equipment provided to unblock the drain quickly and effectively but his persistent efforts eventually paid off and succeeded. Well done OVE!",HomeServe
i requested a visit to check out a possible blocked drain back in May . Have had 3 visits so far from Home Service but each time the 'plumber' could not do the job either because they didn't have the right equipment or the expertise.I received a 4th text yesterday saying engineer will be here between 12pm-6pm and will call before arriving.I have just called to see where they are only be told they had called me on the phone; had banged my door and rang the bell but no answer. Funny that . I have been at home waiting since 12 o'clock ; had no phone call; heard no banging of door; heard no door bell.ANOTHER WASTED DAY.THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE PRACTICE.I do not pay a premium for this non delivery. ,HomeServe
"I explained to your call manager on the phone that we had a serious leak on our incoming mains water supply, and that we had located the position, which was under the floor in our downstairs shower room. A team was sent after the week-end to sort it out and arrived within the time slot. They were not very happy as they had been sent from Cornwall to Somerset, over 150 miles. They proceeded to dig ouutside the house, ignoring the fact that we told them that we had already dug there and that we knew where the leak was, inside the house. They found nothing outside! and when we showed them again where it was, inside the shower room, they said they couldn't do anything about that and they would write a report - and then drove another 150+ miles back to Cornwall. I was subsequently contacted by phone by a Homeserve  rep who said they couldn't do anything as under the T&Cs they needed ""access"" to the pipe  and said we had to strip out the loo, handbasin and shower and dig the floor up to expose the pipe before they would send anyone. (Strange ""access"" outside seems different from ""access"" inside??). I declined to do this as we knew where the leak was and none of the stripping out was necessary and said we no longer required Homeserve and we got a local contractor to do the work, which was completed in a few hours. Poor comms between your call manager and sub-contractor, strange choice of location of subcontractor and selective use of terminology ""access"" in T&Cs (ie they would dig outside but not inside) Our contractor made less mess excavating inside than yours did outside.",HomeServe
"Excellent service.  Plumber came next day and replaced leaking tap.  Arrived on time, very polite and efficient.  Fr",HomeServe
I called HomeServ on Sunday morning about a pipe leak. I was told a plumber would come between 9 AM and 6 AM - and wait for the whole day. At nearly 3 PM I was told the plumber can't come. Why did they not tell me this sooner? On Monday I said I wanted the morning slot because I had a hospital appointment at 4 PM. The plumber called at 5.30 PM. On Tuesday I was booked for a morning slot and the plumber called at 5 PM when I was busy. My kitchen pipe is still leaking and I am still waiting for the plumber. This is simply not good enough.,HomeServe
"Very good plumbers, prompt visit ",HomeServe
"Great service, called to arrange an appointment to unblock drain.Came out next day, all sorted and left clean and tidy",HomeServe

A blocked drain is never a welcome surprise but Homeserve were easy to contact and sent a plumber promptly. Although he was not able to clear it initially another team arrived the next day and solved the issue. I would recommend Homeserve. ,HomeServe
"Nothing went wrong. fault had cured itself!Plumber was fine, but not required.",HomeServe
"Problem solved quickly by very competent, tidy plumber.",HomeServe
"Despite being initially told that I would have to wait for a call back arranging an appointment within 24 hours and that it was likely I would have to wait until the following week, I received a phone call within the hour saying that an engineer would attend the leaking supply pipe that same morning. The engineer arrived and fixed the pipe within two hours. One can't ask more than that!",HomeServe
We had a leak discovered on a Friday afternoon.  Engineer (Graham Boardman) came out about 8pm but could do nothing until Monday.  Graham kindly turned our water off. Couldn't be helped.  We survived with help of a good next door neighbour.  On Monday father and son team (Alan and Zak Russell) turned up.  They could not have been nicer or more efficient and soon had the leak sorted and my pantry floor repaired where they had to dig.  My husband had not been long out of hospital with a heart condition and Homeserve and all staff were amazing.,HomeServe
We were experiencing what we thought was a leaking water pipe in the loft. Contacting Home Serve to explain the situation they arranged for a plumber to call later that day. He discovered the real problem as a hole in the felt under the roof tiles. This was not in his remit to repair but he did place a bucket to catch any water that might come through. It was later in the day after we had contacted a roofer that the cause was repaired and solved. We do thank Home Serve for their prompt and friendly service they gave us.,HomeServe
The plumber was excellent and l am delighted with the way the job was done.  I would be happy to see him again next time l have a problem.,HomeServe

The last man who came did not seem aware of what he was doing and did not discuss things with me and I still get some flooding in the area concerned. The two previous men who came out were superb and discussed things with me and their work is having tangible effects,HomeServe
Came out to repair a leaking toilet on same day as booked. Repaired toilet with no fuss. Lovely polite gentleman. ,HomeServe
I had problems with the over flow in my tank in the loft.  I had to call an engineer out twice as it turned out to be the ball valve. Saved me from having a nasty and messy water over flow!,HomeServe
Good job. Well done. Your plumber came on time. Very professional ,HomeServe
"I am extremely disappointed with the service provided by Homeserve. On two separate occasions, they failed to show up for scheduled appointments, leaving me inconvenienced and frustrated. This lack of punctuality and reliability is unacceptable for a company that is supposed to provide timely and efficient service.Furthermore, when I tried to make a claim for a plumbing issue, Homeserve refused to cover the problem, stating that the multiblock cold water valve is not considered part of the plumbing system. However, it is clearly outlined in their policy that the control valve is covered as it serves as a vital control in the plumbing system.Overall, my experience with Homeserve has been extremely disappointing and frustrating. Their failure to honor appointments and refusal to cover legitimate claims have left me questioning the quality and integrity of their services. I would caution others to think twice before relying on Homeserve for their home maintenance needs.",HomeServe
"Quick response, drains sorted very quickly.Engineer was very professional & helpful ",HomeServe
The lady who came to fix the blockage in my bathroom was very knowledgeable in what she was doing. She was very polite and explained to me about what she was doing. Thank you to the lovely lady.,HomeServe

I rang Homeserve as I  had a water leak in my bathroom. They came the next day and replaced the broken pipe. I was happy with the very quick service.,HomeServe
"The guy who came knew what the problem was within minutes,  this was then mended there and then, and...I got new taps. Thank you",HomeServe
A little disappointed this time. I made a second call after an initial first visit from an engineer regarding a leak. First visit was fine and recommended that we get a plumber as problem with the waste. As no doubt you are aware that is easier said than done nowadays . The earliest we could get a plumber was in 3 months !! I pay for homeserve to have peace of mind that someone will be able to help with a problem  even if a temporary fix . I was therefore still left with water coming through the ceiling hence the second call when I was hoping someone could possibly seal the waste as a temporary measure?. I was put through to someone who advised this was not covered and only pipework repair is covered. Whilst I understand exemptions in policies there was no offer to send anyone to recheck and see if anything could be done. Thankfully a work colleague got someone to help. It turns out a new waste pipe needed to be fitted. This has  been carried out and sorted the leak at a cost  but as you can appreciate I feel let down by Homeserve as a new pipe sorted the problem .,HomeServe
The plumber was friendly and efficient. It was a huge relief to finally lose the drip!,HomeServe
"The engineer that came was not interested in fixing the problem and didnt have the parts with him.  He first told me my taps were very old, which i had to correct him on and tell him the tap was only 2 years old and still available on the market as i had brought the same tap 3 weeks earlier for a new bathroom.  He then told me he would retro fit another tap of different shape and size to which i told him no as it looked terrible.  He then got frustrated and said he would retro fit a washer from another tap, which he did.  The issue was resolved, but the plumber who arrived was not easy.  ",HomeServe
The appointment was made easily and quickly. The engineer arrived on time and was friendly and efficient and our plumbing problem was soon resolved. ,HomeServe
"On the day selected for the visit i received a call as stated to let me know they were on their way. Durring the visit i was told what was being done. My rotten, leaky pipe was removed and replaced with a new sturdier pipe. Man who came was friendly and no nonsense.",HomeServe
Arrived within the scheduled time. Washers replaced and lubrication carried out on hot and cold taps. Work carried out efficiently and everything was explained to me. ,HomeServe
Brilliant. I rang about a leak on my bathroom and someone came that day. It needed two men and a part and they came back and sorted it as they said they would. Lovely workmen very polite and took great care not to let my cats out ! And it was bank holiday week,HomeServe
"The plumber who came to fit my new shower was brilliant. He was professional, personable and very expert at what he did. Could not fault him. ",HomeServe
Guy came on time and found blockage straight away was all done in less than  half hour very pleased ,HomeServe
The Engineer came on Time as planned.He repaired the water problem we have had.The Engineer was also polite.,HomeServe
"The engineer was on time found the cause of the leak in a few second and replaced the faulty part,  The whole process was quick and efficient with no cleaning up afterwards as the engineer cleaned up after himself",HomeServe
The engineer was polite explaining everything he had to do and carried it out in a professional way he is a credit to your company he explained he would do a report so I could pass it on to seven trent for he saw damage to a shared drain as well I've passed report on to Severn trent awaiting there reply ,HomeServe
"I made an appointment to replace my leaking internal stopcock. Unfortunately, the repairer came and found out my property had no external stopcock. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it job done from them. I was also advised by my water supplier that this could have been fixed by freezing the pipe. Sadly, Homeserve repairer donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t carry out that job.",HomeServe
"Overflowing sewerage  adjacent to back door and infront of kitchen. 2nd time in a week. First engineer said it was due to a communal sewerage so he wouldn't clear it. Yorkshire water came and cleared, said it was a problem on my property, and to call Homeserve if it happened again. 6 days later it happened again, called Homeserve, sent an engineer from Newcastle (I live in Hull), came in rented van without a jet washer so could not clear it. He called office and was told I needed to call and log issue again. Despite free sewerage flowing just outside backdoor, they cannot send anyone today, I am a nurse in NHS and working the next 3 days, 12 hour shifts and the insist I need to be present when they come ( drain can be accessed without my presence) They say cannot come until Sunday. All managers in a meeting, likely story! The service is appalling!",HomeServe
"Phoned Homeserve, Engineer arrived in thirty five minutes, at 5-35 pm we had a water leak from the bathroom, very awkward for the Engineer to sort out .Could not have been in a more awkward spot.He successfully sorted it ,and repaired the pipe ,he finished at about 9-50pm.He was very pleasant, helpful, and courteous,and kept us informed as to what was going on .",HomeServe
"As you can imagine a burst, underground water pipe outside our house was quite disturbing but booking a repair via Homeserve was straightforward and an engineer soon called to locate and repair the leak. The engineer who came (sadly I can't remember his name but he came from Hull) was excellent. He worked diligently, took care to inform us of everything and was both polite and amiable. The weather on the day was appalling but he continued to smile and solved the problem quickly and efficiently.",HomeServe
"I have been with home serve for quite a few years, and recently had problem with upstairs shower and sink. First problem is when you call you cannot speak to a person, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to explain what the exact problem is, is itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not quite straight forward. Day booked, plumber rang to say he was on his way, but when he got here said it was not a plumbing issue, it was the drain guys as it was outside. Well, as the toilet wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t blocked and they all run into same drain, I was unsure about this! He made an appointment for drain man to come who immediately said, this is a plumbing inside issue, not for me, plumber should have sorted it last week. However, he was kind enough to sort it out, shower pipe just full of (probably my hair!) He also advised to put mr muscle down monthly to avoid issue in future. Great advice. So, issue was sorted, but it took two visits, and the automated claims line REALLY needs attention. ",HomeServe
"I reported a possible leak in my water supply & 2 engineers came the same day (possibly on the way home) to assess the situation. A day was agreed to do the job & sure enough they arrived at 8am.The job turned out to be a bit of a nightmare trying to find the LEAKS -as it turned out - but all was finished by the end of the day, with everything back in place and tidied up to the point you wouldn't have known anything had been done. Great work by 2 dedicated workers. ",HomeServe
"the service was excellent your plumber arrived at the time he said ,and job was done by in my opinion a professional who new is job",HomeServe
"Great they came out same day to fix a leak, then came back 2 days later to do the extra work required. Polite and friendly.",HomeServe
"Arrived on time , identified the leak and worked tirelessly to correct ... A huge job as it was under the patio !!  but the quality of the work and skills of the engineer were just brilliant. I can only rate Homerserve 5 star but if more stars were available I would easily award ...  ",HomeServe
"Not only did Homeserve provide a plumber the next day but Adrian was so great and professional. My plumbing is outdated but he made every effort to fix and replace taps. He was helpful and charming and observant. He managed to also replace an ancient ballcock in my water tank and though I had to pay my Ã‚Â£30 excess twice, it was well worth it. ",HomeServe
PROMPT AND EFFICIENT SERVICE BY A VERY CAPABLE PLUMBER.  ,HomeServe
"Extremely disappointed with the service.  I booked a visit online and was given a date to attend.  Failed to show up and when I contacted them, I was advised the date had been changed as 2 operatives were required.  I explained that I needed someone out urgently as toilet was also now blocked.  They assured me someone would contact me within 4 hours.  No one called me and as I have a child with ASN, I had to arrange for an emergency plumber to attend.  On the date of the re-scheduled visit, only one operative attended despite being advised that two operatives were required.  I emailed over 2 weeks ago to complain and to date, I have not heard back.  ",HomeServe
Just set up an insurance policy for plumbing and the whole process only took 3 or 4 minutes. Super easy and peace of mind.,HomeServe
Fantastic service. The gentleman who came to my property made sure he found and fixed the problem. He was here for a while and made sure the drain was cleared properly. He got rid of excess waste in the drains without a fuss and showed me what the problem was. ,HomeServe
Leaking Kitchen Tap on Thursday phoned Homeserve No appointments until Monday advice given by Homeserve Girl on phone turn water supply off until Monday !! cancelled Homeserve policy.We phoned a local plumber Thursday evening he arrived 10 am Friday Tap repaired by 11 am,HomeServe
"Easy to book online. Plenty of available slots available for Engineer to visit. Friendly, on time Engineer who explained process he was taking to try and locate an outdoor leak. Result was he felt almost sure there was no leak and that the meter was faulty. Now awaiting decision from our water board on whether they will replace the meter as advised. ",HomeServe
I booked an appointment to free a seized up stop tap. After waiting 7 hours the engineer arrived and could not solve the problem as he could not turn the water off. He booked another appointment. On this occassion two people arrived but could not find where to turn off the water off and said Yorkshire Water were unwilling to assist but I would be contacted to sort out the problem. After hearing nothing for a few days I filed a complaint. A few days later I got a call out of the blue from the engineer who came out the first time asking if he could come straight away. He did eventually sort out the problem but not before causing a leak in my kitchen which also went through to the flat below. Although i accept that this was a genuine mistake  with supply pipes in flats not being straightforward the whole experience has been distressing for myself and my neighbour.,HomeServe
"So grateful to the HomeServe engineer who worked tirelessly to fix the many leaks in the water pipe work. It was unfortunate that one pipe hidden under the eaves had a hole in it bringing the ceiling down.

The sealant round the bath had gone and needed replacing and although this is not something Thames Water do plumber gave me some suggestions which I found very helpful as I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have known where to look.",HomeServe
Great attendance - three personnel with three vans to deal with a leak in the garden. This was after the initial man who attended when we couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find the stop cock and another when another man arrived to switch water back on to my washing machine. Five altogether - a very good service. ,HomeServe

He was here within a couple of days, Callum was very polite and thorough, he explained the issue clearly to me, set my mind at rest that it was not costing me money (I'm on a water meter). He even rang Yorkshire water for me to arrange for them to come out ASAP and lefte a written report that I could show them. I only wish they were as efficient, I'm still waiting for the repairs almost four weeks later. I've no hesitation in recommending homeserve, great company. Thank you ",HomeServe

sink basin waste replaced expertly and pedestal sink unit refitted with no dame caused,HomeServe
"Getting back to the Homeserve of old. Before the pandemic, Homeserve used professional plumbers who lived in the local area. Now they're still  using workmen who have no connection with, and no interest in, the local area.They usually seem more interested in getting back home on time rather than resolving the problem. Or they're apprentices who don't know what they're doing.On the last visit, things were a bit better. British Gas are looking for us to go with them at the renewal date. So please keep going in the right direction.",HomeServe
The call handlers were unhelpful & did not listen with appalling music whilst on hold.The plumbers telephoned before arrival which was helpful & the best service they could under the  terms of their contract but the service was inadequate to resolve a leaking tank as I AM STILL WAITING FOR A QOUTATION.The repairs in the bathroom however were much more successful.I have no complaints  about the plumbers the service offered by Homeserve is little more than a scam & unsatisfactory.,HomeServe
Very impressed. Engineer was pleasant and helpfull and fitted a new tap in minutes.,HomeServe

The second 'rep' came the next day and he couldn't do the job as his equipment wasn't' powerfull enough.The third 'rep' informed us that we needed a new toilet, he said that he would contact the makers by email to see if they still made them in the same colour, and he would inform us. We have not had any further info: We have made two phone calls to your office and they said that they would look into the situation and inform us. again no  contact. We are both in the 90+ age group and an upstairs toilet is very much needed due to the many calls of nature each night. Would you kindly inform us what the next move will be such as ?Do WE have to purchase a new toilet and have it installed by a contractor, or by your concern.We have received good service during the many years that we have been with you, but not so on this occasion.We await you relpy.Ray Burn.",HomeServe

"I was very disappointed,  the plumber was hardly 10 minutes to look at the blockage problem.  He left without solving the problem.  I had to call a neighbour to come and help out. My neighbour managed to unblock the kitchen drain properly.  However,  I am still having problems with my bathroom and toilet.  I still want to make a complaint about the service I got from your company. Please advise of who I should contact to make a complaint. ",HomeServe

I could not use the kitchen sink but she Told me to get a takeaway or microwave a meal then take my dishes upstairs to wash in the bathroom. I explained I am a carer for my husband who has had a stroke & I have heart problems but she was so dismissive of me. We are both in our Ã¢â‚¬Å“80Ã¢â‚¬Â,s but she said others are worse off than me & would have to wait over 24 hrs before the engineers could call. I appreciate others are worse off but the attitude was dreadful  for customer service!! The engineers did in fact come several hours later & were very good. They are due to come & finish the job on 1/2 July but it is not yet confirmed.",HomeServe
Efficient service. Informative and reassuring plumbing specialists. ,HomeServe

My call was answered quickly and dealt with quickly and efficiently with an engineer being arranged to come the following morning...Sunday! Relief!! The Engineer arrived bright and early the following morning, and after assessing the situation, quickly got to work to finding where the problem was and flushing everything through. He cleaned everything up afterwards and left the place spick and span and then gave me an overview of where the original problem was and what he had done to resolve it....and was incredibly friendly, polite and courteous throughout.

"Plumber explained what was going to happen and did so in an efficient, clean and tidy way",HomeServe
Your engineer arrived promptly and wasted no time in resolving my leaking outside tap. He explained why it had started leaking and quickly replaced the tap.  He left no mess,HomeServe
"We only took out Homeserve as it was on special offer, but from calling them out to a blocked toilet, the professionalism, friendliness and courteousness of all staff involved in resolving the issue means that not only now are we going to renew the policy, but have told friends and family how good Homeserve are. If only more companies could be run this way. Thanks.",HomeServe

The plumber was really nice and very accommodating. He done a really good job as requested. He was on time and very efficient. ,HomeServe
Easy to make appointment and quick to attend. No more smelly drain!,HomeServe
"I have had insurance with HomeServe for almost a year and have not had to call them for help until about 8 weeks ago, when really dreadful sewage smells started happening each time a tap was running or the toilet was flushed.  It was easy to book an appointment for an engineer to visit online, and I was pleased when the chap turned up nice and early on the allotted day, having phoned a few minutes before to let me know he was on his way.  However, he was unable to help fix the issue, as he said he only did external drains and he thought the issue was inside the house, so he suggested I book another appointment for an internal plumber to visit.  He explained that this would probably result in a second ""call out fee"", but as I still wanted the issue fixing, I went ahead and booked.  This time I booked over the telephone, as recommended by the engineer.  After this I received a text message saying that my appointment had been cancelled, so I had to phone again to ask why and make sure that an engineer would be coming.  Another appointment was made, and this time I received a test message confirming it.  Unfortunately, this visit was then postponed from the daytime to the evening, via telephone call, very late on the day of the appointment, despite having taken a day off work to be in (between 8am-6pm), the new time was now going to be 7.30pm.  At about 6.30pm I received another telephone call, cancelling the appointment, and I was told that I would get a text message with a new appointment in a few days.  The following day I did receive a message, with a new appointment day, again 8am-6pm.  Having taken another day off work, the engineer arrived this afternoon, though there was no phone call to let me know this time.  Clearly he was in a less than helpful mood, grumbling that it didn't state what the issue was on his ""job card"", and mumbling that it had better not be too complicated.  Sadly, after looking at the internal drains and a brief discussion, he concluded that there was not a lot that can be done, and I will just have to put up with the bad smells.  I have to say that this has all been very disappointing, inconvenient, frustrating, and poor service from HomeServe.",HomeServe
Plumber was extremely good did the job just fine,HomeServe
Easy to get through on phone and speak to customer services. And an appointment for plumber on the same day. Well satisfied.,HomeServe
Excellent and helpful service by employee who sorted out kitchen flood .,HomeServe
Major leak in kitchen.   Homeserve attended promptly and dealt with leak with minimal disruption even though leak was under a concrete floor.    Would definitely recommend ,HomeServe
Turned up said it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fall within remit and left. What a waste of money. The plumber wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t interested at all ,HomeServe
"Tough leak to find as I feared. Took two staff 4 hours each but they kept at it until located.Some damage was inevitable but they thought before acting, and kept it to a minimum. Speedy response. Great result, leak fixed. Thank you.",HomeServe

"I want to bring to your attention that the hand shower was leaking and the person who came to fix it blamed the seal around the wall. However, if the seal was the issue, how were we able to use the bathroom for an entire year without any problems? We were still able to use the rain showers without a single leak. It's important to hire experienced and motivated professionals. Please do not send people who are just looking for money and are not willing to put in the work. Homeserve just lost my membership.",HomeServe

"Very pleasant men came to assess the problem of the underground pipe to the septic tank. Unfortunately what the 2nd man found was a bend downward, which he said is not a break but therefore not a claim. I've been a long time client with HomeServe and, as a pensioner of 84, find the annual fee very high... So am sad to find I am not insured for this lowering of the pipe - probably due to weight of flood water, or whatever. Is there nothing that can be done to permanently help with this kink? I'd appreciate the best you can do. Kind regards. B Marsh.",HomeServe
The plumber did a very professional job ,HomeServe

"Great plumber, good advice. He re-fitted a new mixer tap but in the opinion of a plumber I consulted to fit a pressure reduction valve, he should have put a more robust mixer tap, especially as it was the second time it had to be replaced for the same reason.",HomeServe
"Reasonable service.Original date was delayed twice. The office assured me that a leaky tap could be addressed at the same time as the non-functioning toilet without needing to have a second call out. The engineer insisted that a second call out  (and charge) was required and so did not do the job. Perhaps understandable, but a common line would have avoided frustration. I fixed the tap myself in about 10 minutes.  The toilet cistern malfunction again about a week later. Overall a reasonable insurance for a major drama but not so useful for minor repairs - call a plumber.",HomeServe
"Took 3 visits from 3 different engineers, 5 days in total, to confirm they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix a leaking heating pipe. Meanwhile the leak was made worse, we had to call a plumber ourselves and we now have to make an insurance claim for the damage the leak caused during that period. Engineers seemed more concerned about moving to the next job than resolving the issue. ",HomeServe

Had to wait for the next day but no one came, even though was booked as an emergency. Was called to say too many emergencies and so would have to wait for the next day. Had a function to host but had to cancel. Lost deposits on things arranged. Cancelled my appointments to wait for engineer. Came in the evening and fixed the problem.Love Homeserve as usually perfect service, but this time, not happy.Hoping it was a one off.",HomeServe
"The plumber who came was very good, a  big job for the money, brilliant service ",HomeServe
"My experience with Homeserve rates from 0 from Customer Service, to 5+++ for the 2 engineers Wayne and Adam from Bradford, who after18 days of appalling service finally cleared the sewer drain that was overflowing from the drain next to my door. The first engineer didn't even take his hands out of his pockets, took one look and said the problem was not within my property boundry. Yorkshire Water visited, investigated and said it was definitely within the boundry, they said to call Homeserve, but they did clean the area and jetted the drain, to make it safe. The next engineer arrived....without a pressure washer? The saga went on and on, spent hours on the phone trying to speak to a manager. Formally complained twice, still awaiting a response. I took out this cover to protect me from exactly this situation. I have to say Wayne and Adam worked so hard, and managed to avoid digging up my driveway to clear the sewer of tree roots, they were so professional and did a thorough job- it's a pity that the rest of Homeserve does not appear to share their work ethic or commitment to customer care.But still no response from Homeserve! How can anyone be sure that this company provides the service that homeowners pay for? Will the 1st engineer who came be asked why he didn't do his job????",HomeServe
Was very happy with the out come of the work took longer than expected due to finding water shut off point but reu was very patient & did not give up  until completed the job thank you Ã°Å¸â€˜Â,HomeServe
Had a prompt response to urgent phone call re leaking hot water tank. Although engineer was unable to complete repair due to contract limitations he was able to give helpful advice so that I was able to resolve the problem. ,HomeServe
"So pleased with homeserve! Got home after our holiday to find we had a leaking stop tap Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€ the response time from calling homeserve to coming out was so quick - the same day and the plumber who attended was so friendly and talked us through what the problem was and what he could do to fix it. The whole experience from logging the claim to it being fixed was dealt with so quickly and without any fuss. Customer service was 5star, couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recommend enough. Thank you ",HomeServe
Very easy to book a technician but we were told that the leak is not covered by homeserve and we had to get someone else in to fix it anyway.,HomeServe
Too be honest we've had two men come from your company to sort a leak out in out lounge the first man did his tests and marked out where the leak was all ready for the engineer to take up the floor and repair it then he came and said there was no leak!! And didn't do anything but our carpet is still wet when the hot water goes on so I'm not very happy at all and I'm going to have to get our own plumber in to look at it which seems silly when we have pipe insurance ,HomeServe
"Plumber came on time to replace my kitchen tap, I had to purchase the replacement tap and it was like for like. When the tap was fitted it runs slower than the other one Ã°Å¸Â¤Â·Ã°Å¸ÂÂ»Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â‚¬Ã¯Â¸Â overall good service ",HomeServe
"The engineer that visited us was very knowledgeable and patient.  We had a blocked drain but having only recently moved in we couldn't find the manhole cover. The engineer's experience allowed him to narrow down where it was likely to be, and find it under some weed membrane and gravel next to the drive! Using a camera he was able to see that the drain was blocked with roots, and subsequently send a tool down to cut them away, blockage removed, all now fine!",HomeServe
Not a fan of automated phone calls but reporting my claim was surprisingly easy. Very quick response and the Engineer who completed the job was a true drainage expert. I would recommend Homeserve for plumbing and underground pipes cover to everyone. Well done!,HomeServe
Ian was a very competent and professional engineer who fixed the problem without adding to the flooding drama.Always receive an excellent service from Homeserve & always recommend them.,HomeServe
"Engineer called 15 minutes in advance of arrival, quick and easy fix to my leaking joint. Was there 20 minutes tops, very satisfied!",HomeServe
"Found the water supply leak and fixed it quickly, you would never know they had been there, such a clean job",HomeServe
"As usual their plumber arrived on time, was very efficient, completed the job without any hassle, left the place tidy, Recommended.",HomeServe
"As often seems to be the case, it was a Sunday morning when our attic water tank valve started leaking water. I called Homeserve, who confirmed it needed immediate attention, and they sent someone who arrived within two hours. He was a pleasant guy who identified the issue, and replaced the valve. It would have been virtually impossible to have found a local plumber to come out so quickly on a Sunday morning. Well done Homeserve! ",HomeServe
Friendly service but would have appreciated a bit more involvement in what was going on. Also being a plumbing job under the sink the extra water in pipes could have been better handled as it went under the cabinets and the wooden floors. But all in all efficient and quick. ,HomeServe
"We had a leaky tap and the job was done quickly and efficiently. The engineer knew exactly what needed to be done, very happy with the work. ",HomeServe
It took 3 weeks to sort out a major leak even SWater said it was outrageous and coming from them the service must be bad ,HomeServe
I've had to call the plumbers out twice they've come quickly solved my issues I really can't fault this company And I would recommend them,HomeServe
The plumber removed the blockage and mende the bathtap in a very profetional way. ,HomeServe
Was not very pleased with first appointment as was given the time of 8am to 6 pm but nobody came. Appointment time was then changed ( at 6.10 pm ) to between 5pm and 10 pm. As I had waited in all day I was not happy about this. When engineer arrived at 8.15 pm he did a good job of trying to find cause of leak.. but did not have sufficient time.Next appointment was 3 days later. Engineer did a good job of tracing the leak and resolved the problem.,HomeServe
"Homeserve came out very quick with a water leak, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m impressed !!",HomeServe
Plumber arrived at agreed time. Tackled work with  speed and ability. Results first class. Thoroughly satisfied.,HomeServe
"Dripping kitchen tap promptly fixed, with new parts. Engineer explained things and diagnosed the leakage behind bathroom shower. Well worth the excess payments.",HomeServe
Unblocked my drains ok prob happened a couple of times now put camera down said the problem was out of my boundary and to ring Yorkshire water as it was there responsibility they came out and checked with camera ware I was told the problem was and they said it was fine so one of them is passing the buck time will tell rang and cancelled first app didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn up day after then had to ring them again not good,HomeServe
"HomeServe took my call late on Bank Holiday Monday afternoon. Their engineer agreed an appointment for the Friday afternoon - 4 days waiting and at 5:30pm couldn't make it, a later time was offered until 10pm but  this was unsuitable for us! A new date and time were agreed Monday morning. The engineer came and checked that the leak had been stopped.  The main issue was waiting nearly a week for someone to call which is unacceptable? HomeServe could do better.",HomeServe
"The initial contact with Homeserve was prompt and positive. An appointment date was arranged to clear a blocked downspout within 3 days. I was subsequently contacted to push back the agreed date not once but twice so I eventually had to wait for 9 days for someone to come to sort out the problem.When the workman did arrive he was very helpful and efficient, resolving the issue quickly. ",HomeServe
"Very easy booking a callout to fix a broken toilet flush and got an appointment within 2 days. The engineer was excellent, friendly and polite and got the job done quickly and efficiently. We find Homeserve excellent and very reliable.",HomeServe
"We called because one of the pipes leading to the washing machine was leaking. The guy that came was nice but he reviewed very quickly, said it was the washing machine and left. The washing machine was new so that was not possible. We had to fix it ourselves. Not worth the Ã‚Â£30 I paid by any means. Will cancel this insurance as soon as the quote goes up.Adding this after HomeServe reply: the engineer was wrong. There was a pipe that was loose. ",HomeServe
The booking process was prompt. Had to wait several days for the  new tap which was then fitted by the engineer who was very competent and polite / friendly. ,HomeServe
Your representative did nothing to fix the problem. He merely emptied the cistern. My 2 year old Grandson could have done that|| Why am I paying a monthly fee when this is the response I get?,HomeServe
All good apart from the first appointment cancellation and a 5 day wait for a sewage pipe clearance ,HomeServe
"The professionalism and courtesy of the plumber were outstanding.  He was interested, motivated and determined to get to the root of the problem.  Outstanding in every respect.",HomeServe
The engineer arrived at the house within an hour of me reporting the leak from the cold water tank and had to turn the water off using the stop cock on the pavement and was gone within about 20 minutes.,HomeServe
The Plummer was very professional did an excellent job and on completion left the area spotless. Very happy with the service provided.,HomeServe
The engineer did a great job but arrived thinking he was going to repair the toilet when the reported leak was in the attic. This was down to problems with the automated service when we initially rang to book a repair. If we had been able to speak to a human being the confusion would never have arisen. ,HomeServe
"Easy to get through on the phone, which nowadays is easier said than done. And after a few key words with the Ai assistance l was through to a human being, wonderful.  The plumber came later that day and was very polite, friendly and had the leak sorted in no time.  ",HomeServe
"My seized internal stop tap was replaced without stopping water and interruption for the neighbours. Though the job wasn't straightforward, the engineer didn't give up and called a few places for support to finally find the solution.He was polite and professional and took care not to damage anything. He cleaned after he finished ",HomeServe
Although You were unable to do anything for me this time due to the fact that the cistern was cracked.I did get some useful contacts which led to me getting the New cistern installed and running the next day.,HomeServe
Fixed tap quickly and efficiently. Pleasant and courteous ,HomeServe
I needed to have someone round urgently fortunately within 24hourd I had someone round and managed to sort out the issue I had great service The reason itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 4star itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because having to wait from 8am to 6pm although the plumber came at 2pm but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an am waiting time or pm waiting time.,HomeServe
Phoned Homesere and they sent engineer to fix leaking pipe under sink  within a hour.He was very efficient and got the job done to a high standard.,HomeServe
"I have cancelled my policy after almost 10 years of paying out...the only time I felt I needed to call them out was because of a broken stopcock inside leading to the cold tap in the bathroom sink, only to be told, ""Naa! Your policy doesn't cover that because you can turn the water off with the inline valve""...I then turned on the cold tap to show a poor water pressure...the plumber then said ""OK, I'll do it this time""...So, I have cancelled my renewal of Ã‚Â£249, to be told that they could do it cheaper than last years, or even cheaper if I paid the first Ã‚Â£30 of any call out...I pointed out, so why is the policy Ã‚Â£249 if you can do it cheaper, why isn't that offered to your ""So-Called"" valued customer, there wasn't an answer so I cancelled.",HomeServe
The plumber was very good what he did  ,HomeServe
"We called Homeserve regarding a water leak on our drive . The following day they came to inspect the leak ,and 4 days later they came and repaired the leaking water pipe .The Homeserve staff were all friendly ,and explained what was going to be done .They were very professional,and fixed the leak in a few hours.All together a satisfactory experience .Thank you.",HomeServe
Technician came on time.  Inspected the pipes and explained what we thought was a leak was from condensation.  ,HomeServe
"Turned out that my policy does not cover showers. Fair enough - I suspected as much. However, not only did the plumber talk me through what needed to be done, HomeServe later refunded the call-out charge.  Since it was my bad, I reckon that's good of them.",HomeServe
"We called out Homeserve, to help us with a leak in the bathroom. The appointment was made on the automated system. When Homeserve arrived, he was on time and greeted us very friendly and professional. After we told him what our issue was, he informed us that he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help. We understood the reason why, he explained it very well. He did say he would get our excess back and he did. Just because they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help on this occasion, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll stop using them. ",HomeServe
"i called for a plumber because the outside of my kitchen wall was damp and algie had appeared on it, i thought it was the outside tap that was leaking inside the wall,the plumber came and was very pleasent and thorough, nothing was to much trouble, he found the problem which had nothing to do with the plumbing.",HomeServe
"I reported blocked sewer three days ago. The appointment has been already postponed four times. I am really desperate as we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use our toilet, no dishwasher, no laundry. I had to transfer my children to my friends place, I myself use public toilets as i am ashamed to ask my neighbours anymore. I took two days off to wait for the promised ingenieur appointment. I have no idea what to do. This coverage was a complete waste of money. I am going mental not having my children around and their customer service simply doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t careÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Update on my case: an engineer came today in the morning without tools or suitable equipment. He was at least as frustrated as I was. He told me, he is completely on his own dealing with angry customers and he can absolutely understand me. He arrived in the rented car with a stick and his two hands. Needles to say he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sort my problem. He was kind enough to call one of his colleagues who has a van with plumbing equipment but he cannot attend to my blockage before next weekÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I am in tears. He adviced me to complain by customer service. There is no point doing it. You cannot get a human being on the phone but a robot which asks the same questions all other again. ",HomeServe
Very quick in finding leak but would have been better if not so long to wait for a visit,HomeServe
"We found a leak behind the washing machine. It was a tiny hole in the copper pipe and was making a hissing sound. Luckily I had taken out HomeServe insurance a few year ago but had never had to use it.I phoned, talked to Hannah on the auto- chat phone line. I didn't expect things to go well to be honest. How wrong I was! An appointment was booked that afternoon, I was given a 5 hour window. The plumber called Matt phoned about 30 mins later and said he'd be with us within the hour. He fixed the pipe very promptly and left the area very tidy.I cannot recommend the whole service highly enough. So glad I had taken out the insurance when I did. Thank you.",HomeServe
Pensioners with blocked toilet downpipe. Called in the morning to Home Serve. very friendly engineer fixed problem just before lunch. Brilliant response.,HomeServe
The plumber was Kyle and he came at the due time between 12 & 6pm. He soon identified the problem and fitted two new ceramic valves. The tap is now drip free.Between 12 & 6pm on the 3rd June Home Serve sent me 30 email reminders that the plumber was due to visit us. It was very irritating to get so many reminders and very silly! Black mark against Home Serve.,HomeServe
The plumber that came was very good and polite and soon fixed my toilet that would not flush ,HomeServe
The job was completed to a reasonable standard.  I had to call engineer again that evening to reaor a dripping tap again which was not done perfectly in the first place. ,HomeServe

Found the 50p per month offer of Homeserve plumbing cover on my Anglian Water account page. Signed up immediately. The whole process was quick and easy (less than 5 minutes). Having had an internal plumbing problem which was a pain to fix it made sense to take up this offer. ,HomeServe

"After reporting the leak on my taps parts had to be ordered which meant that the engineer could not return to complete the job as he was on holiday. The second engineer did not impress me at all, fitting the tap valves to the wrong sides even though the manufacturers had previously given me the correct way to fit them and I passed this information on, this resulted in me having to get someone to fit the valves correctly.This engineer has visited my property previously and infortunately I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t impressed then.

On their last visit to investigate a leak in our loft it was realised  that the problem was with the roof which was not their remit.

If I could leave a 0 star I would this service covers absolutely nothing we have rats in the house the council say it's drain rats so must have a hole it a pipe somewhere contacted homeserve they said rat cover is extra and my policy is for leaks and blockages @Ã‚Â£17 a month I'd expect more cover than that as when I signed up at Ã‚Â£1.99 a month I was told it covered all plumbing and pipe problems I tried to tell them there is a leak as you can't have a pipe with a hole in it that doesn't leak they replied with find the pipe and we'll replace it absolute joke of a company I would honestly suggest you take your chances and either find somewhere else or just don't get cover ,HomeServe

"The plumber arrived in the time slot- having given me a phone call to advise me of his eta.He identified the problem immediately and dealt with it quickly and effectively.He was courteous, polite and smart.Thank you.",HomeServe
Terrible service and i do not recommend using this company. Firstly the plumber was supposed to arrive in the morning. He turned up right towards the end of the day without apologising. He then proceeded to take out all of the parts to replace the sink waste and couldnt put the new waste back together again. He was getting frustrated as 'the England' game was on and he wanted to go home but he couldnt fix the issue. He eventually gave up and said he would come back and booked in another appointment. Its now a week later and he has not turned up again even though i have waited for him all day at home. I have a job that requires me to be at the office to be paid and i have lost out on 2 days worth of work as i have had to take those days off and the issue is still not resolved. The customer service is also so so poor. Please look at alternate companies and do not waste your money here. This is not the first and i am guessing not the last time this will happen. ,HomeServe

Replaced our mixer tap,HomeServe
I had a thermostatically controlled bath tap replaced by Homeserve with one that was not thermostatically controlled. I had this tap removed by a plumber and replaced with a themostically controlled tap which means that the visit by Homeserve was a waste of time and I am now considering switching to another provider as I cannot see any benefit with this contract. The Homeserve plumber was very polite and not at fault. He was following company policy.,HomeServe
Blocked main drain.  Could have been quite distressing but Homeserve went above and beyond to get it sorted quickly in spite of it being not that straightforward. It required cooperation with Southern Water and an outside contractor { Blockbusters }  Very pleased with help from Homeserve operatives and telephone teams.,HomeServe
24/7 phone line; helpful customer service and very prompt visit by experienced tradesman to fix our plumbing issue. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve used HomeServe many times and well worth the annual premium for peace of mind. ,HomeServe
Sort out my blockage washing sink ,HomeServe
Plumber rang me 3 days before appointment and because I exposed the leak he was able to repair the leak  there and then when he only called to see what the problem was. Excellent ,HomeServe
HomeServe have always been great but had to wait 4 days this time for an overflowing stinky drain to be sorted. But workman was great and found the issue quickly and resolved it no problem. ,HomeServe
Really helpfull as a pensioner they put them selves out to get someone to fix my leak very quickly. I was kept I firmed when ther was a change of timeReally good service ,HomeServe
"The engineer was such a lovely man, very chatty and efficient at solving my blocked toilet and explaining everything to me. Job well done.",HomeServe
"The guy was very friendly and polite. identified the issue swiftly and replaced the taps with no fuss. he rang to say he was on route. Great asset to the company. I would give him 5 stars but he said there was a glitch in system, if you give him 5 stars it goes to 0. so he deserves 5 stars without doubt.",HomeServe
Had to call you out twice in two weeks as first call out didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t release the blockage so cost me Ã‚Â£60 in call out fees.  So whilst I am pleased with overall results not happy it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resolved in one visit.,HomeServe
"The men turned up on the day and time I was told, identified the leak dug down and repaired leak back filled hole and left the site as if nobody had been there, two very obliging and helpful young men thank you.",HomeServe
Homeserve have replaced our water supply pipe. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d had many leaks since last October (2023) with related failures to our internal appliances and an inflated water bill. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m content that the problem is rectified but have to question why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken 8 months and much cost to us when the solution was clear from the beginning. A significant factor has been a lack of coordination / cooperation between Southern Water and Homeserve.,HomeServe
As per the last call out for the tap problem the technician did a good job and repaired the problem in a clean and efficient manner and also very pleasant and courteous manner.,HomeServe
"Your service was swift after the problem of getting through. Hate answer phones. Job done satisfactorily but find I am one chrome fitting missing on radiator. I would  like this replaced if at all possible. It covers the fitting screw. Also he marked the wallpaper on my staircase. It is very narrow due to the rail for my stanna but he still carried all his tools plus hoover in one go. The hoover left black marks on the wall which I have managed to wash off, but I can still see the indentation made. Fortunately, no one else can see it as the wallpaper paper pattern hides it.",HomeServe
"A visit by the plumber was arranged promptly.The plumber soon identified the problem and resolved the issue very efficiently. At all times he was friendly,helpful and very competent.",HomeServe
There is a small he said couldn't smell anything and just put some eyes fluid foes the drain could have done that  myself and would not have cost me the Ã‚Â£30,HomeServe
"My water smart meter said I had a leak, but I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find it. The HomeServe plumber knew where to look and repaired it quickly.  Friendly, efficient, reassuring, equipped with appropriate spare parts.  A great relief to me and well worth the subscription.  I have used them several times over the years with no complaints. Thank you HomeServe.",HomeServe
Advice:  check your contract carefully as it is only simple to resolve plumbing jobs that are covered.  I am being charged over Ã‚Â£80 a quarter for a plumbing contract. I called them out to fix a leaking shower only to be told that I was not covered.  I was denied a refund of my Ã‚Â£30 call-out charge.  Also plumber did not turn up for first appointment so I had to wait two days for service.  I will be cancelling my contract asap. ,HomeServe
Sorted out the leak & no problems since ,HomeServe
The plummer knew his job and done it in quick time ,HomeServe
James sorted out the problem with the taps as well as a couple of other small things,HomeServe
"Called Home serve for a blocked pipe in relation to our toilet. Automated system told us the next available appointment was in a week's time. Finally spoke to a real person who booked an appointment for the next day between 8 am and 1 pm and took a payment for Ã‚Â£30 excess. No one arrived and we were then told they would be there by 6 pm. After cancelling dinner reservations for the evening we were still waiting at 7 pm and then after calling again were told they would not be able to come and rearranged for the next day. By then a neighbour who was experiencing the same problem, had called the water board and the problem was resolved overnight. We cancelled the call for the next day and have requested the return of our excess fee. Are still waiting for this to happen ",HomeServe
2 guys turned up to fix an intermittent leaking tap in the kitchen.The tap was not leaking while they were there and they refused to fix it even though we had paid up front for them to complete the job.There followed a 15 minute conversation and a phone call by them to head office and they then successfully carried out the repair in under 5 minutes.It hasnt leaked since.Up to the point where they actually fixed the tap they were not very helpful.,HomeServe
The appointment was easily made and kept.   The plumber was charming and very competent. ,HomeServe
"Made the call on one day the engineer came the next day and fixed a new tap, problem solved we were very satisfied with the service.",HomeServe

Serviceman arrived but unfortunately due to my drain being a shared he was unable to perform any unblocking as it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered by my insurance. How ever he did show me and explain what I needed to buy if I wanted to DIY, and also informed me of who to call in future which I did. So so helpful and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m great full for the professional service I received.",HomeServe
I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use the word Ã¢â‚¬ËœgreatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as the problem was apparently straightforward. The plumber advised me when he was on his way and got straight on with the repair and he was polite. ,HomeServe
I called in the morning regarding a blocked drain and they came in the next few hours! Consistently great service from Homeserve!!,HomeServe
Our appointment was postponed by two days because the automated service does not realise that there is no availability of plumber in the area. ( Prefer to speak to a human being) The person that came to fix our problem was very professional efficient and polite.,HomeServe
Once the plumber had arrived everything was fine and he did a good job.  However the appointment was very poor in that it was cancelled late in the day having stayed in for the aforesaid appointment.  We feel your administration side could be better.,HomeServe

"Making a claim was very easy, appointment booked for morning of following day. Plumber arrived on time with a great attitude.

An extremely lovely young man came to fix a hot tap that I was worried may cause the pipe to fracture. He called to advise he would arrive in 15 minutes and he did. He was extremely polite and replaced both taps for us. He left the bathroom clean and tidy and we are very pleased. ,HomeServe

"I had a leak from my shower which caused water to come through my lounge ceiling. The man who came out (supposedly a plumber) poked at the seal around the shower with a pen and said there was water underneath. He didnt check anything else. He wanted to turn off my water until I got it sorted and leave me with no running water anywhere. He told me I would have to get a private plumber out and left. I did and it turned out to be the waste pipe in my shower tray which I then had to pay for. I was charged Ã‚Â£30 for the call out which was no use to me whatsoever. I will not renew with them,would never use them again and would never recommend them",HomeServe
Was quick to find leek and quick resolving it ,HomeServe
"Our toilet, shower and bath were backing up. Paid excess for engineer to come out who did not do anything apart from say our toilet needed replacing as there was a limescale build up in pan (though this was clearly not the reason for the block as the shower and bath were also slowly draining). Had to call a plumber out and pay for blockage to be cleared. Policy is a waste of money",HomeServe
"Easy and quick to respond to my request.The plumber who attended was efficient, friendly and helpful.All sorted in a short time.Very happy with the service.",HomeServe

"He was very polite, knew what he was doing and completed the job required unlike the 2 previous  plumbers. His name was DJ.",HomeServe
"Although had to wait longer than expected for a plumber to arrive (reported Sunday, came Wednesday), he went above and beyond the call of duty.  Burst pipe hidden in false wall meant no water for 3 days. He arrived just after 14.00, and left after 21.30.  That's over 7 hours trying to sort out the burst pipe.  Really difficult space to get into, but eventually completed, so was able to have water again",HomeServe
"The young man who came to solve the problem couldn't be more helpful, he pointed out to where the problem could be,but checked all round to make sure the water didn't come from somewhere else.

The service from Homeserve was FIRST CLASS and quick - the technician was efficient and helpful. He tried  hard to clear the drain blockage but concluded that the problem was with the main drain (Anglian Water) and he was unable to help further. However he reported the blockage to HQ and Anglian Water and their technician visited early on 19 June and cleared the blockage. Thankyou so much for an excellent service and arranging for AW to attend. The air is a little less pungent in my household now and I am exceedingly grateful. Thanks again.  J Coll,HomeServe

An absolutely excellent job. You Engineers were friendly and helpful and knew exactly what they were doing. I would not hesitate to recommend Homeserve for any Plumbing or Drainage work. A brilliant job.",HomeServe
Engineer came on time but only stopped the leak and refused to do the repair because somehow a leaking toilet is Ã¢â‚¬Å“not coveredÃ¢â‚¬Â under a plumbing and drainage policy. The reality is that 90% of likely problems come from issues not covered by the policy. I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t renew. Save yourself the aggravation and put Ã‚Â£16 a month in a jar for a proper plumber to do a proper job. ,HomeServe
"Homeserve came 3 times before deciding what to do, when they dug down on my property close to the meter that had just been fitted a month before they found that it hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been connected to the lead pipe properly by SES. Just a little turn on the joint and mended. Not my fault but still had to pay my excess on the policy even though it was SES not fitting it correctly.

The engineer was extremely patient & persevered in spite of several setbacks and eventually managed to fix the problem - which was a huge relief as it appeared to have been leaking for some time before the damage began to showI have had Homeserve for many years now and was considering cancelling as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d only used it a couple of times - but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so glad I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t!

"The engineer came on time. I got help also from online agent to book the slot for engineer.The engineer said that he will book a follow up appointment to wash the drain pipes as it require further cleaning but till date i never got confirmation on the follow up appointment.Additionally, I had Ã‚Â£30 deducted while booking the appointment which was the access fee and it was never refunded.",HomeServe
"Initially I was disappointed that it would take a few days for someone to attend to our blocked sewer. I was worried that we would have raw sewage flowing down our drive. Luckily it didn't happen and the HS drainage engineer arrived on time as promised.After clearing the initial obstruction he investigated why it had been blocked and located a lot of debris which has probably been caused by rats. He could have ignored it but went the extra mile to completely clear the drain run, removing several bag loads of debris that he arranged to be collected later (it went within a couple of days).So, in conclusion, he did a fantastic job, above and beyond expectation and therefore 5 stars.",HomeServe
"Homeserve were prompt, polite and efficient. The leak was repaired and the part replaced quickly. ",HomeServe
I needed a plumber quickly and after contacting HomeServe he arrived within 2 hours and sorted out the problem.It was easy to book a plumber and the same day service was first class.,HomeServe
"Initially the service was excellent and the plumber appointment was quick.However, when the plumber arrived I found his attitude poor. When I showed him the leaking toilet and mentioned that two of our other toilets with same symptoms had been repaired using a washer (20 minute jobs), he said that he wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t try a repair until I had removed the tiles surrounding the base of the cistern.I, asked him if he would just examine the other toilets for leaks and his response was Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not working on themÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ very abruptly. I said I only wanted him to examine them.He left and I arranged for a local plumber to call. He replaced the Ã¢â‚¬ËœwasherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Bingo, problem solved.The supervisor who rang me following my complaint was excellent. Full of apologies and is arranging a refund of the Ã‚Â£30 excess.",HomeServe
Very helpful young man who sorted my sink and gave me excellent advice. ,HomeServe

Although the actual job of fitting new taps was done efficiently I would have expected to be asked to check if I was happy that the taps were working ok and area involved tidied up instead of the person just walking out the door.,HomeServe
"I was very impressed with homeserve. I had a problem with my toilet not flushing, so I gave homeserve a call. They have an automated call line which was easy to follow even for a technophobe like me and my claim was accepted straight away and a plumber organised for the very next day. The plumber arrived promptly and was efficient and pleasant. He was here for a good half hour and replaced my syphon amongst other things. All IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had to pay is the Ã‚Â£30 excess, which is a lot less than IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have had to pay if I wasnt with homeserve. All in all the service IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve received was 5 star and I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate to recommend homeserve to others. ",HomeServe

"I had a very high water bill due to a leaking pipe. Both Yorkshire Water and Homeserve were excellent. If the leak was on YWÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s property it was their responsibility likewise my property it was my responsibility.1. Both Homeserve and YW kept in contact with each other whilst the leak site was being determined. Both sides worked very well together and, as they talked on speakerphone I was able to hear the professionalism from both companies.2. Both companies sent their inspectors to determine. The professionalism and courtesy shown to me was excellent.3. I had my first Homeserve visit from Dave. He was interested, wanted to get the problem sorted, kept me updated throughout until telling me he felt the leak was on YWÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s property.4. To find where the leak was, Dave had to dig out a patch of my front garden. He did so with great care and attention. When returned to normal, you would not have known anything had been done.4. Unfortunately, the site of the leak was still unclear therefore YW sent out one of their managers. Again, he explained everything to me but determined that it was my property. Caring, knowledgeable throughout.5. Sam then arrived from Homeserve to do a final check. Again, like Dave, he was professional, knew his stuff and kept me updated. His decision was that the leak was on my property. There and then he phoned Homeserve and booked a day appointment with him and Dave. 6. On 28 June Sam and Dave arrived. The worked together, kept me updated and were a pleasure throughout. Finally, leak was located and sorted.7. To get to the leak, they had to remove floorboards. Once the leak was closed off, my floor boards were expertly replaced - and - my hall vacuumed. They even arranged for the rubble to be collected. 8. I cannot praise Sam or Dave highly enough. Their care, concern, knowledge,  courtesy and friendliness cannot be praised highly enough.9. Likewise the Homeserve advisors were the same. Warm, friendly, knowledgeable, interested and caring.9. YW kept in regular contact with me. Harry from YW would phone me about every two weeks to find out what was happening. NB this was not just a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtick-box exercise. It was because YW was interested in me and the job in hand.10. Likewise, YWÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staff were the same, warm caring, friendly, professional. ",HomeServe
"The plumber visiting did the job fine it seems to my satisfaction, but the following irked me somewhat :-He put his tools, like a drill, on my kitchen top work surface.This is something I use regularly for food preparation, so to avoid illness - in lieu of placing raw food on it - I keep it scrubbed clean....and he put his dirty tools on it ! This was quite annoying to be truthful !",HomeServe
Our engineer arrived during the allotted timeframe and called ahead to let us know. He informed me clearly of the plumbing problem we were having and how he intended to rectify it. He was very professional in his attitude and worked in an orderly manner. I was very pleased with the outcome and would recommend the service.,HomeServe
Came to clear a blocked toilet and completed that as well as a drain linked to it. Also explained how to get an improved communication experience with home care booking process.

There was leakage on two location. One job they did was not bad. They installed new pipe above ground and liner for under ground pipe instead to dig they used liner. Second time I call and drain was blocked and damaged and water was coming a lot Inside building. They unblock the pipe and water was flowing. But they did not fix the underground source of leakage causing water coming inside building.

Homeserve dealt with a leaking water tank really well. They were professional and considerate. The engineers Anthony and Wei were fantastic. They worked really hard to get our hot water and system up and running in a difficult small loft space. They did a great job replacing the cylinder and installing a new one. I also want to mention Carl Baldwin who was very helpful. I am so grateful to all the team for all their effort and hard work. Based on our experience I would highly recommend Homeserve. ,HomeServe
"Excellent service, plumber really helpful",HomeServe
"I had 2 jobs booked. Both of them were rebooked last minute by the provider multiple times. However good communication were throughout. The problem was fixed, but first engineer left lots of mess and sealant around the toilet absorbed all the dirt, it was very poor service. Second engineer was respectful and friendly, wore shoe covers on my carpert, compare to the first. Appreciate that. However refused to to replace leaking sealant around the bath. Not sure about the policy there, was surprised  why the sealant around the toilet is covered but around the bath was not. ",HomeServe

"We were without mains water. Initially given an appointment for 6 days time!! Explained again, no water. Scheduled then for same day 12.00 - 18.00 hrs. Then at 16.00 hrs advised the engineer would not get to us today. Engineer, who was excellent when he came arrived at 11.00 the next day. There seems to be limited flexibility in terms of scheduling, clearly lacking resources to meet demand in this area. The definition of emergency is too narrow, no questions re vulnerability of residents etc. ",HomeServe
"Quick response to my telephone call, followed by a prompt arrangement of a visit and very efficient resolving of the plumbing problem.",HomeServe

After multiple revscheduals they finally came out to my address. The chap was very friendly but said he could not get to the pipe and not to worry. As the pipe was built into my main wall. The guy that came out first could of said that it was no accessible. This cost me the call out fee to be told nothing that could be done after multiple re scheduled appointments.

I have had a recurring blocked toilet wastepipe issue for many years which my husband used to deal with! Called Homeserve this time to sort it and they did and also identified the cause. Craig and Aaron came back the following week to dig up and re-lay the faulty waste pipe. Fabulous job! ,HomeServe
HomeServe suggested replacing pipes following a report of low cold water pressure upstairs. That meant taking out tiles and damaging my bathroom. The visit was not even followed up by HomeServe to find out how I would want to resolve the issue but I got bombarded with Review emails.Anyway I had to pay for a plumber outside HomeServe who resolved the issue within 2 hours and without removing the tiles or breaking up my bathroom ,HomeServe

We phoned Homeserve and got an appointment on the following Monday.  I stayed in all day and got a phone call at 5.45pm to say the plumber couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make that day.  We were out the next day.  We were told Wednesday between 8 and 1.   I got a phone call at 11.45 to say the plumber would now come between 12 and 6pm.  I was livid because I felt because it was a small job we were being pushed to the end of the day.  We pay a lot of money for this service, as well as an excess fee.  This latest experience has made me think about cancelling next year.",HomeServe

"I arranged an appointment to have a drain unblocked at the side of my house and I was told I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered as there is a bit of cement near the drain and just by looking he could tell it was a third party issue. I informed the gentleman that I had previously had my drive done to which he responded Ã¢â‚¬Å“you need to get them back to fix it, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not our problemÃ¢â‚¬Â I have been unable to contact the company I had in to finish my driveway let alone to come and fix a drain that may or may not be their fault. My husband informed me afterwords that they rinsed off into the drain at the bottom of the drive and not the blocked drive. I am very unhappy with the response and got the feeling that the gentleman did not want to even investigate and blamed work we had done straight away from a blob of cement near the drain. Reply from HomeServe UK2 hours agoHi Lisa,I can see that our Engineer did attempt to clear the blockage; however, the cement had gone around the u-bend, confirming that the issue had been caused by the company that had done your drive.We don't repair issues caused by third parties under our policies and this is something that you would need to take up with the drive company.BenHere To Help TeamHi Ben thank you for your response. How can the engineer be sure the cement was caused by the driveway company? My husband and I were making planters just a few weeks ago with cement so it was more possibly us that did the damage. Lisa",HomeServe

Had broken kitchen tap and was able to make an on-line appointment for next day. Plumber arrived within appointment slot and was remarkably quick in fitting two new kitchen taps. He was in and out of my house in less than 15 minutes. Big contrast to an advertised plumber who I called out about 6 months ago to fix my bathroom tap who took over an hour to do the job and left me with a large bill. ,HomeServe
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to give a huge thanks and recommendation to Dave from Homeserve who came to clear our blocked drain. He needed a return visit but gained enough information on his first to return knowing what the situation was and fixed it competently and completely - though it took him three hours on a Saturday!

"I rang HomeServe for advice on a water leak.Within minutes I was given an appointment for an engineer to come to my house to assess the problem.Once the problem was found, the HomeServe engineers got on with the job and continued all day until the issue was resolved.What a diligent team of engineers.Job done, problem solved. Great. ",HomeServe
Excellent service.Appointment the next day for drain service.Which was sorted out quickly and efficiently.I was very pleased with the service ,HomeServe
"Five stars for a reason!One star: Reported a leak and got an appointment straight awayFour Stars: The very intelligent, incredibly professional workman arrived, and straight away was not afraid to get his hands dirty! He was like Sherlock Holmes working out where the leak was coming from! So methodical and incredibly qualified as worked in the business for over 20 years. What an absolute credit to your company this guy is! I wish the big water companies would take a leaf out of your book, and employ the same skilled workforce. Well done Gary, and thank you Ã°Å¸â€˜Â ",HomeServe
"On a Saturday the feed pipe of an outside tap was leaking into the cavity wall area, soaking the outside wall to the extent it was visible on the brickwork. This could easily have caused serious damage.  The online claim experience allocated a plumber for the Monday which was too long and not what I expected from this service. However, a 'phone call to the customer support and Homeserve had a plumber to me at on Saturday evening. He was very helpful, fixed the problem by torchlight and returned on the Sunday to check everything and finish off. I was very impressed with his work and attitude.In summary,Positive - all dealings with the help line and the plumber.Negative - the computer work allocation system was disappointing and not what I expect from an expensive 'emergency' service.Overall - a service worth paying for, but sidestep the automated systems!  ",HomeServe
Friendly helpful plumber solved my problem thank you,HomeServe
"I recently had a leaking pipe in my home, and Homeserve did an outstanding job fixing it. From the moment I called, they was professional, punctual, and extremely knowledgeable. Homeserve quickly diagnosed the issue and explained the necessary repairs in a way that was easy to understand. The work was completed efficiently, and the area was left clean and tidy. I was impressed with their attention to detail and commitment to quality. I highly recommend Homeserve for any plumbing needs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a true expert in their field!",HomeServe
Plumber left my bathroom in a complete mess,HomeServe
Really good service. Prompt in answering my call. The homserve workman was so friendly and helpful. Went above and beyond to explain the blocked drains and the next steps to be taken. ,HomeServe
"Called out for blocked kitchen sink waste pipe.  First guy ""cleared"" it but a few days later it was just as bad again.  Rang up expecting a bit of a wrangle over having to pay the callout charge again but as soon as I explained they said ""it's the same job so no charge"" and it was fixed properly the next day.  No fuss and no extra charges so pretty good to my mind.",HomeServe
Very personable plumber who explained every step of the job and went out of his way to fix the issue.,HomeServe
"I will only leave a positive review if it is deserved, and on this occasion it certainly was.We had a gent (Craig, From Nuneaton )come out from homeserve to check our drains on 28/06. We were having a smell coming up through the kitchen sink. He was able to diagnose the issue straight away and advised us that some work would need to be done to repair the issue, and it would be a 2 man job and it would take a day to complete Craig also said the chap he works with would be the man to help out to do the job.He then made the phone call to head office in front of me and got the job booked in for a week later so that both of them were available.Craig and his Colleague turned up just before 8. my partner had to leave for work. On her return from work, the work had been completed and you would never of known they had even been at the property. All the decking was put back down, area was swept and rubble removed.Both of them were polite and courteous, and respected her property. Highly recommenced. If you are from the Coventry or Nuneaton Area ask for Craig. Top man. And thank you again.",HomeServe
The plumber was professional and friendly and unblocked the sink and fixed the stuck plug ,HomeServe
"Having received a large water bill, it was discovered that I had a toilet that was dripping, very slowly & quietly. So I arranged a call out with Homeserve.The ball cock was changed and the guy went on his way.I was awoken in the early hours hearing heavy rain. But no, it was the toilet pouring water down the pan.Another morning phonecall, and another visit that day. This time everything in the cistern was replaced and limescale cleared. Great job done. Otherwise it would have been 5*.",HomeServe
The man who came was very nice but couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t completely solve the problem .so we have now got a local plumber coming across to have a look and hopefully finish the job so we no longer have a leaking sink.,HomeServe
"My downstairs toilet, which has a dual flush button, was stuck and would not stop filling up at 6pm on Tuesday so I turned off its isolator tap. After investigating the problem I thought it needed a new push button. I had Homeserve Water and Drainage Cover so I rang them at 6.15pm. The helpful telephone agent said he could try and get someone out today which I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expecting. Within 3 minutes of my telephone claim a Homeserve plumber rang me and said he could be at my house in 30 minutes. He duly arrived on time, diagnosed the problem, and then fitted a complete new toilet system which he had in his van. He was here 30 minutes and was very professional and friendly. First class service for only a Ã‚Â£30 call out fee including parts.",HomeServe
Plumber arrived day after phoning on time replaced tap quickly with no mess very polite man,HomeServe

"A house guest managed to jam my bath plug down too tight. This was last Sunday. I couldn't make a homeserve appointment until Tuesday. On Tuesday, the plumber tried to prise it up with a thin knife (as if I wouldn't have tried that already) and said that it would be a 2 hour job. He booked me in for a slot Saturday starting from 8 am.Long story short, they never showed up. I tried phoning several times and one of the staff even told me that I don't have an active account (I do, which he eventually found.)I was rescheduled by text for between 12 and 6 today. At 5 :30 a dispatcher called to tell me that the engineer had said that the job would take 3 hours , he didn't have the parts etc (all without looking at the actual job). Homeserve want me to reschedule for a weekday (expecting me to take a day off work??) having kept me waiting in literally all weekend. Meanwhile, I've had to shower at a neighbour's house for the past week. This is supposed to be ""emergency cover"" and costs me Ã‚Â£400 a year.  They obviously don't have enough staff to fulfill their commitments",HomeServe

"I am so disappointed and disillusioned with Homeserve. I have been with HS for many years and used them once a number of years ago. I called Homeserve a couple of weeks ago as I had noticed a damp patch in the ceiling. It was obviously coming from a leaking bathroom pipe. The Assessor came and said Homeserve could only repair a leak and could not investigate where the leak was coming from. He further said that I would have to open up the ceiling and he could sort the leak. But, Homeserve would not arrange for any covering repair. He further stated that they would not even replace silicon over joints. I told him that I would now consider stopping Homeserve as I was unaware of their limitations. He further said it was in the T & CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. I did check them and could not see the limitations he had alluded to. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the point of home serve if you have to cover up any decoration e.g silicon. He left and said I should get the plumber who had installed the bathroom over a year ago. ",HomeServe
"I called Home Serve for a plumber to clear a blocked drain and adjacent toilet but the man arrived 3 hours after the scheduled time and said he wasn't a plumber. However he did clear the blockage.The monthly payments leave me wondering whether I am wasting my money, and in addition I had to pay a Ã‚Â£30 call out fee which I think should be refunded to me.

"We rely on our immersion tank for hot water, and we weren't getting any!A telephone call to HomeServe brought us Carl the plumber the next day. He divined that we needed a new tank which had to be collected from 60 miles away. He collected it.Meanwhile Matt, a fellow plumber removed the old tank and spotted that the airing cupboard floor was subsiding. So he replaced the floor.We now have a lovely new tank to replace the 44-year old predecessor, on a safe floor, with new element and thermostat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ AND HOT WATER!All this was done by excellent workers with patience and gentle humour. THANK YOU HOMESERVE.",HomeServe
"The young plumber was so helpful, nothing was too much trouble for him and no big rush to get away.  The callout was for a blockage in the washbasin circuit but after clearing the problem one he made sure that all other basins, shower and bath were flowing freely. he also found a small leak under the blocked basin and fixed that.

"I cannot recommend Home Serve UK enough. So simple to arrange a visit.  The plumber arrived on time, was very polite and very efficient. He managed to sort out my problem in no time.

A great tradesman who carried out the repair to the cistern with great craftsmanship.. Ã°Å¸â€˜Â ,HomeServe
"Despite additional information left re type of toilet - saniflow  your artisan was coming to deal. Paid the Ã‚Â£30 excess, only for him to arrive with no prior knowledge.

Why not tell me this when appointment was being booked to safe money and time of everyone involved? Quite disappointing and frustrating. ",HomeServe
"Plumbing problem, Easy to make appointment and very prompt call out and repair. Well done",HomeServe
Engineer arrived on time and did a great job.  I would award him 5 stars but the booking process wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t great which brought down the overall score.  We had a drain blockage in an outside drain but the AI booked us a plumber.  I phoned and spoke to an operator who solved the issue and booked the correct engineer.  Maybe utilising people rather than AI would be more efficient in the long term?,HomeServe

gentleman came changed washers hot water tap still leaking,HomeServe
"A young man came out and unblocked my kitchen sink as I requested. However, as I had removed the u-bend earlier to check whether there was a blockage in it that I could remove myself, it inevitably moved the plughole in the sink slightly which caused water to leak from it.  I thought to correct this would involve a big job.  What I didn't know at the time was that the small screw that kept the plughole in place just needed tightening up.  This I found out later from the man who subsequently arrived.  However, because that constituted a new claim (bearing in mind it only involved the turning of a screw), I was absolutely appalled when he said it was technically classified as 'another job' and therefore another claim would have to be made.  Nevertheless he did help me with it, but did not tighten it sufficiently, so I had to do it myself when he left.  In other words he didn't put any leverage on it, because he remained kneeling on the ground and only raised his hand over the sink to tighten it.  If I had known from the beginning that this was all it required, I wouldn't have even asked him for help, but as I am unfamiliar with the pipework of a sink, I therefore enquired about it - something he could have told me himself so I could have dealt with it, as opposed to getting him to handle it and then making it known to me afterwards.  What this episode shows is how restricted your employees are in their working practices when helping someone with something that is effectively part of the workings of the kitchen sink.  There didn't seem to be any willingness or curtesy extended to help a client with something that was incredibly small, by comparison to unblocking the actual sink.  In other words I was made to feel guilty over it.  What Home Serve needs to learn from this is to allow their workers to be more flexible in their approach to helping a customer and not assume that every deviation from the job (however small) should be seen as another claim.  It goes without saying that his visit (the first with Home Serve) left a very bad impression on me in how they operate!  If you put money before service, you are on a slippery path to no-where!",HomeServe
I had a problem with my toilet not flushing. I phonedHomeserve who answerd immediately. They quicklyorganised a time which suited me for a person to come and fix it. He came promptly and did an absolute firstclass job. He was extremely polite.I highly recommend Homeserve to anybody,HomeServe

"I could feel o total blockage in my drain with my hand of fat and other stuff. The man turned up, poked a thin stick in it allowing it to run and told me to run hot water into the drain on a regular basis always and left within 5 minutes of arrival. He seemed disinterested in the root cause and did not try and flush the main blockage. I fully expect this problem to re occur.",HomeServe
"The operative arrived punctually on the appointed date, and was cheerful and helpful throughout the visit. Our system was given a thorough examination and no pressing problems were found. We talked at length about preventative measures, and before leaving he put an access point and plug into the soil pipe so that I could inspect for, and deal with, any potential blockages.",HomeServe

I knew I had to do something quickly as it came from the bathroom upstairs. Apart from turning off the mains water supply in my kitchen, I had no idea what to do next. Fortunately, I was a member of Homeserve. I located their number online quickly and after giving my membership details they sent a plumber round to my house within 2 hours of me phoning them. The plumber was polite friendly, and knowledgeable and replaced my leaking 110mm straight flexible wash closet pipe within an hour of being at my house.

"Your representative informed me when he would be arriving and was very pleasant and helpful.  He dealt with the problem by replacing the isolation tap under the sink, which was leaking.  He considered the drainage pipe from the sink was too low and probably the cause of my dishwasher back filling when not in use.  He fixed the pipe higher to prevent this happening.",HomeServe

The engineer arrived Sunday took a look at a puddle of sewer waste and foecal matter on my living room floor then informed us we wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a drainage engineer till the following day leaving us in a very unhealthy situation. Once he left we contacted United Utilies who came out in just over an hr , investigated and rectified promptly.

Very quick appointment and a professional fix of water leak.,HomeServe
"The plumber was late as he turned up in the afternoon however it was an AM appointment. He then announced he couldn't fix the 3 leaking toilets because he only had one job number which was to fix a faulty tap which he did satisfactorily but never the less I still have 3 leaking toilets as identified by Anglia Water.Further to my review and the response received from homeserve I would like to clarify the following:I am temporarily bed bound as they know and I have to arrange for a volunteer to be available to let the plumber in, so in actual fact the slight delay (of which I was notified at last minute.com) wrecked everyone's day waiting. I made sure with the office staff that they were aware that all three toilets are leaking so to my mind the person I was dealing with raising the claim he should have booked the visit accordingly. Actually I took out boiler cover at the same time with Homeserve instead of British Gas,, nothing has changed in the garage but this year the engineer again arrived late and said he couldn't carry out the boiler check up as he couldn't access it (funny British Gas did), so I still don't know if it's covered or not and is this yet another job number not completed as booked, personally I find this type of treatment to anyone let alone a disabled person is not acceptable behaviour/ professional and there are serious training issues that need reviewing. The actual engineers/ technicians doing the job are very good and helpful.",HomeServe
"HomeServe provided a prompt and effective service in sending a fully qualified plumber to unblock the drainpipe from my downstair toilet.

"Home Serve were great all the way through. All their staff were very helpful.

From start to finish went like clockwork plumber arrived on time sorted the problem within 30mins or so excellent job really good service and plumber excellent. ,HomeServe
When booking you don't speak to a person. My husband has a stoma so needs our toilet frequently. My toilet was constantly running water through the system and the flush wouldn't work. I had to wait 2days for the plumber! The noise from the running water kept us awake for 2 nights. We only have 1 toilet in our house an it was extremely awful to try and cope with. The plumber was lovely and took him only 5 minutes to fix! It is a good job that I am not on a water meter!,HomeServe

"Got up Saturday morning (my birthday) to find all my drains blocked and bath with dirty water in.  Called out Homeserve and a very pleasant guy turned up and spent an hour trying to shift the blockage, but it needed jetting and as he hadn't one on board.  Another guy came out and cleared it with the jetting.  This was an enormous relief to me and allowed me to at last get on and enjoy my birthday.  Superb service and two very pleasant and helpful workmen.  THANK YOU.",HomeServe
"I rung up,water was trickling from a joint under the sink. It was arranged for someone to come out. She arrived quickly and soon fixed the problem. Thank you",HomeServe
Plumber recognised the problem and fixed the leaking toilet immediately.The toilet was electrical and he did say that this wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered under the policy but said he would look at it as a favour .The problem was a washer that needed replacing so would hope that in the future should the same thing happen that I could ring homeserve requesting a plumber to call ,HomeServe
Could not fault the men that came to unblock my drain they were fantastic done a brilliant job would highly recommend.,HomeServe
"The plumbers that came out were very friendly and helpful. However they did not fix the leaking tap as they did not have the correct barrel type seal to do this. I understand that taps are not the same, however having paid the additional policy fee I thought they would have been able to source the correct seal and then came back to finish the work.

This meant 1 plumber could do all the jobs in 1 visit. As this meant a return visit for parts the next week to complete the job 4 days later with the same plumber, this was very beneficial. Very pleased with the service all round.Keep up the great work.",HomeServe
Absolutely straightforward to apply .Cover is great and the introductory offer makes it a no-brainer really . Who knows when the plumbing in a 60 year old property might decide to to do something antisocial?Well worth having cover in my opinion .,HomeServe
The plumber arrived on time found the problem and fixed it quickly.,HomeServe
Our drains were blocked and I think your employee's  name was Daniel. He did a great job and went above and beyond what was expected.,HomeServe

As I expected I got a call to give time of arrival and the plumber dealt with the two issues I had effectively and with courtesy. This is sadly lacking with other companies today.,HomeServe
Engineer arrived promptly and repaired the leaking radiator pipe efficiently.,HomeServe
We booked for a leaky toilet on a Sunday it was arrange for a plumber to come out He arrived when he said completed the job checked 2nd toilet did this with a smile on his face ,HomeServe
Quick response on the initial phone call & extremely nice guy put us at rest that we were covered & arranged a next morning visit. The plumber had a difficult job getting under the shower unit but no complaints at all & he found a couple of issues & resolved them flawlessly. Both operator & plumber were a real credit to the company. ,HomeServe
"Pretty good service!The sewer was blocked & flooding my garden, originally booked via the app, they even had next day appointments!   The guy that attended called when on route, was early, cleared the issue quickly & hosed down after (that area doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t drain so it all congregated in a goopy puddle (I have 2 dogs & a cat) but he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put anything down to kill any germs etc although after me asking how to make safe, he did give me a couple of chlorine tablets to wash down when drained. He also gave me helpful advice on Thames WaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s responsibilities. The only other negative was that to change my appointment, it couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be done via the app so had to call. However, answered quickly & changed no problem.   ",HomeServe
Prompt efficient service when our piping sprung a leak while we were away and returned to flooding on the ground floor of the house.,HomeServe
"The operative who attended was really pleasant and polite, identified the cause of the leak straight away and resolved /fixed the issue in no time",HomeServe
"Will was punctual, very polite, and, more to the point soon established the main cause of our flooding. It took him longer than he anticipated but he has hopefully stemmed the flow. Unfortunately for us we are now going through a house insurance claim to put all the damage to right.",HomeServe
"Water leak on toilet flush, called for an appointment, plumber came within 4 hours and fixed",HomeServe
"Rang to report a blocked outside drain.  Within the hour, not only had the report been logged but the plumber had not only contacted me but actually travelled from Cardiff to Swansea and made the repair.  Can't ask for better than that.",HomeServe
Arrangement for visit of engineer went well although some confusion as to timing of visit by engineer.Engineer viewed problem and released drainage blockage. Hopefully work has been successful as previous blockages have recurred over time. After 7 days drain still running free. ,HomeServe
"Punctual and helpful, checked the drains efficiently despite a problem with the drain cover, provided useful advice  ",HomeServe
Very efficient service customer service excellent. The Plummer did not have any silicone sealent so had to provide some after running down estate to my brother in laws phew Ã°Å¸Â¤Âª!

"We had a burst pipe but had to wait until the next day for a plumber to attend. They arrived in the late afternoon but located the pipe with difficult access. A lead pipe specialist also attended and the e job was completed in 2 hrs. We were very happy with the two plumbers who were local to us and worked very quickly. Thankfully, the damage was limited to cosmetic decoration.",HomeServe
The whole process to fix my leak took 3 weeks as they cancelled two appointments in a row and then when someone did turn up they left without finishing the job and I had to wait again. To make matters worse my last appointment they gave me a date and then changed it. I work partly self employed and had to re arrange and cancel so much work it was an absolute joke and I was beginning to think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never get it done. I cannot fault the engineers who fixed my leak as they were polite and really did a good job. ,HomeServe
The technician was prompt and professional - and above all fixed the problem (a leak!) with a minimum of fuss. The problem is resolved. We should have taken out HomeServe insurance sooner!,HomeServe
The gentleman that came out to repair my drains was outstanding really helpful and polite and did an excellent job. My only gripe was the lady I spoke to first tried to tell me I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered and basically said she couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do anything to help me it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t till I spoke to another advisor that she said I was covered ,HomeServe
"He was a lovely man very polite and friendly, needed to put a hole in the celling to find out where the leak was coming from? turns out he never needed to do a hole in the ceiling as he found the problem was the taps was leaking and just needed changing now we have a hole in the celling for no reason which was a little annoying ",HomeServe
"Apart from having to deal with the ""Automated assistant"" once I could speak to real people we received excellent service. The issue was with some bathroom taps that had only been replaced by yourselves six months previously but were leaking. Your engineer, Alan, was excellent and there was no question of Homeserve not sorting it out. He replaced the faulty taps and so far everything has worked well.",HomeServe
Engineer was excellent went above and beyond to help with our issue.gave us further advice to contact relevant waterboard to resolve said issue. Many thanks. ,HomeServe
Phone call logging claim was dealt with efficiently and your plumber was very polite and re-assuring,HomeServe
"Whilst a leaking kitchen tap was replaced efficiently (issue 1) the plumber was unable to help with another potential water leak which was leading to a damp internal wall (issue 2). This second issue was in another room and not related to the leaking kitchen tap.Whilst accepting this damp area was identified within the wall by a moisture meter there was no obvious surface indication, without first removing the wallpaper. He mentioned Homeserve would not sanction investigation into a potential water pipe leak within the wall as wallpaper and wall plaster would need to be removed. The plumber investigated for external water ingress and used his camera to check for under floor leaks. The conclusion being any leak could only by water leaking from a water pipe within the plaster/brickwork.",HomeServe
I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give a higher grade as my tap is not fixed in firmly and moves.,HomeServe

"Andrew was very helpful. He explained what he was going to do re checking our drains. After his work, he explained what he had found very well. He made some helpful suggestions how to take things forward.",HomeServe
"I have 24 hour cover for leaking pipes. I had a leaking pipe at 2.30am in the morning and I called Homeserve.I liked that a plumber arrived within an hour and stopped the leak which appeared to be from a pump or a valve. He said that my contract did not cover pumps so he couldn't do any more although he said that it could be from a value or the pump, he did not check this. I subsequently called my normal plumber who advised there was no issue with the pump, a valve was leaking ie. Not the pump. I don't understand why the Homeserve plumber did not just replace the valve to see if that resolved the problem (which it did). I would like to know whether valves are covered by the contract (in which case you should reimburse me). In the meantime I will review whether to continue this contract going forwards - i am not sure it's worth it.",HomeServe
"Well it was confusing, because we had several visits before any real work was done and then it was abandoned because there was a change in how the broken drainage pipe was not to be repaired but a new ppipe was to be installed, so it took a few weeks before the job was completed,  ",HomeServe
Unfortunstely your engineer was unable to provide the part that was required for my dripping tap so I had to source it and order and pay for replacements. When the engineer returned he fitted the part but sadly the plastic on the tap was damaged so another engineer had to source new taps.  These were fitted but the hot tap turns to the left and the cold to the right. Is this correct? I haven't found this to be in any other bathroom.,HomeServe
Very experienced plumber excellent and professional. ,HomeServe
The engineer use 5-10 minutes to finish service. He did not check water tank pump etc. Then he stay outside my house for long time.,HomeServe

Engineer was very polite and helpful. Although he was unable to clear the blockage he tried very hard to do so. We agreed the only way to clear the blockage was to remove the bath panel. This was not possible without lifting the tiled floor or forcing the panel off which may well have damaged the panel.,HomeServe

"While I acknowledge that Homeserve sent three engineers over the course of a year, their efforts to resolve my toilet leak have been disappointing.Despite multiple visits, the leak persisted. The final engineer diagnosed the problem as requiring a complete cistern replacement, which Homeserve declined to perform. This has left me with an unresolved issue and a need to hire my own plumber.The fact that the cistern has been moved suggests that a previous engineer may have made changes without effectively addressing the leak. This has prolonged the problem and caused additional frustration.Homeserve's failure to resolve the issue has forced me to seek external help and incur additional expenses. As a result, I can only rate their service as two stars. While I appreciate the effort made by the engineers, the lack of a permanent solution and the disruption caused by multiple visits has marred my experience.",HomeServe
Engineer  was very prompt and sorted out my issue with our bath very quickly.   He was respectful to our home by putting covers on his shoes.  Excellent service.,HomeServe

"The plumber decided the problem was the stopcock, and did a temporary fix. There was still a leak form the meter the following day. Freeserve said it was Seven trent's responsibility and Severn Trent said it wasn't. So I had to get a local plumber to fix it.",HomeServe
"Manuel, the plumber who came to fix a leak in my toilet was super helpful and went above and beyond. He explained everything very clearly and was friendly.

I was relieved & very pleased with his work & help. ,HomeServe
Steve was able to identify and fix the job that the first plumber was not able to do.  Steve was very professional and kept his word when he promised to come back.

I wish he had come in the first instance then I would not have spend so much of my time waiting.,HomeServe
"the reason for my 5 stars is the gentleman that came to fix my outside drain was very kind and understanding, because when I phoned for a visit the lady on the call said 6.oopm that night the engineer would ring me back before he came so I had a few hours to kill and I was busy doing a job out my back gate while I was waiting but with in the hour he rang and I missed the call and lucky for me he knew I could not be far so he came looking for me I was so pleased he did when he said are you Ms Armstrong I said that was quick I thought I would have time to finish my job and get back in the house for my call as it happened he was in the area and rang me about 15mins after I went out and he had the good sense to come and find me anybody else would have reported back I was not in. thank you to the engineer.",HomeServe

Fast appointment date. Friendly plumber quick and efficient ,HomeServe
Your engineer replaced the parts and solved the cause of the leak but did not do anything to the leaking overflow even though he has replaced the ball valve so it should not now fill that high. He did not adjust the lever mechanism and so the toilet does not flush properly. It often takes several attempts to do its job.,HomeServe
Sufficient time alotted only  covered a basic jetting to clear the second blockage in 3months. There is obviously something wrong with the drain but I now have to wait for it to happen again and request a camery survey as well as clearing a blockage.,HomeServe
"Although your rep was a nice person, most of the things he said were about what he could not do rather than what he could do. Very negative. His parting offer was to create a hole in our hall wall to check if there was a pipe there causing the damp we called you out to try and resolve. As he said you would not make good where the suggested hole would be made I declined. It was obvious to even me there was no pipe in the location and the rep would not even offer an opinion on possible causes for the damp. Unfortunately I got so frustrated I made an abusive remark for which I later apologised.

When he left the leak was worse than before he came.  Had to call a plumber from another company to come and fix the problem, which cost a lot of money.  This is unacceptable from such a large corporation.  Never had any issues before.  She wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be renewing her contract next year.  Thank you very much Homeserve for sorting this situation.  My mum is extremely elated with the outcome and will continue using your services.  Changed from a one star to five star service.",HomeServe

Excellent service provided by homeserve plumber called Chris. Attended to a blocked downstairs toilet. Took his time to investigate the issue no rush. Removed the toilet Chris found the blockage in the back of the waste pipe. Also as the toilet did not have much suction power.

"Chap was chatty and speedily resolved the problem, which was the outside tap had snapped off leaving the screw part inside the fitting. There is no isolater for the outside tap, so the whole bungalow had to be cut off. My wife has a bowel condition, meaning many flushes are required. I had prepped two buckets of water, just in case. The actual job, removing the Ã¢â‚¬Å“trappedÃ¢â‚¬Â screw thread and fitting a new tap must have taken all of 5 or 6 minutes.Very happy with the result.",HomeServe

Most importantly we got a good service as the plumber ensured he checked everything relevant thoroughly to resolve the issue.

"I had to make two different appointments. The first one was a leaky pipe from the dishwasher.This took about 5  minutes to put right.  The next one was the manhole cover having to be lifted up to put the cover back on that the heavy rain had caused to fall off. Both engineers were very good, but I think jobs that only take 5minutes to put right are way too expensive for elderly people to have to pay.  Ã‚Â£60 per job  should be reduced when only taking  a few minutes to complete, when other people pay the same amount and the job takes hours to complete.  This should be looked into.",HomeServe
"Professional, knowledgeable and prompt. Quickly resolved and permanently fixed the leak, So reassuring to have this service.",HomeServe
Fabulous service. Helped my 92 year old dad and were also kind and courteous. Drains/toilet issue,HomeServe

Quite upsetting to discover water pooling below the cylinder which is stainless steel and only two yrs old.Home serve dispatched a plumber within the hour, and it was fixed within 2 hrs of our reporting it ! Full marks to Home Serve, especially as their man explained why it must have happened.",HomeServe
"An excellent plumber who stopped the leak, thus making good what had been badly fitted by the firm I had used in the first place.",HomeServe
Engineer was competent and helpful with advice but could not carry out the repair job we required -replacing a radiator valve  - as should the system require to be drained he could not guarantee that it would refill and we would have to sign a declaration to that effect. ,HomeServe
"Prompt service by a plumber who sorted out a frozen pipe for me a couple of years or so ago.  Once again he did an excellent job - clean, tidy & efficient, also a pleasant and friendly approach. Couldn't ask for more",HomeServe
The plumber was on time and was very helpful. Spot on.,HomeServe
I liked that there was a quick response to the water leak in my loft. The engineer arrived very quickly coming from quite a distance. He said he would put in a report to HomeServe. However after nearly three weeks I had heard nothing and phoned for an update. I was told I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered as the leak was from the hot water tank and not the pipe.  Hmmm.I was really disappointed that no one had phoned to tell me this. They said I had to use my house insurance . (They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover plumbing )and I thought I was covered for  an event like this by HomeServe. The whole disaster cost me thousands of pounds as I had to get a new outside boiler and have a cupboard taken apart and relined to accommodate the new pipes. I am now considering actually if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worthwhile continuing with HomeServe and instead look for a more inclusive policy overall. ,HomeServe
Homeserve plumber used leak detection hydrogen gas to cleverly trace and repair water supply leak with first deep hole dug! Large front garden so very impressive.,HomeServe
Guy came and spent at most 20 mins here. He said our toilet might be blocked. He then mentioned he would try clearing with a plunger but then didnt try to clear obstruction. He then said might be an issue with pipe and suggested we try to use toilet more often!!  The toilet has now cleared itself so obviously was a partial blockage. Not sure why homeserve guy didnt attempt to clear himself!!  Am going to message Homeserve asking for refund of the Ã‚Â£30 excess ,HomeServe
All the  operatives were helpful and worked hard to find my leak. They persisted even though the task proved difficult and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m grateful to them all.,HomeServe
Easy to contact on the phone and book an appointment. Plumber turned up on time and was so helpful sorting my problem.,HomeServe
"The plumber arrived and immediately stated that he only had a max of 45 mins before he needed to leave, and wouldn't be able to do anything in that time and we had to keep the water turned off.  He wouldn't listen to any info on how the water pipes work in the property and didn't even try to find the source of the leak.  He threatened to have to dig up my floor before departing for the evening.During the evening I was able to work out that it was the hot water pipe leaking, so we could at least have cold water available - surely this is something the plumber should have ascertained?He was in a slightly better mood when he returned the following day, but didn't check which pipe was leaking and ended up cutting the wrong one first.  He did eventually fix the problem, and without having to impact the floor.",HomeServe

After removing patio slabs and digging down sufficiently deep enough, so as not to compromise the wall and pond, he repaired the faulty pipework and replaced the patio slabs, leaving no trace that any work had been carried out.",HomeServe

"The job on the faulty toilet flushing assembly was completed OK.However, the flush is too short (old type cistern with flushing handle) so can only give 3 stars.",HomeServe
We have paided full wack .and tried to make a claim for a leaking down pipe and you wouldn't fix it.even though pipes have been there since we moved in.its not right. Thank you for your reply but the soil pipe has been like that since we moved in 9 yrs ago.perhaps you would like to come around and check everything else in our house to make sure it's OK to fix in future because we don't want to pay for something if your gonna find faults in our house.,HomeServe

The plumber was very friendly and found the situation very quickly. Very professional.,HomeServe
"The plumbing engineer provided an excellent service on the day and fixed the problem quickly. However your call centre is company based and not customer orientated. This is because they cannot give  any idea when an engineer will arrive. We had an 8-6pm appointment, and whilst the engineer arrived within this time at around 4.30pm, we had to arrange for someone to wait at the property all day so as not to miss the engineer.  I did call the customer service centre several times just to be told that an engineer would be at the property before 6pm and had a few other jobs first.  If you know that the engineer has other jobs first then you should be able to give a better idea of arranging a suitable time, or at least give regular live update similar to other service providers. ",HomeServe
"Poor Company very poor customer  service , had a blocked drain the first time they did not turn up, the 2nd time they phoned and said they could not make it, so twice let down, then somebody came said it was an easy fix, then somebody else came out and said there was a problem but said everything was fine on his report ,then they sent a contractor who said it will be done but now i get  a call from HomeServe saying they can not do it as the drain is not covered , so seen 4 people and now they decide they don`t want to do it so now taken advice against them, stay away a very poor company and the customer service is a joke kept us waiting months then decide they do not want the job",HomeServe

"Had a leaking shower so called Homeserve thinking they'd resolve it. The chap they sent round seemed thorough, and claimed the leak was through the grouting/sealant which was not covered by Homeserve. Fair enough, we called a tiler round to regrout and reseal the entire shower, which cost Ã‚Â£250. The shower still leaked. We called a local plumber round who found that the waste pipe connection was slightly loose, and resolved it in around 2 minutes. No more leak.So by using HomeServe we wasted Ã‚Â£30 on the call out (which should have discovered and resolved the leak), and Ã‚Â£250 on unnecessary tiling work. Thanks for nothing, HomeServe. Needless to say we'll not be renewing, and I highly recommend finding a reliable local plumber instead. ",HomeServe
"The original person who checked the system and gave the review,did not come, but he said a new pipe would be done as the old one was very old.  Two new service engineers came who were not sure of the cause, after checking below the concrete drive they found the leak. Seems to be ok at present. Will keep an eye on it as they said if it goes wrong it would take two days to replace the old pipe.",HomeServe
The two engineers that came out went the extra mile to help resolve a blocked toilet by replacing and fitting the whole unit with a new one ,HomeServe
Not very pleased with the first call out never resolved the problem had to ring again the next plumber was very good and so far as resolved the problem ,HomeServe
Good service.  Reported leaking pipe at 8.00 am and advised water had bÃƒÂ¨n turned off by internal stopcock. Engineer arrived by 6.00 pm that evening as planned and repaired leak.,HomeServe
I have had a brilliant service provided to me..From booking to fixing the  problem .The engineer was very efficient and skilled.He worked hard to unblock my drainage ,HomeServe
Great service. Quick polite and professional. I had a leaky water pipe under the sink. It was fixed and done within 30 mins. ,HomeServe
"While the first engineer was unable to fix my faulty toilet, Homeserve were very helpful and quickly arranged another engineer to attend. He took his time to ensure it was fixed with care and has done a great job. ",HomeServe

"Quick and efficient! Most of my cistern's innards replaced, now it works perfectly.12",HomeServe
"Very polite and knowledgable engineer/plumber. No waffle just sensible advice and a way forward that absolutely met all our needs. Perfect service, quick, quiet and effective. Highly recommended ",HomeServe
"We had a problem with a leaking pipe in our kitchen.  The engineer came and sorted it for us, it was a hidden leak, so had no idea where it was coming from, but he got to work, found the leak and fixed it.  Very nice engineer, well mannered, courteous and competent!",HomeServe
"Plumber arrived and dealt with the emergency within an hour.Would have given 5 stars but service let itself down when I answered having a health problem when it switched from "" automatic"" and call put in queue. I hung up after 10 minutes as needed phone line clear for  call from engineer which automatic system told me to expect.",HomeServe
"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d had a leak in my bedroom from my en-suite loo, which soaked the carpet and some of my furniture The insurance company was absolutely useless (complete bandits) but Paul from Homeserve came and sorted out the leak and fixed the pipes.",HomeServe
The person who attended offered good advice and the blockage issue was resolved in a very short time.,HomeServe
"Quick and efficient service, all sorted. The plumber was polite and pleasant, as your people usually are. Many thanks",HomeServe
"Outstanding service. What appeared to me to be potentially a massive problem was handled by Homeserve speedily, and with little fuss. The leak location was quickly identified and repaired with no impact on the kitchen or surrounding area. Very satisfied with the whole Homeserve team.",HomeServe
"Plumber called same day,friendly,helpful and fixed the problem . An excellent service. ",HomeServe
Incredibly professional and polite team member came to help with a drip behind our toilet which resulted in him needing to take the toilet out and refit it. All with a smile and keeping us notified as he worked. On a Sunday too!!  Definitely would recommend HomeServe. In fact we already do to fam and friends :),HomeServe
"The plumber came to the house as agreed on time. He was polite, professional and efficient. He explained what work was needed, carried it out, and tidied up afterwards. I'm impressed with his service. Thank you.",HomeServe
"Plummer phoned to let me know he was coming, came on time and did a very good repair job, no mess or hassle excellent!!",HomeServe
Plumber called with arrival time explained what was needed completed job quickly & successfully no mess no disruption ,HomeServe
Engineer arrived on time after calling to say he was on his way. Then repaired leak and explained how it happened.Also pointed out that stopcock was seized and should be reported and hopefully replace.Thanks to engineer and customer services for rapid action see,HomeServe
Great service from Homeserve called at 11.50 plumber (Martin) arrived at 5.30pm did a great job and cleaned up after himself.,HomeServe
"My recent experience with Homeserve plumbing was excellent.The engineer rang ahead of his visit, and was friendly and efficient.He quickly identified the problem, and solved it with a modified flush system on the bathroom toilet, switching it from the old style handle to a more modern push-button.Excellent service.",HomeServe
As for the first guy who looked at the issue we weren't impressed especially as it turns out he ordered the wrong tank and didn't order the fittings which made it extremely difficult for the lads that turned up and bless them they went out of the way to fix the problem to which we cannot praise enough ,HomeServe
Problem leak has not been resolved.,HomeServe
"Dripping tap rectified, job booked in for next day and completed.Thank you for speedy response.",HomeServe
Amazing... arrived promptly ... Knowledgeable and cleared blockage. Fabulous service,HomeServe
"Homeserve were really helpful and quick, we had a plumber out within 1 hour of calling. He was a really great guy called Den who was very helpful and friendly when it came to sorting our problem with our sewage pipe.",HomeServe
Liked: plumber excellent & did a good job.Disliked: needed a replacement kitchen tap. Homeserve offer only standard cheap replacement tap that does not match with the kitchen. This is an insurance policy so they should offer like for like replacement. We had to buy a tap on Amazon & the plumber returned to fit it. Booked an online appointment which we thought was recorded but had to make appointment by phone. Make sure you get a confirmation of the online booked appointment as the system does work! Price raises once you are in contract are usually high.,HomeServe
"Excellent service as always from this company ,prompt efficient and cleared the blockage swiftly so full arks to the engineer who attended. ",HomeServe
"Quick, efficient service. Neil the plumber knew what he was talking about!!!Very experienced and fixed the problems ",HomeServe
Plumber arrived on the day I called to fix leaking pipe which was very awkward to access. Best service IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had from a company since pre-covid!,HomeServe
"The plumber who arrived to see if he could find the water leak which has been going on for a long time now, finally thinks he has found it. It appeared to be in my loft tank where he replaced the float valve. It was an extremely hot day and the poor man was in my very small loft for quite a while. He was very polite, refused a cold drink and even wrote down what he had done so I could let Affinity Water know. I am very grateful to him and Home Serve.",HomeServe
Very efficient visit in checking the drainage.,HomeServe
Arrived on time checked pipe work thoroughly causing no inconvenience ,HomeServe
The person who came in the morning was for drainage not replacing a tube above ground but he did arrange for someone to come in the afternoon who carried out the repair ,HomeServe
I was really pleased with your service and would have given 5 stars if you could've repaired the leak a bit sooner BUT I do realise there's other people needing leaks fixing. ,HomeServe
Sorted the drain really friendly lovely man thank you ,HomeServe
We have water in our living room where our stop tap and electric are they said we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a leek . So they sent another guy out to check still canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming fromÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ ,HomeServe
Everything was dealt with professionally. The man who came to sort my drain looked at the job on the Monday and as he didn't have the part he needed rearranged for the Wednesday. He came back as arranged and did a really good and tidy job. He was lovely to deal with and I was really happy with the job he did. One happy customer Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬ ,HomeServe
Very friendly drains expert sorted the problem and was happy to explain which pipes lead where.,HomeServe
"Following 2 unsuccessful repairs to a leaking toilet by HomeServe plumbers the 3rd plumber successfully completed the repair with no issues, He was very professional explained the problem that was causing the leak and carried out the repair. He was friendly and efficient and completed a good job ",HomeServe
Very swift service and helpful plumber ,HomeServe
"They came out so very quickly, in fact it was within hours of the phone call. The leak was found in minutes and repaired without any trouble. They even replanted the little plant they had to dig up. We can not praise them enough. ",HomeServe
"Easy to book an engineer but still cost me 30 pounds excess. The guy was friendly and knowledgable but couldn't identify the root of the problem still. In conclusion I was told just to monitor the water leak problem to see if it gets worse. If someone needs to come back out again, I hope it's not another 30 pounds....",HomeServe
It was quite easy to book an appointment for my blocked drain. The person who visited was very friendly and responsive to my queries. He was very quick in solving the issue.,HomeServe
"Easy to make appointment, friendly engineers, work carried out well.  Would be five stars but I have to arrange and cover costs for cosmetic repairs and plastering resulting from the plumbing repair. I had hoped the insurance would cover restoration to condition before the leak",HomeServe
I was very impressed by the promptness of receiving an appointment and very pleased with the actual replacement mixer tap.  So no more dripping taps. Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢ ,HomeServe
"The engineer found a leak, took loads of photos and said he would report it and someone would be in touch.  Nothing happened and when I checked via Live Chat I got a load of unhelpful obviously scripted responses to my questions.  I have now made a claim and fully expect an engineer to turn up with absolutely no knowledge of the previous engineer's visit and no access to any photos!",HomeServe
Dislike the fact that you cancelled the appointment at the last minute three times. A total disregard to your customer. I liked the fact that your agents were very professional and detected the water leak problem which was the responsibility of the Water Company. They liaised with SWW to have them come out and fix the problem.,HomeServe
"Plumber arrived on time as arranged Poor man thought heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d got a nice easy job at the end of the day but it turned out to be a painHe explained all the options to me that he could do to fix the toilet Ã°Å¸Å¡Â½None were really ideal , but basically that was the fault of the installerI feel he did the best he could  I have a neat and tidy job and the loo works Ã°Å¸Â¤Â·Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â‚¬Ã¯Â¸Â",HomeServe
Homeserve is the cheapest option for plumbing issues.,HomeServe
"Appalling service. Yet again, you send an engineer who has either no ability or no intention of fixing the problem. He made no attempt to fix the leak on the pipes connecting the cistern. Instead, he told me to get a plumber to replace the entire toilet. I called a plumber who said there's nothing wrong with the toilet and has ordered the correct part to solve the problem. You should be refunding the excess I paid. Worst company ever.YOUR engineer might have written up about a leak from the pan. It's wall mounted and my plumber confirmed there is no leak from there. More a case of couldn't be bothered. ",HomeServe
"Our leaking garden tap was not considered an emergency. As a result our first 2 appointments were cancelled at the last minute which was most frustrating and costly due to water loss, there was no delay in taking my Ã‚Â£30 excess!! 3rd time lucky , an engineer turned up on time and the problem was quickly resolved. I will be cancelling my direct debit.",HomeServe
"We had a leaking cistern that we couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get at.  I phoned, made an appointment, chappie came and fixed it.  Job done, no fuss and bother and no charge.Excellent service all round.  Been with Homeserve for years and will stay with them.",HomeServe
"I had issues with kitchen mixer tap dripping and bath tap was seized up, so I rang to see if an plumber could call. Received a txt message to confirm the appointment.  I didn't have long to wait, he arrived on time - replaced my kitchen tap and sorted both bath taps out for me.  The work was all completed within 30 minutes, very pleasant person - pleased with the service.",HomeServe
MudRepairing a deep underground water leak is not an easy job but it went well in the mud and had a builders initial clean and new tarmacThey didn't send the outside gang straightaway so we had to wait extra 3 days but thankfully not on water meter,HomeServe
Friendliness off plumber he was very helpful and sis his job suburb  The only thing that needs improving is time slots as at the moment they are too long. I think people need to be informed the morning of their visit if its going to be morning or afternoon ,HomeServe
The person who came was very very good he can come any time and do my plumbing thank you,HomeServe
Excellent- the problem has been solved by the second man who came out.  Unfortunately I have only given you four stars as the first man that came out stated it was fixed which it clearly  was not. As a pensioner I begrudge the fact that I have had to pay sixty pounds for two visits when it would have been much better for the second man to come out initially thus saving me thirty pounds.,HomeServe
The plumber arrived on the day we reported two faults which I thought excellent. He diagnosed and mostly fixed both. ,HomeServe
Great comfort to know there is a plumber that will come to sort out even the smallest of issues. The engineer was really  helpful and knowledgeable. ,HomeServe
Original engineer was unable to deal with plumbing based issues. He  was only able to conform what I had already reported and then arrange for someone else to come another day.When the right engineer came he did a good job.,HomeServe
quick call out time. Tested the drains and all clear now.,HomeServe
"We had a big problem when the pipe went and the engineer was great, not only did he repair the main pipe but he also noticed that another valve feeding the upstairs was leaking slightly and fixed that too.",HomeServe
You were brilliant unblocked my drain in no time thank you,HomeServe
I booked a call out with Homeserve being very clear regarding the plumbing problem. I waited two days for the appointment. The engineer called on the day to check the details and explained we the policy did not cover this issue. The appointment was then cancelled. I suggest the call centre staff are properly trained in all aspects of policy cover to ensure customers aren't mislead and appointments wrongly arranged. ,HomeServe
"The service was very good, the plumber did a great job",HomeServe
We had a burst water pipe in the kitchen. Homeserve were extremely helpful both on the phone and with their rapid response. Their plumber was very polite and helpful and did an excellent job. ,HomeServe
Professional approach by plumber and ease of booking,HomeServe
Still water leaking not happy I am paying membership plus I paid Ã‚Â£30 acces fee Too expensive ,HomeServe
"Sadly for HomeServe this is the third time I have called them out in the past years despite hardly having to over the previous year, My appointment was cancelled twice by HomeServe on this occasion but when the Plumber did visit he did a great job with very little mess too. HomeServe plumbers are clean and tidy workers which being rather house proud I do appreciate. ",HomeServe
"Plumber was friendly and efficient, however booking was less so, automated system could not recognise my problem and i was expected to wait 4 days. The real person was much better and changed appointment to a 2 day wait",HomeServe
Easy to book and came next day. Great plumber sorting a long-standing problem others had not been able to fix,HomeServe
I had a blocked sewage pipe .A Homeserve plumber came within 24 hours and fixed the problem within one hour of arrival . The problem was a large ball of fat in the pipe .Problem fixed with no fuss.,HomeServe
Blocked drain causing flooding at side of the house.After 2 visits the stubborn blockage was cleared.Prompt response and job well done.,HomeServe
"Engineer was not that friendly, he changed a leaky tap on a cloakroom sink, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t switch off the stopcock so water all over the floor, the tap size was not like for like as he said he was going to fit, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more for a kitchen sink so way over sized for a small sink. He also didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t connect the hot pipe back so could only get cold water, fortunately my grandson knew how to reconnect. Would not recommend.",HomeServe
The plumber explained what he was going to do clearly and tidied up after himself. My only complaint is that I reported the fault on a Thursday afternoon and no one was available to come out until Sunday evening. This meant I was without a functioning toilet for 3 days and there is only one bathroom in the house!,HomeServe
"The engineer was polite and professional. But i feel mislead about the service; I have a plumbing problem in my house, which manifests in more than one place. It is being treated as multiple problems, with separate call outs and charges, and this way we aren't going to get to the root, we will only ever be superficial fixes to the individual symptoms.",HomeServe
We had a blocked sink . Person came and cleared blokage. Very tidy work no mess.,HomeServe
The engineers for plumbing and  pest control  were fantastic  and polite  eg Ollie the plumbing  engineer  who visited  on 7th  August ,HomeServe
Super easy to book appointment online for water leak in bathroom. Professional polite and friendly tradesperson who did a great job. Would highly recommended. ,HomeServe
My thought is home serve plumbing and drainage insurance is a corn because i had a leak in the bathroom but the service man told me that cant fix it because they think its mot a pipe problem having said that please educate me what does the insurance cover then ?????? I still have to folk out more money for a plumber to fix the problem for sure I will be cancelling the insurance what a waste  of money it has been for me Ps the service man was great ! ,HomeServe

"It was only a leaking (not dripping) tap and we did not expect to have it repaired as quickly, (or on a Sunday).

"great speedy service, experienced craftsmen. clear in explaining what they are doing and why.

No fees for 2nd visit and both plumbers were were good.",HomeServe
Home Serve are quick to attend to a problem and solved my problem efficiently.  However there was a difficulty with the automative voice and it had misheard my problem and initially sent drainage rather than a plumber,HomeServe

"When the soil pipe servicing an upstairs W.C. collapsed, replacement was complicated when the pipe was discovered to be made out of asbestos. I was fortunate to have kept up our ""Plumbing an drainage plus"" policy as I was fully covered. Homeserve initially sent out a plumber to survey and then organised scaffolding and a specialist asbestos removal company before their plumbers were able to install a plastic replacement. Communication with Homeserve was extremely good, they made the arrangements with all parties and kept me informed throughout.",HomeServe
Had a water leak early on a Sunday evening.  Got through OK kn the telephone and was given instructions what to do to make us safe till the Monday.  Told to expect a call back on Monday between 7-11am.  Waited till well after that and had to chase them up.    We'd had no running water at all during that time so could not flush the toilet.   Luckily we'd stocked up with fresh drinking water.   When I got through on the phone they obviously could see we had been forgotten about so went to great lengths to get someone out to us very quickly.  The plumber arrived nice and sorted the job out efficiently.  Great bloke. Friendly and cheerful.  ,HomeServe

It seems my outside waste water down pipe is not covered by Homeserve. The plumber still came out even though I had explained the situation over the phone. ,HomeServe
Dave and Martin were very professional and did a great job with the leak detector. Left the are where the leaks were under the floorboards in the hall just as they were before they took them up. ,HomeServe
"On my first call the response was very quick paid my excess and booked the call out to clear outside drain straight away and when it was convenient to myself, Call out was on time and let me know first what time he was calling , job gone drain cleared and no problems since .Just hope my premiums dont raise to much on renewal!

"Reported a drainage problem but Hannah your automated service booked a plumber.

Both of your staff were very helpful and efficient.",HomeServe
The engineer hopefully sorted my problem think we found the root cause of my leak .and fixed the problem ,HomeServe
Very unsatisfied with the way the man dealt with my job. I still continue to have a problem with a leak under my sink making my floor wet. I paid Ã‚Â£30 for a 15 minute visit and when I told him I had a leaking tap on my bath and could he look at it he told me no. I would have to pay another Ã‚Â£30 for a new appointment. I will be cancelling my account as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not satisfied that my problem was investigated fully. ,HomeServe
Engineer replaced parts to toilet and sink and they are usable now.,HomeServe

When the plumber 1st arrived he had a problem turning off the water at the meter. He rang the water authority who said they would contact me later. They didn't. Homeserve rang me the following day and gave me more advise. It took the water authority over a week to sort the problem on a Monday. Homeserve rang me on the Tuesday and sent the plumber out on the Wednesday. He sorted all 3 jobs out in about 2.5 hours and even though he had to drain a radiator there was no mess.Homeserve were very helpful and supportive through out.,HomeServe
Prompt service and reliable call out left me with a functioning loo,HomeServe
"I had two visits last week, one for a frozen stop tap and the other for a faulty flushing toilet. In both cases your engineers were kind courteous and very professional.",HomeServe

I was really pleased with the whole experience The availability for getting a plumber and the speed of him finding the replacement part we needed and then fitting it.,HomeServe
"The response to an ""emergency"" was disappointing. Initially I was offered an appointment 7 days ahead for a water leak and only after pressing was it agreed that within 48 hours was more appropriate. On the morning of the agreed appointment I had a text message to say that it would be the following day!No issue with the job/fix being done but not impressed with the organisation/reliability of booking the repair. The service is only needed for emergencies and the response rate was not great.",HomeServe
Very helpful Plummer. Listened to us. Thoroughly checked for leak and fixed the leak quickly and efficiently. Very pleased with the job done. ,HomeServe

We had a problem with an overflowing sewage manhole cover. The technician managed to clear the blockage and clean everything up in about 30 minutes. Highly satisfactory result!,HomeServe
Customer service- computer says no attitude. You can tell they are used to complaints. It took 3 visits.Guy 1 did not turn up for AM visit till late afternoon. No call to inform customer. Was in a hurry and couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do the job. Said I had to purchase my own tap as the one he had wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t compatible. 2nd guy connected hot and cold the wrong way and the pop up lever was sticking out like a sore thumb incorrectly installed. Went off with my old tap. I asked him to return it. No show ! 3rd guy was ace! Did a good job. ,HomeServe
Always quick to respond and a good service. Always had a friendly engineer or plumber too. Unfortunately the cost per month is now a lot higher than initially expected.,HomeServe

"The engineer was lovely, but I felt ripped off by the call centre. I had a leak to the main water pipe which feeds into the water softener. All explained to Call handler, they sent engineer, Engineer tells me that anything to do with water softener is excluded. So I paid the Ã‚Â£30 call out fee for absolutley nothing, call centre should have told me softener was excluded rather than take the Ã‚Â£30 and let me find out in person.",HomeServe

Another call out we asked that the taps be checked and it was found that they were worn out and water was leaking from the bottom of the tap. This was repaired and left working in good working order.I am still unsure whether all pipework under the sink is leak free though, ",HomeServe
"I was contacted last week by Anglia water informing me  my smart meter was indicating a leak. 4 lires per hour constantly. An engineer arrived from Anglian and confirmed the leak was underground between my meter and the house. I phoned Homeserve yesterday at 11.30 and at 14.00 the same day their engineer Darren Rutter arrived to investigate. The equipment Homeserve carry on their vans was really impressive ,particularly the inert gas that screws into the meter housing which enabled Darren to pinpoint the problem. This necessitated cutting into an area of concrete path to the rear of my house. He was then able to identify the cause which was a right angled elbow fitting which he swiftly rectified ,then demonstrated via my smart meter that all flow had now ceased. I rechecked this morning and no flow was evident. This was truly exceptional customer service indeed , also Darren was a pleasure to meet and clearly knows what he is doing ,very freindly and helpful . He made good the concrete path ,and left the site spotlessly clean , the only evidence he had been there was the fresh concrete,",HomeServe
The plumber/engineer was very experienced. He knew what the problem was and went to collect the spare parts and fixed the problem there and then.,HomeServe

The day was the hottest day of the year here in Cambridge 34.8 degrees and l felt so sorry for him having to work in the horrendous heat but he just kept going!! I have always had good service from Homesearve and would recommend them to everyone.",HomeServe

"We discovered a severe water leak from the end of our drive where it meets the pavement, I called Thames water who came out quite quickly, and dug a hole and told me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on my property and because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got Homeserve cover I should call them, so they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix the problem, Homeserve, were brilliant on the phone very professional and ensured they had all the correct details, Jason turned up the next morning and after a chat he got straight to work lifting the block paving very carefully and within the hour he was showing me the burst pipe, he fixed the problem and refitted the paving, and I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even see where he took it up ! To say IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m impressed is an understatement, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recommend this company enough, I did have them out a few years before with a blocked sewer that I really donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to go into that, apart from saying they sorted it out with the same amount of professionalism Very impressed and the best yearly payment you can make, Thank you Jason, and Charlie for being top men ",HomeServe

Contacted late in the day and offered visit the following afternoon. Service man rang 15 minutes prior to visit. Drain blockage cleared quickly and efficiently. ,HomeServe
"The team was exceptional from start to finish, we were experiencing a drainage problem but the HomeServe team made it their priority to resolve it, after 4 long visits to our property, they had the breakthrough and cleared the problem.I would highly recommend HomeServe to any potential new customer reading this review.We will definitely be renewing our policy with them for the following year.A*****",HomeServe
"Great handling. Quick response. Plumber arrived within 2 hours at 6.30 pm. Job fixed. So pleased to resolve a leaking toilet. Friendly, helpful and efficient.",HomeServe
appointment made quickly plumber very quick and informative,HomeServe
"Your plumber arrived on time and was most efficient, spending time to check the problem area and all fixtures in the property.    He was very pleasant, informative and professional.   Thank You.",HomeServe
The service couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been better. I rang to report the problem in the morning and the problem was sorted just after lunch. I even got a phone call from the plumber telling me he was on his way,HomeServe
Well your guy found that my header tank had blocked so he released the blockage thanks for that. He then went on to explain that the header tank inlet valve was on and it should be off so he turned it off saying this would stop further trouble. He also said that my plumber should not have left it open. So i phoned my plumber to complain and he immediately said your guys talking rubbish and if i turn off the inlet valve and the rad waters drop over time i would burn out my pump. He then came to look and said the main problem was not only the blockage but the ball valve was not working. He has replaced the ball valve and reopened the inlet valve. So in all your guy left me in a situation that could have cost me a lot of money this is not good and not what I expect for Ã‚Â£350 plus policy. In future could you make sure i get a qualified plumber has my own plumber says your guy is very very wrong and would say so to his face. All in all not very happy,HomeServe
The plumber arrived at the specified time. He was polite and friendly and explained the  problem. After he had solved the problem he explained how to avoid it in the future. ,HomeServe
The gentleman that came and repaired our toilet replaced the flush system he was very professional. He arrived at the time he said he would . It was late in the evening but we were very pleased to have the toilet back working properly. ,HomeServe
"Homeserve are fantastic to deal with.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had to use them twice over the past 3 years for on premise mains leak & roots blocking drains - neither of which would I have the skills or equipment to resolve.  Both times IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been working away - they arrive eeal with, come back when they say.  This is a service & policy that really works for me.",HomeServe
I was concerned on the phone as i had said blocked drain repeated back what i had said then at end of call all booked in for your blocked pipe which i couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do anything The man that came out was really good thank you To improve please employ people not robots ,HomeServe
On this occasion I had a very friendly and knowledgeable engineer who sorted out my problem. The previous visit in May was not such  a success as the problem was misdiagnosed and we  have had to put up with a blocked drain for 3 months. ,HomeServe
"Phoned in the morning,plumber arrived 1.30.Great service,no mess",HomeServe
The plumber couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find anything wrongAnd I paid Ã‚Â£30 call out fee,HomeServe

Easy to access emergency help when I needed it. Call handler was very patient and professional. Needed to have new shower installed. Electrician and plumber both polite and friendly. The shower they fitted developed a fault within 3 weeks. Homeserve was contacted and came next day. Second new shower fitted today. Very good service. ,HomeServe
"Quick response, Plummer was efficient, very pleasant and helpful ",HomeServe
Came out same day to look at problemFound a leak next day very quickly which we hope is the problem solved!,HomeServe
"I have always been impressed with homeserve until today (Thursday 15 August 2024)I was due a visit between 8am and 1pm to fix a faulty valve so I could have my washing machine installed on Saturday 17August. I had not hear anything so at 12.40 I rang homeserve to ask what was happening. They confirmed that the appointment was booked but the engineer was running a little late but would definitely be coming. At 1.20 I received a call from the main office to say the appointment had been cancelled and rescheduled for Monday 20 August. I explained that that was not good enough as my washing machine could not be installed on Saturday, lo and behold she then offered me Friday18August in the afternoon. I have now had to cancel things arranged for Friday afternoon to suit homeserve. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!",HomeServe
Engineer was round within two days of my call and helped put my mind at ease about a constant drip from my kitchen sink. We didn't need any further investigation at this time.,HomeServe
Purchasing plumbing cover was clearly explained and easy to organise,HomeServe
"You came out straight away, sorted banking pipes pipes and leaking taps in no time at all. Thankyou",HomeServe
Good service but the taps still drip and difficult to turn off.,HomeServe
When I had a plumbing problem it got sorted out and done professionally so now I've decided to take out electrical  cover with yourselves but haven't had to call you out for anything electrical yet,HomeServe
"Engineer polite and friendly, found the problem. Unfortunately for me need new shower .",HomeServe
Amazing service. I phoned in  the morning they gave me a time slot. The engineer notified me he was on his way early afternoon. Soon fixed my leak,HomeServe
"Good communication.Worked quickly and efficiently, even though it needed ""sludge"" dealing with.Left the room as he found it",HomeServe
I had a serious leak on the supply pipe. The engineer came quickly but needed a part to fix it which he was unable to get as it was too late on the Friday evening. He apparently slowed the leak. 3 days later another engineer came who advised that the diagnosis of the cause had been wrong and a different part was needed which he obtained and fixed the leak,HomeServe
Very informative. The plumber was very clean and tidy with the job.Only negative is the plumber didn't have the right parts for the replacement. He had to go and get it from nearest hardware shop. ,HomeServe
The plumber was very experienced and a very friendly and did a very good job with our water leak.  ,HomeServe
Good deal on taking out Plumbing and Drainage policy online. Quick and easy transaction.,HomeServe
"I would have given 5* review if they did not turn up twice on the trot.  The service when the plumbers turned up for an underground leak were excellent I cannot fault their work.  I had to have 2 visits Charlie worked really hard to find the leak and found one leak near the water meter, and tried very hard to find the second leak but time ran out but he managed to find the area of where the second leak was coming from.  The second visit was from Josh and Jason who also did a stellar job in locating the leak under the kitchen floor.  They cleaned up after themselves after having dug up part of my kitchen floor and left the floor in a good condition where I only had to replace a few tiles.  I would happily recommend these gentlemen their work ethic was amazing.",HomeServe
The plumber was on time and cleared the problem quickly. The rating would have been higher but I did not appreciate being charged three times for a single visit,HomeServe
"We was extremely disappointed with the service we received from HomeServe. We were meant to have someone come to fix our shower between the hours of (12pm-6pm). Nobody arrived within that time frame. We werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t updated at all and had to call them a few times and they continued to say that someone was coming, but there was no apology for the inconvenience. A person arrived past 7pm and they told us that the shower wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered under our policy and could try to look into getting it repaired elsewhere which may take up to 2 weeks. A person in the household is in the vulnerable category and this has caused additional stress which is very distressing. We are now left with no way to shower in the meantime. ",HomeServe
"I have been paying Ã‚Â£275 a year  for the last umpteen years, and have only called you out twice. The first time  the man Power washed all the drains inside and out, and did a great job.  This time the young man came in with a giant plunger  stayed for 5 minutes then went.  I will not be renewing my contract with you once it runs out in December.  I could have done that myself. Disgusted with your services.",HomeServe
It was a great relief having a policy with Homeserve. The fault wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy to find but they went through a process of elimination. They sorted everything out even with the water board.There was only one out of four who called at the house who wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pleasant. He actually made me feel very uncomfortable with his attitude.Customer service advisers were amazing too.,HomeServe
Blocked DrainSwift response to call out request and drain problem diagnosed but still waiting for repairs to be carried out.,HomeServe
"Firstly they cancelled my appt last min after waiting in for them and changing my plans to accommodate their visit, ok, no problem, rebooked for the next day , the plumber arrived , no plumbers tools or bag, I showed him the issue , which is loo drops when I run the bath or loo flushed, he says my loo overflow is linked to the bath and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the issue, I tell him but the loo is dripping from  the screw and washer under the loo, He says yeah I saw that , I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix it ,then he leaves and spends the next 20 mins out the front parked sitting in his van puffing away on his e cig, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m furious! The service has really gone down, typical of ppl nowadays , no one seems to wanna do their job anymore , I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be renewing my policy with Homeserve ! ",HomeServe
"I needed my leaking douche fixed, paid the necessary Ã‚Â£30 & booked a plumber to come in.Also needed a leak under the bathtub fixed, which was seeping through the floor onto the ceiling below hence booked that too for the same day & paid another Ã‚Â£30.On the day, plumber arrived, saw both the jobs that were in the same bathroom upstairs & told me straight up that he wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch either because Homeserve doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover for these types of leaks & left. Question is why on earth was I charged for 2 jobs ie. Ã‚Â£60 when both jobs were described in detail over the phone, one being a douche leak & the 2nd was a leak under the bathtub when they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered ?? The plumber did not even open the side of my bathtub to check. I called Homeserve to say that I had taken the day off for these jobs, they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done & IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve paid Ã‚Â£60, the plumber that came said he could fix the drip in my septic tank but I would have to call & book again for that.  One would assume that they would reimburse me for one job because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearly the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fault & fix my septic tank as the other job. No! They charged me another Ã‚Â£30 saying the previous jobs have to be looked into. Plumber came the same day & changed a small washer in the toilet tank & left. As a customer IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m down Ã‚Â£90 & I got a small rubber washer for it. I pay Ã‚Â£17/month for this kind of service Have paid for several years now & this was my 1st call to them for service. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been 8 weeks since, I am still trying to get my money back from them. Homeserve has really let me down & I shall be cancelling my d/d now. Therefore please look elsewhere & save yourself the hassle, headache & your money!! ",HomeServe
"very smooth service, the plumber did a great job fixing my leaky tap, and got a new tap as the old one was not reparable. swift and stress free experience",HomeServe

"I had an appointment on the day of reporting the leak from the radiator. Taylor the engineer was brilliant, found the issue and explained what he needed to do. He was very professional and polite and tidy. ",HomeServe
I had a plumbing emergency with water pouring out and flooding my bathroom and spreading into the hallway. Although I managed to get through to someone to speak to fairly quickly it was a long time taking details and paying excess before I was put through to someone to make an emergency appointment.  Then the line went dead and I had to do it all again!Eventually an appointment was made for the same day within a 5 hour timeline (which would be actually 7 hours following the call).  This was not good as I had water pouring out of my toilet sistern and I am unable to get down to turn stop taps off or anything else.  Very stressful.  Eventually a plumber came at 12 noon and was able to fix everything for me.  To leave an elderly lady with an emergency like that for that number of hours was horrendous.  I live in a close of elderly people but fortunately one of my neighbours eventually managed to turn off the stop tap for which I was extremely grateful as the whole bungalow would have been flooded before the plumber got to me. The plumber fixed everything ok.,HomeServe
"Apart from waiting 5 days to fix my sink, so I had to do myself. The engineer turned up to inspect my repair and best to have piece of mind ",HomeServe
"The plumber did fix the leak he was a very polite man.Unfortunately he changed the pipe work so that none of  the panels fitted back . My son in law had to come round after work and put right the problems I was left with ,as I have my house on the market and I had a viewing two days after the initial leak.I am an elderly lady  and this did cause me some distress.",HomeServe
Very easy to set up my cover. Combined with plumbing cover it gives a great peace of mind.,HomeServe
"Homeserve weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re great, from the first phone call they sent a guy to inspect the problem the next day, he inspected the job and it was a two man dig up works job, so he phoned homeserve up there and then and booked the work for the day after.

"We had an overflow from our water tank in the loft. An engineer came and fixed the overflow. However, on his departure, we found that the tank made a noise as it was refilling following a lavatory flush. A second engineer came on our request a week later and solved the problem. We no longer have an overflow or a noisy tank. ",HomeServe
Engineers diagnosed the location of the water leak and fixed it in the same day.  They tidied up afterwards.,HomeServe
"It was necessary for Homeserve to make three visits to attend to a quite simple internal surface mounted drain.   Notwithstanding a description of the plumbing problem. Homeserve, sent a drainage engineer to repair an internal plumbing problem.   The first and second plumbing engineers mis diagnosed the water leak problem.   The third plumbing engineer was excellent and effected repairs within 45 minutes.   Damaged carpets were the direct result",HomeServe
"This is my third time of using HomeServe and although on this occasion the call out time was  quick, I was informed that my policy doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover heating pipes when it comes to leaks, very frustrated as thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I had assumed I was paying the premium for. The first two occasions the plumbers had stated that they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do a separate job as it will involve too much manual work.Overall left quite upset as I was in a crisis with a leak, will look for another provider in the future as too unreliable after having been promised that we will always get it right when reviewing the policy. ",HomeServe

"So glad i have this cover , Ive had a problem with downstairs loo house is quiet old , so pluming could be undergroud , the engineers came out quickly , which was great but work couldnt be carried out effiently as it took 4 appointments for this person then this person with a camera then had to have it unblocked to be told they could of unblocked it , to wait for a plumer to install my toilet back in .. it was great,. But unfortunately it started to flood up under the loo after a week again , so hoping that i havent got to wait for 4 different ppl to come when x2 ppl could sort it out !! When you call they just pass on the work they dont inform the engineers what is needed . Which really it could cut down time down the engineers would know what is needed .. but its very efficient service unfortunately ive had to go into hospital so not home till wednesday , but they have arranged for someone to come out on the Wednesday ... its a great service to be insured with ... so glad i have Homeserve ..

" My upstairs cold water was not running.However hot water was OK. Water pressure downstairs was cer good.The engineer who arrived checked it and try various things, and at the end, he said that both upstairs basins needed to be replaced since their filters were blocked.I bought new taps and called a plumber to fit them.However, this did not improve the water flow at all. ",HomeServe
It was easy to book an appointment on line to suit me.  The leak in my driveway was repaired on the day booked and the drive returned to normal.  The person who did the repair was very friendly and explained what he was doing.  He also read the water meter for me.  A good experience with HomeServe as usual.  ,HomeServe
"Kyle mended my dripping tap, it was completed very quickly and he was very courteous",HomeServe
The technician fixed the constant running water in my toilet but now the cistern takes an age to fill up.,HomeServe
"Two visits from different engineers. Second set of engineers did not appear to have a record of the first visit. However, they may have diagnosed where the problem might be located. They wanted to inspect the soil stack just above a ground floor window. One engineer asked the other if they had a ladder. Neither engineer had one. I offered my ladder but they declined and so the stack was not inspected. I was disappointed to be informed that I would have to get a builder to carry out all necessary preparation work to expose the internal drain. I was not confident about your company carrying out the work and engaged a company that I know. I am now considering whether to cancel my direct debit if I am not going to use your services. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exact date as away at the moment and do not have my diary with me.",HomeServe
"Our toilet flush broke and we were unable to flush the toilet. My wife and I are both pensioners, and the house has only one toilet. When I explained the problem to the telephone operator at Homeserve, they arranged for a plumber to fix it on the same day. The service we received could not have been any better. We are very grateful and very glad we had this insurance. ",HomeServe
"Arrived on time, the leak was not an easy find and the floor had to be removed, the only reason its not 5 is because there was supposed to be 2 people as the one that turned up was new to the job and should have been supervised, it was also a 2 person job but I was able to help which may not always be the case.",HomeServe
Thank you Luke for repairing the cistern on 5 thousand August and Sam repairing and replacing tap in the kitchen and bathroom Both engineers were very professional and efficient ,HomeServe

The plumber was friendly and good at his job.  The only problem was the over 4 hour wait. ie 12-6 timeline.,HomeServe
"The engineer responded in a way I found disrespectful and arrogant, when I raised the issue of jetting. He did not use jets, and eventually gave his reasons, just before going.I expect the problem to recur shortly, and I am entitled to expect excellent service to justify the huge retainer you have demanded.He had also arrived without calling first, as had been promised.This was a disappointing experience.",HomeServe

"My toilet was blocked.  Homeserve was out to me within 2 hours.  Drains were clear.  When Homerserve plunged the toilet the pipes at the back of the toilet came off (seals were perished) and whole toilet flooded with sewage water.  Homerserve sent an emergency plumber, again arrived within 2 hours, who fitted the new part and wet vacced the bathroom.  After me bleaching the floor a few times it's all smelling great and toilet working perfectly.",HomeServe
Homeserve kept us fully informed off the leak from our upstairs hand basin. It wasn't a easy repair as the ceiling in the kitchen had to be cut into to get at the leaking pipe. This was further complicated as the ceiling was artexed so had to be check for any asbestos. Once clear the two plumbers quickly repaired the leak and made the pipework more secure to prevent any more problems. Very efficant,HomeServe

Your engineer was Excellent very very good at his job   I thought he was only going to rod the toilet but he went to his van got out a camera to see where the blockage was went to a drain and he but his rods into the drain but it did not clear went to a second drain did the same but the blockage was still there went to his van again and said we have another drain which we did not know about he moved some soil which was covering the drain  on lifting the third drain the stench was tremendous and that is where the blockage was in the third drain which we did not know was there and we have lived in the property for nearly 40 years your engineer deserves all the PRAISE I can give him he kept going until he came to the root of my problem very commendable I AM VERY VERY PLEASED ,HomeServe
The person who came to mend the leak int he toilet was very good but he discovered a leak in the cistern. Apparently he is not able to mend it as we have another toilet but it is upstairs and both my husband and i have arthritis so it is hard to have to go upstairs every time.I am concerned to find that it is not covered when we pay such a lot of money for the privilege of Homeserve.,HomeServe
Phoned with a burst pipe and was put on a emergency list to be seen . The plumber turned up within the time scale and had to deal with a very difficult neighbour as had to turn off the water supply.  He did a quick and very efficient job and was finished within 20 mins . He left the space clear and clean . Excellent ,HomeServe
Above and beyond- wonderful help just when we needed it and real pride in a job well done. Lovely to meet your plumbing engineer. ,HomeServe

"My job required 2 visits and what a contrast between the 2 plumbers! Peter (2nd visit) was helpful, hard working and pleasant to deal with. Very much a can-do attitude. The first guy was the opposite, everything was too much trouble! Consistency is required when it comes to customer service.",HomeServe
"Chris and Dave could not have done a better job.  Using their camera, back-pressure hose and ""flail"" they got rid of all the limescale in the pipe that was causing our blockage. They worked solidly for 2-3 hours to sort it - far better than an emergency plumber we'd had previously. Exellent service",HomeServe

"Beginning with a telephone call and a very helpful person, appointment made plumber on time work carried out quickly cleanly and professionally, canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fault the service .",HomeServe
Excellent Plumber however drains person should have attended instead. This was down to the fault of the recorded message feature where I was asked to describe the issue I was having. I had the same problem previously with an electrical call out. Please replace this digital feature on your phone line and let users speak to a person.The Plumber came out within 30 minutes and was able to solve my problem but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t carry drain rods with him so I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how long before I will need another call-out.,HomeServe

"I had a leak in a water pipe buried behind a retaining wall. It was a difficult job that required a scaffolding for health and safety reasons. The two men that fixed the pipe were polite, kept me informed of the progress and options I could make. It took just over a morning to fix.I have no complaints. Date is approx.",HomeServe
Excellent service.  Having found water dripping through my ceiling around 4.30am I checked my policy with HomeServe which stated 24/7 service so I rang about 5am and spoke to a lady who assured me it would be dealt with that day.  By 12 noon I had an engineer looking at it for me.,HomeServe
"Possibly the most disorganised organisation I have ever had the misfortune to deal with, they do not know what they are doing. Quite unable to even begin to sort out a leaking pipe because it is buried under concrete which was made abundantly clear to them on the phone.   They started off by sending in a plumber with a spanner,  he walked in said he couldn't do it and it needed a leak detection team which he would organise. He didn't, he closed the job so we started again.  After a further week (during which time I had to organise my own plumber to give emergency cover - the leak is on going)  we got someone out who identified where the leak was. That was the last we heard from Homeserve, it took 4 or 5 phone calls until they reluctantly agreed to send someone to price the job up.  Guess who turned up ? - a plumber!  He couldn't price it up... he said ""because the leak was under concrete"" He took some photos and said he needed to organise a leak detection team!!  He left saying ring Homeserve if you haven't heard within a week, so the circle starts again and the leak remains.  Honestly I am fully expecting the chuckle brothers to be the next people that turn up. almost 3 weeks on and we are no further forward, I am writing to Which and the F.O.S. because I believe they are ignoring us in an effort to avoid doing the work.   If you are thinking of insuring via Homeserve - don't.  ",HomeServe

Experienced some water leaking from shower into the kitchen below. On examination it was obvious that sealant applied when the bathroom was made watertight some years ago had become unstuck. I contacted Home Serve and an appointment was made for 6 days time. I also had a dripping tap in a bedroom wash basin.The Home Serve operative appeared on the day booked. and was unable to carry out any work on the bathroom sealant as he said they did not deal with wet rooms. As is was not an emergency I accepted this but pointed out that I had two jammed taps in our utility room. He corrected those as well as the bedroom tap and I was left with all my taps in working order for which I am most gratefulMy only complaint is that it was not made clear that wet rooms were not covered when I made the initial cll.,HomeServe
The plumber was helpful and arrived when he said he would ,HomeServe
Although the insurance was supposed to be for a leak it didn't include the leak we had!Will not be renewing,HomeServe
Very happy with work carried out. Prompt service to put in a new stop tap as original stop tap seized.,HomeServe
The service was prompt and the man was very thorough. I would have happily given five stars if the pipes didn't clog up again two days later. I'm afraid the blockage was not cleared so we will have to try again.,HomeServe

The best thing is the reassurance that someone will be able to deal with emergencies as quickly as possible.  James came in the afternoon after the leak was discovered in the morning.  Water leaks through the ceiling are very stressful.,HomeServe
Easy to deal with.The speed in which my water leak was dealt with was exceptional.I spoke to a Homeserve rep regarding our problem and within 24 hours the repair was made.So pleased I had Homeserve Cover and would highly recommend them to others.,HomeServe
Booking online was very simple and quick.  I also called and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The plumber who came out wasn't either particularly.  He started by complaining a lot about the situation and eventually fixed it but didn't tell me anything about it and initially I thought he hadn't solved the problem. ,HomeServe
They were easy to deal with quick and efficient. They booked us in for the next day. Plumber came job done. Would recommend them. ,HomeServe

Partial blockage Shower/toilet:1. Sent plumber with electric plunger - no Joy.2. Engineer with camera - it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go round corners! 3. Asked for engineer to check air intake valve in roof before they started to rip the shower room apart. He went up into loft- saw the electric air con in roof said AIV attached to this - said it was not covered and would report such.4. My partner who is 75 went up into roof to look.  AIV not attached the engineer didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look properly. He took this off to get a replacement. Everything worked perfectly with it off. Replaced the AIV partial blockage came back (lots of air in system but cleared when drain in shower was off)???  So we are back to square one and no one came back to us. ,HomeServe
What can i say booking the callout was simple the engineer turned on time he was very professional and identified the problems quickly. The resulting outcome was that he advised two new taps were required and duly left to search replacements. He returned with two new taps and two flexi connecter leads. He replaced the items cleaned up and left it all working perfectly.The thing that surprised me most was when I asked him how do I pay for the replacement parts and his reply took me by surprise he said if the items could not be repaired then they need to be replaced and added that I do not have to pay anything. It remains to be seen how the annual price goes up on the renewal date. However so far I am more than pleased ,HomeServe
"The service was great, response time was quick and the representatives polite and understanding of my incident.  I had a leak from my water tank in the loft.  In summary, they ordered a new tank and fitted it a week later.  All the work was great but unfortunately they didn't take the old one away (it was left in the loft) and a lot of my insulation in the loft was moved around and not put back.  These are the only things that tarnished my experience but the actual resolve of the leak was great !",HomeServe
We had a pipe leak in the bathroom which dripped through the light fitting into the hall below.  We had 3 visits from plumbers but the last one by John Scott fixed it properly.

"Booking an engineer was easy and simple to do.Engineer turned up on time and assessed the issue and had to return to the property.Engineer returned to the property but the problem wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as first thought and he was unable to fix it as homeserve doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover man hole covers.Disappointed that the job couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be completed, he left a large hole which I then needed to cover up with something.

Was able to get an appointment soon. The Plumber was very polite and made a very good job of the repair,HomeServe
The original appointment was not adhered to and I was telephoned to say that it could be up to 10 PM. This was not acceptable and so it was deferred to the following day between 1 PM and 6 PM. After five I telephoned to be told that the engineer was coming and at 5:55 PM he had still not arrived but telephoned to say that he didn't think he could do the job because the fault was on the metre side of the pipe. Where he had obtained this information I do not know because that is not where it was. As a result the visit was deferred again until the following day when he turned up early in the morning and fixed the problem quite quickly. I only hope that the water ingress into the floor has not caused any further damage.,HomeServe
"Quick reply on the phone, same morning appointment, very good plumber came and fixed my dripping tap by putting new ones in, very nice man and very polite. Excellent.",HomeServe

Good appointment availability prompt response and engineer who initially attended confirmed that we didn't have an outside water leak the following day a plumber came and changed the parts of a dual flush toilet which may have been leaking and this seems to have solved the problem.

"We'd had a problem with the downstairs toilet for a while - cistern not working properly. We tried to fix it without success, so we decided to contact HomeServe (for the first time).

After a bit of a challenge from the Homeserve operator, he said that he would put me through to a senior person. Thankfully, the lady was very helpful and a plumber arrived a couple of hours later. Unfortunately, I looked at the pipework under the sink the next morning and it was still leaking slightly, so I rang Homeserve again and they arranged for another plumber to attend the following day, which was fine as it was only a slight leak but still needed attention. So all was good in the end.",HomeServe
"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had a persistent issue with my drainage and every engineer whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s come to investigate has been excellent, and the issue is now resolved after much perseverance! I want to especially shout out to Mark Lockwood who is not only excellent at his job but goes above and beyond to provide amazing customer service. I had the pleasure of having Mark come out twice and both times he was exemplary. As a woman living alone, I often dread having engineers and other workmen in my home but Mark was so friendly and kind, it was never a worry for me. He is very kind, considerate and helpful, even chatting to my cats! Thank you to everyone at homeserve and especially Mark - this insurance is defo worth the money. ",HomeServe
"We were able to get an urgent appointment to fix our toilet, as we only have the one and my husband is disabled. The plumber who came out was prompt, friendly, efficient and very kind and helpful. Very satisfied with the service provided.",HomeServe
A very easy application process.Good price that offers me peace of mind in the event of a problem with my plumbing and drainage ,HomeServe
"Very grateful for the service I received. I think his name was Luke. Replaced the faulty valve in my tank, and I am no longer experiencing awful low droning noise when I run my bath. I was not charged for this as the first call out, the work not done.Thanks.  Great team.",HomeServe
He went above and beyond to fix the stop tap prior to our new kitchen being installed. ,HomeServe
The plumber immediately detected the problem swiftly purchased necessary parts . Job done in 1/2 hr. He made it look so simple and was happy to show me how it was done Very polit gentleman,HomeServe
"I was so happy for your quick response to my request for a quick remedy to my dripping tap, wish I had done this much sooner!   Thank you. ",HomeServe
"The engineer claimed that our septic tank was full. I did say I was surprised as it is just full of water he did not clear the blockage and told me I had to get the tank cleaned and after he left I rodded the pipe and there was a fat build up inside and the water flowed again. It has subsequently blocked again not so bad so I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cleared all the blockage, I will need to rid again. We called you to do a professional job of clearing the pipe but this didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happen. I am very reluctant to spend another Ã‚Â£30 call out fee for nothing to be done again. ",HomeServe
"The gentleman that came was very polite and respectful of my property, he checked everything for me, but unfortunately the problem I had wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered by my insurance, but he advised me as to what part I needed for the shower, so I was able to contact a plumber and explain my problem",HomeServe
"He was good and told me what the matter was, the shower is good now thank you ",HomeServe
"Colin the engineer was great, very polite and professional and completed the repair of the leaking pipe under the patio.Felt very sorry fir him having to work in the pouring rain.",HomeServe
"Quick call out, decent plumber who knew his stuff, job finished quickly",HomeServe
The plumber arrived promptly and fixed the problem quickly - it turned out to be a simple matter but was beyond our capability. The experience made our subscription to HomeServe worthwhile.,HomeServe
The engineer attended for 10 minutes and and advised to pour a bucket of water down the drain. No resolution and will soon be on my 3rd attempt to retreive my excess payment as each time I have to go through the same issues with customer care to do what the person before was supposed to. ,HomeServe
"The Plumer arrived within the time he said. He was polite, efficient and tidy up after he had completed the work. I was very pleased with the service.",HomeServe
"Absolutely appalling! Cover taken out for emergenciesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦..so the first appointment they could offer was 4 days away. Reluctantly had to agree, even though we were unable to use the kitchen sink ( and how useful an item is that??). Half an hour before the deadline time on the day they called to say couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it, and offered another slot in 2 days!!!Have to say that after I erupted they offered the following day, which was keptÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦..albeit by a very surly engineer",HomeServe
"I had a problem with some internal plumbing connected to a mechanism, which to rectify need considerable work and spare parts which were no longer available.The Plumber carried out a thorough inspection and then explained the complexity of the problem which couldn't be fixed.  I was refunded the Ã‚Â£30.00 which was debited at the point of making an appointment.Although my problem wasn't  solved I felt Home Serve acted well, on this occasion. ",HomeServe
The response on reporting the leak was prompt ,HomeServe
Your engineer who mended our loo flush was very efficient and really helpful.,HomeServe
Fixed a problem with my loo plumbing. My mum was in tears (of joy). Thank you. Totally worth getting this cover with a refreshingly fuss free handling. ,HomeServe
"Prompt response from my contacting you., and excellent service from the the plumber who did the repairs.",HomeServe
Engineer arrived on time - after telephoning me to advise of his anticipated arrival time - he understood problem and despite difficulties in access was both able to identify cause of the leak and resolve matters efficiently - despite the need at one point to go off-site in order to obtain replacement parts.He maintained good humour and a confident manner throughout (despite it taking longer than he anticipated) and tidied up afterwards leaving me feeling very confident and pleased with his work.,HomeServe
The plumber was very efficient repairing my tap.  He arrived in the time frame I was given.,HomeServe
"I liked the ease of booking and swift resolution to the problem. However, as there were 2 toilet cisterns that needed attending to, only one was fixed. I believe this is due to them getting paid a call out fee for every job rather than them appreciating the monthly fees that I have been paying for nearly 2 years with only 1 call out previously. ",HomeServe
The young man who came to unblock our shower was outstanding....,HomeServe
I booked a plumber from 12pm. It was cancelled at 4.30pm and rebooked. The guy who came was excellent and cleared my drain within 15 minutes. I was impressed.,HomeServe

"I was most impressed with Homeserve from my initial contact with them when I spoke to a polite well spoken call handler who took the details of the problems I was having through to the tradesman who came out to my property to repair the leaking and damaged outside waste pipes and the damaged outside tap. It was the first time I have had to call on the services of Homeserve in the Seven years that I have been a client of theirs, and the experience was first class from the initial call handler through to the tradesman who visited my property to put right the issues we had.The works required took two morningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because materials had to be ordered, but when the work was completed it was completed to a high standard and was very neat, whilst the tradesman himself was professional, polite and without doubt a good advert for Homeserve the company!I would without hesitation recommend Homeserve to all my family and friends because my experience was such a good one!",HomeServe

Quick same day solution to problem with the drains,HomeServe
"Swift action on a none emergency leak. Drains replaced within a matter of days, did not impact us at all. Still had a leak, they came straight back and investigated and sorted it straight away.Great service would recommend ",HomeServe

BRILLIANT                         (Date below is an estimate)",HomeServe
Very pleasing prompt service to find source of a water leak which occured on 4th July and replacement of leaking tap was immediately done. Water damage repairs to ceiling below was completed on 27th August. Rather a long interval but job was done very well.,HomeServe
Rang homeserve when we had a leak coming through the ceiling. The lady on the phone was very helpful and booked for an emergency plumber within 4 hours. We called back as the leak had stopped and was due to emptying a bath. She cancelled the emergency call out and assured us a plumber would call the next morning to book an appointment. The plumbing company called first thing and booked an appointment at a convenient time for us. The plumber arrived on time and was very helpful. The problem was solved. I would definitely recommend using home serve for peace of mind. ,HomeServe
"Plumber arrived on time and within the week. As before, two jobs were requested and one got done. This time my request was for a thermostatic valve on my shower mixer. This is not in the schedule. I have requested a Ã‚Â£30 refund. The toilet tank water valve was changed this time. Previously, a repair was requested for the toilet but no joy because the fault did not show when the plumber flushed the toilet. I have belatedly requested a Ã‚Â£30 refund, which has been agreed. The kitchen tap was changed. I am really not sure whether Homeserve is worth it financially.",HomeServe
I had a small leak under my sink and was so worried.  Engineer attended and was so professional and sorted everything out for me by putting tape on part of my stop tap... Very happy. I had an evening appointment between 5-10pm which was good for me as didn't need to book time off work. ,HomeServe
"Managed to get a plumber in within a couple of days, he was tidy and polite and got the job done quickly.",HomeServe
"Whilst the blockage was resolved by moving the materials causing it, no effort was made to resolve the root cause and prevent it happening again, even though the Homeserve representatives who attended on the first two calls said that this would be done. Eventually told that remediation not covered in policy although I can see no such wording to that effect. Even though Homeserve say it is now fully resolved this is still not the case, and it is only a matter of time before I have to raise another incident, and have to pay the associated charges for this.",HomeServe
Not too long before engineer called to fix leaking drinking water pipe.Excellent operator and had the experience to adapt modus operandi to enable result to be obtained for a satisfactory solution.,HomeServe
"Your staff quickly identified the source of the problem a hole in the outside drainpipe on 9.8.24. They returned on 16.8.24 and replaced what turned out to be a fully broken pipe with new plus drain fitting. The result was a very neat and tidy job, and they took the time to explain the work being carried out, which was appreciated.",HomeServe

"So we've had HomeServe previously but cancelled it because of the incompetence in try to fix two leaking taps that we ended up fixing at our own cost and cancelled the policy.They eventually tempted me back with an introductory offer of only Ã‚Â£9 for the first year.Roll on 11 months into this new offer....this time we had what turned out to be a collapsed underground rainwater outflow pipe.  The problem was diagnosed quickly.  They came back four days later and installed a completely new rainwater outflow system in very unobtrusive way, and even restored the tiles they had to remove, even putting them back a better condition than when they arrive.  All credit to the two staff concerned.",HomeServe
"Easy to book appointment, contacted on the day to advise arrival time. Identified problem quickly an replacement parts required. Surprised unable to locate parts within local area, despite several plumbers merchants and supplier. Only paid Ã‚Â£30 excess. ",HomeServe

"Telephone response was good. Plumber was very efficient, helpful and friendly.",HomeServe
"Had appointment cancelled on me twice when engineer was meant to come out. Staff on telephone confirmed that a leaking sink could be replaced by an engineer if i was to purchase this but this was not the case. To be fair to the engineer who came out, he was courteous and understanding and explained that homeserve were unable to fit in new sinks. I just wish i was told this on the phone during at least one of the previous telephone calls.",HomeServe
Toilet wouldnt flush! Hot tap leaking in bathroom too. So called homeserve and came within a couple of hours and fixed both jobs! Very helpful polite and got jobs done without any fuss. Will be sticking with homeserve for definite.,HomeServe

The plumber diagnosed the problem straight away and fixed it very well,HomeServe
PLUMBER TURNED UP IN GOOD TIME COMMUNICATION WAS VERY GOOD AND VERY CLEAN AND TIDY WORKER,HomeServe
"Plumber called to let us know he was on his way. He was helpful and friendly as he did the work, which he did thoroughly. He also checked that all was rectified before he left.",HomeServe
"As to the service given by home serve I am severely disgusted with the service and follow up my original call. Which was not followed up, I did as required by the email sent to me stating that all I need to do was contact the relevant number to have instant contact with a call handler. Having booked relevant time period needed for my repair I expected the appropriate service within the appropriate time period that day. This did not happen, and although once I had contacted home serve again an hour after the original plumber should have visited the call handler could not help me. But suggested that I should put in a complaint if I was dissatisfied with the service that home served gave.This has left my disabled wife distressed and concerned that if there is another plumbing incident and she was on her own she may be left for up to 48 hours with either no water or flooding within our house if I am not at home.We believe it is not the appropriate way to handle emergencies be them plumbing or otherwise. And will of course tell not only my neighbours but the community which we live in the dissatisfaction we have with HomeServe.they have taken not only our Ã‚Â£3oo+ money but then takes another Ã‚Â£30 for the call out and noyt even said sorry ",HomeServe

Homeserve dealt with my plumbing problem very quickly and efficiently. The plumber himself was absolutely first class.    This was a truly positive experience.         Thank you,HomeServe
"I did not like dealing with a machine, every time I phoned, especially after your plumber could not turn the water off in the street advising me that I needed to call in South East Water. After a week of pressing them to come they arrived and turned the water off easily, it was embarrassing for me.Then I had to get back to you again for another plumber to come to fix it without difficulty, again it was a machine,",HomeServe
Sorted in 5 mts. A blocked outside drain . All good now! ,HomeServe
"Already have a plumbing and drainage contract, don't think I've had to use them yet but better safe than sorry and very good value ",HomeServe

"Great service, the  very prompt arrival by the drainage expert, who was able to clear the blockage, and checked all other draines were working fully - top bloke Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»",HomeServe
Called out due to a leak was told I had to pay the access before I was even passed over to the relevant person who would try and get someone to come out. No guarantee that anyone would come out that evening.Lucky someone did and the job was not completed properly and then I had to call out home assist through my home insurance .Felt I should have callled them first .Second time this has happened not impressed to be honest.Thank you for your prompt reply however the repairman did actually turn off the wrong pipe this is why it was still leaking sorry forgot to mention this in the first place Thank you ,HomeServe

"I booked a plumber because waste water in the kitchen sink backing up from the basement. This's happened more than 2 years ago, so I knew what was wrong. I told the plumber most lightly the fault of the washer under the sink and please change it. He blamed my other pipes have an issue and that its not included or under in Homeserve policy agreement. Terrible service with laughable excuses and the Issue not fixed. Complete waste of time and money. Subsequently, I got a plumbing from another company and it simply resolved the problem since. ",HomeServe
"Always reliable, on time and great workmanship. It is really useful also to have a phone call from the plumber to tell you he is on the way. ",HomeServe
Although it took three appointments before a plumber actually came to look at my problem when he did he identified the issue very quickly and it has now been fixed. The plumber who attended was very pleasant and helpful.,HomeServe

The plumber came and advised the banging was when the toilets were flushed. He could rectify one but to rectify the second I would need to make another appointment and pay another Ã‚Â£30. So, only one toilet mended and we still have banging pipes.",HomeServe
The new flush installed by Homeserve is good quality and uses less water.,HomeServe
Quick and easy to set up plumbing and drainage cover. ,HomeServe
They wanted to continue examination and assessment whilst the leak was continuing which is not acceptable.,HomeServe

"We signed up with Home serve earlier in the year thinking that after a bad experience with our plumber last September it would be a good idea to have someone to turn to in an emergency, recently we found that we had a leak in our toilet and immediately contacted Home serve, I was unused to having to deal with AI at first but I was told that someone would come the next morning and would phone me before they arrived to let me know that they were on their way, I found this reasuring because it is worrying to have a stranger turn up on your doorstep unannounced. He came as promised within about 10 minutes and solved the problem in under an hour, cleaned up after himself and was on to his next call, can't recommend this service highly enough!! 100 per cent happy!

Really quick and easy to book an appointment for a plumber -all done automatically. And the plumber arrived on time and fixed the problem with no fuss,HomeServe
I had two leaking taps but the tradesman who came was adamant he could only repair one. That meant I would have to pay another Ã‚Â£30 to get the other tap fixed. Total rip off. Will be cancelling the policy.,HomeServe
"Woke up to a leak in airing cupboard, shorted the electrics, dripping in the hall. Managed to isolate and called Homeserve. Forgot I had a Ã‚Â£50 excess which I had to pay before they'd get someone along. Promised a callout within a few hours - arrived same day 5 hours later - ok, not an emergency. Took the guy 2 minutes to identify problem - fractured shower pump. Pump not covered, plumber left. Sorted local plumber, cost Ã‚Â£245 for new pump fitted. OK, it's an emergency service, I'll keep using Homeserve as long as the monthly cosr (Ã‚Â£13) doesn't markedly increase.",HomeServe

"The earliest appointment I could get was 5 days after calling, the first engineer turned up, said he needed to order parts and left (it was a Monday at midday when all the plumbing suppliers are open so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really understand why he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just go and get what he needed) it was then another 10 days before anyone came back and fixed it in literally 10 minutes. It was only a toilet that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flushing not installing a new bathroom so I am annoyed it took so long.",HomeServe
"Engineer had no empathy for my belongings. Came to mend a leaking tap.  Left kitchen in a disgusting mess, with cleaning products strewn all over the floor and water on the floor and in cupboard",HomeServe

"Great Company,Kept me informed by text message when they would arrive to fix leak .Was all sorted within a couple of days .Highly recommend Homeserve . Keep up the good work.",HomeServe
"When the guys turn up, on the morning that was given, they got going found the area of the leak. They put a new piece of pipe in. It took about 4 1/2 hours to complete. The repair seems good.However my disappointed was that someone came 2 weeks prior to fix this leak. He left 2 hours later not finding the leak. Telling me it was a two man job so they would ring with a new appointment date. This is my disappointed that date given to me was 2 weeks later. Not good enough.",HomeServe

"HomeServe are a very professional outfit, and ( being 70+ ) I really value the peace of mind of the full range of services.On this particular occasion I unfortunately had a blocked drain, which the Engineer ( David ) dealt with  very efficiently indeed. I had an internal toilet issue a few months ago which he solved with similar aplomb.Can't fault the process.....",HomeServe
On a second visit from a different engineer he was able to succeed in getting the main water stopcock operational again so it would shut off properly.,HomeServe

"HomeServe responded very promptly  to my request for help with a blocked drain. The engineer who came round couldn't have been more helpful. Solved the problem and got the drain running freely once more. He also gave me free advice on a couple of other issues that were worrying me. Fantastic service and highly recommended, ",HomeServe
20 stars.I just had another amazing visit from a homeserve engineer. This is a complex household we were struck by lightning we have multiple issues we are unpicking to do with water electricity and gas.I have cover for both plumbing and electrics. Both the plumber who arrived today and the electricians who were here 3 weeks ago have been AMAZING. Thanks to today's visit from the plumber he has resolved my water issue and done a sterling job.He got my hot water running replaced a valve on my water tank and got my hot water running. We are sooo delighted with the on going support over the last 3 weeks thank you again.,HomeServe
"The service was very good, the staff who attended our blocked drain were pleasant, friendly, helpful and efficient. However I do not like the initial automated (AI) answer system I want to talk to a human being. When I was transferred to a living being they were as helpful and friendly as the engineer who attended to sort out our problem ",HomeServe
"Whilst the scheduling was a bit of an issue I have to complement the field engineers who came to my property to fix a broken sewer. The initial technician who came to survey was excellent, diligent in finding and reporting the problem. Then the technician who came to complete the work who I will name as deserves recognition, Andrew Wallington, was an absolute pleasure to have on my property. Respected we have a dog so made sure the gate was always closed, made minimal excavation on my patio and did a first class repair under challenging circumstances. Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â",HomeServe
Had a leak and i was covered by homeserve. One call and the leak was efficiently sorted. Brilliant service highly recommend. ,HomeServe

BLOCKAGE IN BATH DRAIN PLUG NEVER SORTED. COST ME Ã‚Â£30.00 CALL OUT FEE - JUST AS BAD AS EVER,HomeServe
"The plumber who attended let me know in advance of his arrival time, was very neat and tidy, and completed the job very quickly and efficiently.However, we reported a leak which we couldn't contain on Saturday, and it wasn't until the Tuesday morning that someone the plumber turned up to fix it, which we thought was not quite what we'd been paying for.",HomeServe
"Technician arrived during time window previously agreed, having phoned when he was on his way to us. Fairly straight forward repair, however as we were unsure whether the technician would carry the parts to carry out the repair we were very pleased that he had a replacement which meant there was no need for a return visit.",HomeServe
"Leaking tap. First plumber fitted a new tap which I purchased from Wickes. After fitting it he told me I wouldn't be able to use the hose feature of the tap and there was no solution. I requested another callout. 2nd plumber, clearly didn't want to be there, didn't even bring his tools in, shook the tap and said the tap wasn't suitable for a kitchen my size. Told me to call Wickes to obtain a key so that I can clean the filter, Wickes told me there is no such key. Total waste of 2 days off work.",HomeServe
Emergency plumber arrived within 12 hrs.Quick efficient repair,HomeServe

"WasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t impressed,  with the engineer who came out broke my toilet and said itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a crack in it , ",HomeServe
"When the guy arrived following our conversation the day beforeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦we were pleasantly surprised as he was very young but got straight on with the water leak which was in an awkward position under a central isleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦he had to dig into concrete, cut off damaged pipe then replaced with plastic piping and reconnected everythingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ no mess and leak fixed. Very happy with result and now have great shower pressure!!",HomeServe
"Professional, the engineer was great and replaced our leaky tap with no issues . Would definitely recommend.",HomeServe
"Called to discuss as soon as I knew I had an underground leak outdoors. Helpful discussion and informed immediately my policy covered the underground pipe near the boundary of my property. An appointment was booked for three days later. Excellent communication from engineers en route. Arrived early and remained at property for nearly 12 hours to locate, fix keek and test pipe. Re-cemented several dug out steps and left as new. Told that waste from all groundworks would be collected within 3-5 days but was collected the following day.Fantastic service from two competent, knowledgeable, hard working men who clearly knew what to do and were not fazed by the job in any way. Such a refreshing change to come across people who are professional, good tempered and reliable.Thank you so much! ",HomeServe

"Home serve were really good, professional, punctual, patient, very good at explaining everything. Had the pleasure of meeting several engineers/ plumbers all were really good. Would highly recommend. Extensive works done, finding leaks and repairing leaks,,replacement of hot water feed, worked really well with and even spoke with my insurance company, all in all thay made an awful experience bearable. Really good customer service.",HomeServe
I was very impressed by the attention given by the homeserve engineers/plumbers to find the root cause of my plumbing issue. They did not do a quick fix and get out the door asap to go to another job. The staff were courteous and informed me of everything they were doing. I would recommend HomeServe ,HomeServe
"I am giving 4 stars as my booking was initially cancelled the morning the engineer was due to arrive.  Trying to contact someone to actually speak to was very difficult and long winded. I eventually managed to speak to someone and on a positive note someone did come out that same day.Unfortunately though the job was completed it was not fully right so had to arrange for someone to come out again. They did come out the following week and everything is fine now. My biggest criticism is the automated telephone system which gives limited options. Online, when making a claim there is nowhere to add additional information therefore not being able to advise prior to the job exactly what the problem is. I",HomeServe
Booked for dripping tap.Kitchen tap dripping.  Quickly fixed with replacement tap.  Also gave option to follow up against same ticket if replacement tap not satisfactory.  (But it has been fine so haven't needed to).,HomeServe
Relieved to get my toilet working properly so quickly and efficiently,HomeServe
Phoned up to explain that me toilet was not working properlyI was worried that I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find my insurance policy at hand but I need not worry they had it in no time at all and arranged for a very good and helpful plumber to call before lunch the next day When he left he had cleaned up and all was well Thanks go to both the office and the plumber for a brilliant job well done Ã°Å¸â€˜Â ,HomeServe

Brilliant service and all my water leaking sorted. Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬ ,HomeServe
"A very good service, the plumber replaced our leaking tap very quickly and was good at his job.",HomeServe
It was so easy pay the excess and they send someone round the next day. I had one of these fancy taps which pushed down to sink level but was always loose. Some plumbers wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even touch it others did and it would get loose. I was on the verge of changing a new sink to resolve a tap issue. Sandeep their plumber sorted it within 30 mins and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still tight. Genius. No flapping round as we had a lovely lad come round for drains who told us the importance of keeping water in shower drain outlet to stop smells rising. Two call outs in total both issues resolved. I was on the promotional rate. Unfortunately I have to canx as the new monthly charge is not value for money along with Ã‚Â£30 access each call out. ,HomeServe
Excellent service both on the phone and on site. Very easy to book a slot and the plumber was very helpful and very tidy ,HomeServe
The people that attended my leak were excellent. The only problem I have is with the company not the people who work for them for some unknown reason they have prepared the same pipe on a number of occasions. I hope this helps in someway thank you.,HomeServe
The plumber came and done a very good job to my toilet. It works brilliantly now. ,HomeServe
"If you do not fit the part on my tank problem,I did not call you to just look at it, tell me the problem,I am willing to pay you for the part charges. I waisted my Ã‚Â£ 30.00 for nothing. ",HomeServe
"The plumber arrived on time, Spotted the problem almost immediately and fixed it very quickly. One of my better decisions , signing up to HomeServe. I would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone as great value for money.",HomeServe
Hi the lady who came and fixed my toilet was great. It is now working perfectly. ,HomeServe
Not for the first time you have been helpful and prompt in dealing with my problem.  One little point - He told me that there was no problem with my section of the sewer but it was in the area that is the responsibility of South West Water.  I thought he would either send me a report or contact them direct but neither has happened. What do I do next please?,HomeServe
"Call centre not helpful, more interested in getting our credit card details to pay excess than dealing with problem.  Had to wait almost 24 hours for plumber who was very helpful and apologetic, he was obviously rushed off his feet.  Perhaps more local plumbers would be helpful instead of one who lives nearly an hour away, not much use in a real emergency.",HomeServe
"Cant fault, no issues easily sorted.Well mannered telephone operator, The plumber came round 3 hours and fixed the leak.",HomeServe
"THE GUY THAT COME WAS VERY GOOD HE CHANGED THE  TAP HEADS TO THE WASH BASIN BUT ON LEAVING I NOTICED THE COLD TAP WAS STILL DRIPPING  SO I CALLED HIM BACK TO TAKE ALOOK HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE FINE, IT IS STILL DRIPPING NOW I HAVE TO REALLY TURN IT OFF HARD TO STOP IT",HomeServe
Water Pipe Leak.The intial call to explain the problem went well but when the engineer came the following morning it was the sewage engineer to unblock a drain when the problem reported was a leaking water pipe. Then it took 3 more days for a plumber to come to fix the leak.,HomeServe
The plumber did a really professional job talked me through every step of the process and left the job clean and tidy,HomeServe
"your engineer arrived on time, found where leak was and said he would send a report. Still waiting, have heard nothing since",HomeServe
It was easy to book an appointment online and the wait wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too bad either. The PlumberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s communication was great and sorted the issue out quickly and efficiently. A really nice chap called Dean. Thank you. ,HomeServe
"The HomeServe plumber was on time and was methodical and thorough in his testing to find the problem leak and explained things well, in a friendly manner.",HomeServe
He arrived on time worked hard with the leak cleared up and all sorted in approx 2 hrs,HomeServe
"I have used this service several times ,they have always responded very quickly and at a time suitable to me .The tradesmen  have always been .efficient ,polite and cleared up after the job   On only one occasion  they were unable to complete the task due to lack of spares for the ancient appliance but they isolated  the leak .  I will have to replace the bidet for a newer model",HomeServe
"James did an absolutely fantastic job in repairing the leak from my cistern in no time and he tightened the lose wash-hand basin tap pipes which had given way and had caused some flooding prior to his arrival. I could not be more thankful to him. He is a star and a true asset to Homeserve. Polite, Friendly and Professional. Supper happy with the service received. Thank you again James",HomeServe
Very efficient and easy to book appointment online.Arrived bang on time and resolved the blocked drain within half an hour.,HomeServe
Very poor time management and customer services. They gave me a time slot from 8am to 6pm and never updated me on the time left to wait. I called three times to ask for updates and never got any information. The plumber eventually arrived at almost 9pm. They had pushed my appointment to a further slot from 5pm to 10pm without any previous notice. They really showed lack of respect for customer. ,HomeServe
"The plumber was very polite, he was very helpful and we were amazed with how well  he repaired the leak.Thank you very much for your service. ",HomeServe
"Our engineers name was James who in my mind is an excellent plumber he found our leak in our bathroom toilet.James took the cistern apart and found the problem,he asked if he could get the parts delivered directly to us so he could return a few days later to replace the parts which he did very efficiently in a clean and tidy manner. I would recommend Homeserve to anyone,thank you.",HomeServe
" 1. Repair of kitchen taps. This took place on the Sunday. Replaced washers and internal mechanism so essentially were were given new taps. Excellent service. Kind very polite and present engineer. 2.He also examined  our failed WC, identified fixings were well corroded and that removing them would break the porcelain and eventually said it needed replacing. Since it was our only loo he told us the loo would be replaced with a new ""Bog in a Box"". Explained there would be no further charges or excess payable because of our need and vulnerability.Monday was a bank holiday so the office would begin planning on the tuesday.Thursday morning  at 8am received phone call from engineer Thomas saying he would be with us in 10minutes. He arrived, removed the old wc and installed the new one in what seemed a speedy operation leaving the loo and bathroom looking great.Thomas arranged for waste removal crew to removed the boxed-up old loo.All operatives were kind and pleasant and did their jobs wonderfully well. The work was given the priority we needed.I give both engineers and the Rubbish Removers 11 out of 10 each for jobs well done.",HomeServe
"We had a bad water leak but it took 4 days before an engineer could come. He did a quick assessment and told us our drive needed digging up and 3 days later an ""outside"" engineer arrived. Our neighbour who built the house got involved and said he didnt think the drive needed digging up and the leak could be fixed from inside. The ""outside"" man said he couldnt touch anything inside and rather than wait for days, our neighbour removed the dishwasher etc so the ""outside"" man could fix the leak and drain the ""swimming pool"" under the house. Our poor neighbour then had to put everything back again. If a proper assessment was done in the first place our neighbour wouldnt have had to give up his time to help us.",HomeServe
The plumber was knowledgeable and most helpful with advice,HomeServe
"The plumber came out when expected and was professional in his work and knowledge, but wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t in the mood of any interaction with me kinda moody i would say, guess it was his last job of the day and just wanted to get home, anyway i was pleased with the outcome.",HomeServe
"Called on 14th August phone answered quickly, came out same day. Engineer found leak, came following week and re routed pipe work on 20th August.  But because it has been re routed it did not feed our toilet cistern. Plumber came two days later inserted new pipe work to fix toilet cistern. All good now no leak very happy ",HomeServe
Very efficient service.Bathroom tap and fitting fixed quickly.,HomeServe
"Although running late, the plumbing engineer was pleasantly efficient and definitely knew his craft. He had lovely manners and apologised for keeping me waiting. The actual job - replacing an outside tap, took less than 10 minutes and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s working fine.",HomeServe
Absolute Faultless...The workmen were brilliant...Almost found the water leak straight away...Homeserve have been first class..as soon as I got in contact with the company they responded straight away ,HomeServe

"Fast and easy service, call centre operator and the guy who found the leak Very Helpful, THANK YOU A1++++++",HomeServe
Had two drips/leaks and had to pay an excess per leak despite booking one visit. When I queried it I was told each drip/leak is classed as an individual claim! Plumber attended and fixed 2 drip/leaks but it turned out I had 2 leaks in the same pipe (so 3 drips in total). The 3rd leak required a further claim so another excess and another visit to repair so needed to use a bucket for a week to collect drip/leak til plumber returned. Company needs to make clear that 2 or more issues on one pipe will require multiple excess payments and multiple visits! On the upside the plumber was efficient and competent and I'm finally drip/leak free.,HomeServe
HiIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry to report that it took a long time to come out to me to fix my blocked toilet but really it was the drain that needed attention.The guy that did attend first couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t unblock the toilet and said someone be with me in half hour - weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll he shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have said that cause no one was coming.He did telephone to say it would be the following day 12-6.I have 1 toilet so this wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t good. I have several illnessesBut the guy that came was really nice saw to the drain which was being Ã¢â‚¬Å“painfulÃ¢â‚¬Â and said he would put in a complaint for me.,HomeServe
It was very helpful to get an expert plumber to see the problem and logically  begin to resolve the issues. Once the spare parts were obtained the problem was resolved in a timely manner. Full marks to the plumber who was outstanding. The weakness in Homeserve system and preventing the problem to be resolved more quickly was that the parts were not availble to be delivered to him/us and the plumber had to go shopping to a well known store to get the ncessary bits. A bad waste of his time.,HomeServe
"Technician phoned well in advance of his arrival, much appreciated. He duly assessed our problem correctly and was able to rectify the malfunction by fitting a new ball valve. Above all he was extremely polite and kind which was much appreciated!  ",HomeServe
"I see that many people have had a good experience with this company.  I'm afraid my contact was vastly inferior to this.  My mother has a Plumbing and Drainage policy on her property, for which I have a registered Power of Attorney.  On the day she went into a nursing home, her neighbour reported to me that water was streaming from the front of the house.  The ballcock had broken off in the downstairs toilet and the cistern was overflowing.  We turned off the water supply and I decided to make a claim on the policy.  My entire conversation was with a robot. I had to describe the issue in two or three words, so I said 'overflowing toilet'.  The robot misunderstood this, and I discovered three days later that it had ordered the drainage service, which was not appropriate.  Also, there was no opportunity to discuss the date and time of the visit.  One option was presented and the machine wanted a yes or no answer.  I was desperate to speak to a human, but this was not an option.This was only the beginning of our problems, however.  The only option for a visit was two days after my initial call.  My brother was due to stay in the house and it had no water and no toilet.  My husband arrived at the property at 8am to wait for the Homeserve plumber.  At about 11.30, we had a call to say he had gone off sick.  There was no offer of another plumber until two days later, four days after the original call. This needed a further five hour wait at the property.  We reluctantly accepted this, as there was no other option, but on ringing customer services, the next day, I discovered the robot's mistake over the type of service we needed.  The case had to be abandoned, and I would have had to start again, with my Ã‚Â£30 excess refunded eventually, and a requirement to pay a further Ã‚Â£30 to secure a different appointment with a plumber rather than a drainage person. We were so frustrated that we declined this option, with its five hour wait, and decided to try and fix the problem ourselves.  The Homeserve premium was higher than various competitors, even with a negotiated reduction.  I accepted it because it was the easy option at the time.  So far, sadly, it has not been worth the money. I suggest that Homeserve alters the robot to allow an option to say whether or not its understanding of the problem is correct.  I also suggest options on the date and time of the visit, as well as the option to speak to a human. Finally, a call on the day to give a more accurate ETA within the five hour window would be really helpful. On a positive note, the lady I eventually spoke to in Customer Services was sympathetic and really helpful, though she was hidebound by an unwieldy system. ",HomeServe
"Clean, polite and punctual. Fixed the problem with no hassle and the flush on our cloakroom toilet works better than ever. Great service.",HomeServe
"We couldn't have been more pleased, After phoning  Homeserve they made a prompt appointment. The  engineer arrived on time and quickly located the leak. He worked efficiently non stop .Repaired the leak, filled in the hole,  re-concreted  the path and left the job clean and tidy. He was friendly and polite .A five star service.",HomeServe
"Engineer called to advise he was on his way prior to visit. He was pleasant and happy to help with my worry about a possible leak from pipes, causing a damp patch on the wall. He checked the pipes and confirmed he could find no leaks to repair.I was refunded Ã‚Â£30 back to my account ...This was much appreciated and great customer service from Homeserve.....Thank youÃ°Å¸ËœÅ ",HomeServe
Engineer arrived on time. Was polite and attended the problems of the cistern and leaking taps promptly. Explained  the cause clearly.,HomeServe
"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had to have homeserve a few times now, each time IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had them the lads have been very very friendly, done an excellent job as well, glad I joined home serve , it gives me a great piece of mind knowing if anything happens with my plumbing, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m covered",HomeServe
"Just brilliant. Booked an emergency callout for a sewer disaster and they came same day. So grateful! Guy who arrived was professional, polite, efficient and quick. Exactly what we needed when we needed it. Can't ask for more than that.",HomeServe
"Update - 12 September - no update or action from HomeServe on the below. As requested, we emailed them details of our dissatisfaction and with our request for how to resolve (please ensure the plumber has a full set of spares for the rescheduled appointment they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn up for). While the email was acknowledged with a promise it would be looked into it and the complaint had been escalated, we have had no contact or update from them at all. Desperately frustrating for what should be a simple fix and shows how service providers do themselves and their brands significant  harm by failing to get key aspects like pro-active communication and following up right. Update 8 Sept - I have replied to email in HomeserveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s response below and await a response. Will post further updates if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re any positive developments.Original review - Such dreadful service. Toilet broke and phoned Homeseve who covers through our Aviva Home Insurance. First plumber attended and said a part needed ordering (which they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have with them) and rebooked the appointment for a weeks time. Second plumber arrived after a week and said the first plumber ordered the wrong part. Ordered the supposed right part and had to wait another week for a third appointment. Third plumber arrived and installed the part. A week later, the toilet has the same issue as before. Phone Homeserve and make a complaint. They arrange for a fourth plumber to attend today between 12-6pm. At 3:45 they phone to say the plumber canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come and the earliest appointment they can offer is next Thursday. Appalling state of professionalism. Asked for the fourth plumber to have all the parts necessary to replace the system but Homeserve state thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not possible so even after the next plumber arrives, there will almost certainly be another weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gap before the parts arrive and installed but no doubt, a fifth different plumber. Dreadful waste, inefficiency and lacking in practical common sense. Will be complaining to Aviva and moving my home insurance to an insurer that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use Homeserve. ",HomeServe
"Very easy to locate the cover that was right for me and easy to set up. Not wanting to have an emergency of any kind but in the event of needing assistance I know Homeserve will be there to deal with it. Peace of mind for me knowing I am covered for plumbing, heating and electrics",HomeServe
Plummer Polite on arrival. Respectful of home. Quickly explained what needed to be done to resolve issue. Repaired taps effectively and efficiently. Cleared up afterwards,HomeServe
We had an issue with our toilet flush and submitted a claim with HomeServe. The plumber arrived around an hour after submitting the claim and fixed the problem.,HomeServe
Plumber could not clear sink drain and HomeServe stated they would not repair. What is the point of this insurance? But they kept the excess charge of Ã‚Â£30:00 !,HomeServe
"Quick and friendly service. Engineer was with us early the morning after the call and located the problem, an underfloor drain, causing a wet floor. Drain cleared and problem solved. Thank you",HomeServe
THE Response was excellent but the job not finish as the plumber could not find where the leaks so he suggested to cut the tails or the word rob i said to him to wait i need to check with my building insurance.,HomeServe
"Had a leaking pipe that was about 2Ã¢â‚¬Â below ground in concrete in an old houseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laundry room. I rang Homeserve at 2200hrs, the Bot was truly poor and a real pain, but once past the Bot, they rang back next morning at 0730, it was dug out, fixed and made good by 1630hrsA really excellent result. The engineer, Ben, couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been more professional nor proficient in fixing a Ã¢â‚¬ËœbuggerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of a repair. A very experienced and capable operator and a credit to Homeserve and not at all like the Ã¢â‚¬ËœcowboyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ plumbers I often come across!This was a really good experience - except the Bot which should be destroyed. ",HomeServe
Easy to book an appointment on the phone & pay Ã‚Â£30 fee. Dan the plumber called to confirm ETA & arrived when he said he would. He was very friendly & professional & explained to me what he was doing to repair my toilet. DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel anxious with him in the house & when he finished he cleaned up after himself. Would recommend Homeserve ,HomeServe
Been with Homeserve for a number of years as an insurance policy. Toilet cistern failed - repair visit booked simply online. Engineer fixed it in 5mins for the cost of the monthly premium. Great,HomeServe
Plumber came out same day to fix burst pipe in bathroom good service,HomeServe
Telephoned explained it was roof drainage. charged Ã‚Â£30. SW water rep came following day and told me it was not covered by homeserve.  Why wasn't I told this when I rang? Rep kindly checked main house drains whilst he was here. ,HomeServe
Communication good and issue was resolved speedily. Excellent plumber and service.,HomeServe
Helpful polite friendly plumber. Left everything clean and tidy. Came out within a couple of days after I called them. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found homeserve really great Ã°Å¸â€˜Â ,HomeServe
Very prompt service and a good job done with no follow up problems. So glad we have HomeServe in place for any plumbing problems we may have.,HomeServe
"The latest plumber sorted out the leak the last plumber left the previous day, for which I was grateful. He also changed the washers on the sink taps, so they no longer leak. ",HomeServe
"It was a quick, easy service. Which is a weight off my mind! The taps were fitted very well and everything was working quickly with minimum disruption.",HomeServe
We are disappointed that the plumber visited the water leakage had not confirmed that the source of the water leak. He had assumed that the leak could be behind the shower control panel but not confirmed that it was. Instead he had suggested we employed an independent plumber to investigate whether the leak was from the shower unit. This is unsatisfactory but not fully investigated. ,HomeServe
"Called on Saturday, plumber arrived bank holiday Monday and completed required work within half an hour from being told he was on the way.Exceptional service",HomeServe
The plumber who resolved my problem was Tarquin. He scored A* all round.He quietly dealt with a devastating situation and resolved my issue.I highly commend him for his professionalism and his manner and skills.He must be highly valued by Homeserve. Thank you.,HomeServe
Sorry you didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help me at all and I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand why do I pay insurance for this? The guy told me that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m only insure for Tap water and no shower . I never had something like this very upset Customer ,HomeServe
"Our query was dealt with swiftly and the plumber was fast, efficient, tidy and friendly ",HomeServe
I was thinking about cancelling my Homeserve Policy as it has increased year on year and I have had it for many years. But then my kitchen tap developed a drip and applied online for them to fix it. I was amazed how quickly they responded to this and fixed it. I now realise for peace of mind it is worth the outlay. Thank you.,HomeServe
Plumber came on time. Did a good job. Easy to book online.,HomeServe
The engineer called and carried out the repair and an inspection on our leaking sink system. We received a report and a copy has been sent to Wren the kitchen installer to claim replacements which are under 5 year guarantee.,HomeServe
Excellent service. Prompt and very efficient. 10 out of 10 for the engineer who fixed the water leakAugust,HomeServe
Very efficient service and professional plumbers who visited me,HomeServe
"Prompt excellent service from your plumbers. The problem was solved the same afternoon.  No stress, no drama, just great service. ",HomeServe
"Thankyou for your recent help with a tricky blocked pipe under my kitchen floor .... my claim was swiftly dealt with online, with clear and quick service offered on two occasions. Both the plumber (day1) and engineer (day2) arrived a tad early and set about their work skilfully, giving good advice on future prevention tactics, and leaving no mess. ",HomeServe
Asked for and received excellent response when we were told we had a leak.  Problem found and dealt with efficiently.  Technician very helpful ,HomeServe
Repaired pipework very wellCame back and retarmac driveway that had been dug up ,HomeServe
"We had a leaky toilet and once we rang them up they were very helpful. The only issue I had was the appointment would be 1week later. However when the plumber arrived he was very courteous, explained what he was going to do once he found the issue and it was sorted very quickly.",HomeServe
The plumber was efficient and worked really well and cleanly.,HomeServe
"Plumber arrived promptly and set to work cutting a hole in the ceiling to help locate the leak.  Sometime later he declared it was a leaking seal from the shower which I would need to get resealed.  I resolved to stop using the shower until it was fixed.  3 days later, on going into the garage I found the situation worse.Entirely wrong diagnosis of the problem which was a leaking cold water feed.",HomeServe
"The engineer was excellent, and I have no complaint about him. But we had to wait for about three days before he came, unable to use the kitchen sink or the washing machine, because we were told our problem ""wasn't an emergency"". Have you ever tried preparing food and doing the washing up in the small bathroom handbowl for three days? In addition, we were told he would come some time between 8.00 a.m. and 6 p.m. (In the end he came around 4.00.) I understand it's not possible to give an exact time, but surely you could at least specify morning or afternoon?",HomeServe
"Suddenly noticed that my back outside drain was overflowing when the tap, dishwasher, etc were in use. I rang Homeserve.  Within less than 24 hours the appointment had been made, the problem identified and the outside drains cleared.  As the actual blockage was at the front, and would have got much worse,  I was very appreciative of the speed and efficiency. Thank you to all the team.",HomeServe
"The engineer didn't make a fuss, got on with the check and was able to confirm no leeks and the water collected was not from or to my home.Very happy",HomeServe
The engineer arrived in the morning which was good. He wouldn't replace the tap as our basin is crazed. He took it apart a d replaced parts. ,HomeServe
After two cancellations the engineer eventually came. He sorted the problem and unblocked  the sink at the same time. The problem with the sink stopper appears to have been rectified and the water is draining freely ,HomeServe
"the actual visit by your Plummer was brilliant, he had the problem sorted in very quick time.we were very pleased he left everything neat and tidy.the main moan I have is the first contact with you ,how can you explain to  a computer what the problem you have is , Apart from telling it you have a leak, then the plumber turns up and says i didn't expect that. can we have the call centre staff back, it's good to talk to someone ,thanks , Peter Pugh  ",HomeServe
Great serviceOur Engineer was able to quickly diagnose the issue that caused the leak and was able to efficiently fix it. Going over and above to make sure the toilet was fitted back correctly as to not have the same issue again. Really friendly and a great service over all. ,HomeServe
I had to make callout due to blocked drain. Someone came out next day to say drain is broken. We had to come out again and fixed it efficiently and kept me informed. Highly recommend,HomeServe
"A recent repair to the flushing system in my bathroom carried out by the Homeserve engineer, who arrived in good time, was speedy supplying the complete system necessary. My only objection is the Ã‚Â£30 I had to pay up front on top of my monthly Homeserve insurance payments. ",HomeServe
Well AJ came and fixed my leak and he was so happy and cheerful and he made absolutely sure everything was ok before he left I would tecomend him definitely he was very careing and helpfull a lovely young man ,HomeServe
First appointment to repair a dripping tap the plumber didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the right tool. The plumber who did was on holiday for a week. I was made an appointment for the following week  8-1. At 12 I received a phone call to say there was a delay and my appointment had to be changed to 12-6pm. The plumber arrived at 5pm. Surely all the plumbers should have the right tools or if someone is on holiday it should be passed on to someone else. It was only a dripping tap. ,HomeServe
"We had to wait 6 days to get a sink unblocked which was, in our opinion, too long. Once the guy came the problem was solved very quickly & efficiently. He was also very friendly & polite.",HomeServe
The initial contact when reviewed was deemed as an emergency and I felt it was treated as such.  The 2 plumbers who came out were efficient and friendly were able any concerns I had and kept me informed at.each stage of the work,HomeServe
Leak from bathroom.The engineer did not rush at his problem solving. He looked at all possible options.He was calm snd professional.He found a leaky bath drain and replaced the whole unit. This was on a Bank Holiday Monday so I was even more impressed with his quiet persona. Certainly a very good job.Very tiny point. He replaced the push bath plug with a simple plug on a chain. I've no problem with this but perhaps he could have told me first that it was not like for like.,HomeServe
"Very courteous on the telephone.  Sent out a plumber very quickly, fixed the leak and the problem was sorted.  Thank you very much.",HomeServe
"The last visit was fine, my toilet leak into the pan was repaired. The previous 2 visits by different plumbers did not cure the leak.",HomeServe
"I explained when I made the call what was the issue with our plumbing!  They sent a plumber who explained that he did not deal with inside the house plumbing and that he thought it was a leak outside the house?  I never said this!!!So he then made a call to get a plumber for 'inside' the house!  He came but could only fix the tap in one of the basins and then said that we should get a plumber???!!!  What is the point of having a contract with Homeserve and paying a huge fee for 2 plumbers to come out and not be able to solve the issue!  In the end we had to call out an independent plumber which is now costing us.  And when I made a call to Homeserve to see if this would affect our policy for the future... I was told - yes, it would and that although we have a contract where we do not pay an excess our policy payment from having called out a plumber will increase substantially next year - great!!!!!  And they never resolved the problem!!!!",HomeServe
"Water leak. Easy to report and book call out online with a Homeserve plumbing and drainage policy. Clear information and simple to arrange.  The leak was worse than first thought so had to call for emergency help. The 24-hour helpline and being able to speak to a person was great. They came out as promised the following morning. The helpful operatives both on the phone and fixing the problem at our home along with clear instructions, good contact and the information given were all 5 star.",HomeServe
"Your plumber Ben ( forgive me if I have the wrong name) turned up soon after his phone call, was neat and tidy, respectful of our property ( taking off his shoes) and set about repairing our cloakroom cistern   flush unit. Unfortunately he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the part he required for the repair which was quite understandably as the unit was as least 20 years old. He left our house and within 30 minutes he was back with the part which he fitted with professional consummate ease explaining  to my wife as he went along with the repair. Before leaving he adjusted some screw within the cistern which made it easier for us to turn off water entering the cistern. A God send. Overall we were very happy with Ben, he was a great Ambassador for Home Serve, he repaired our problem with no fuss and bother. He is welcome to come back if we should having another problem with our waterworks! ",HomeServe
"Plumber was punctual, personable, polite and efficient and did the necessary repair effectively, quickly and with no fuss.",HomeServe

"Good early appointment to sort out the problem, pleasant plumber ",HomeServe
"After the initial appointment was cancelled due to a emergency else where, which was a inconvenience as I had , had to take time off work and then take another day off the next day as I had been rebooked in for the following day. So things werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking good for HomeServe. However the plumber that did come was polite and did above and beyond to sort my problem out. I would give 10 out of 10 for the plumber.",HomeServe
"Don't trust this company, some time ago we had a problem with leaking heating pipes. Work for 5-6 days, they hung around for three months (if someone doesn't believe me, I can send them photos). Different ""specialists"" came every day, hung around  for 3-4 hours and they tell me ""another colleague will come tomorrow"" and so on for more than two months. In the end, they replaced two meters of pipe (the living room and the bedroom were dug up during that time) without putting a protector on the pipes, they poured concrete from above. Everyone  a normal person knows that at temperature copper pipes expand and then shrink, this means that the concrete will break through the pipes (but apparently the ""specialists"" either don't know, or they do it on purpose).Run away from this company, now! 2020 year",HomeServe
The engineer did a thorough job to repair the failed flush system and spent time to fetch required parts to complete the job. Moreover he explained the issues in more depth and when more and above to replace the cistern with an internal flush.,HomeServe
First plumber did not do a good job but the second one sorted it all. Thank you ,HomeServe
"We had a plumbing issue, made a call and the same day had a competent, pleasant plumber who fixed it.  No additional costs beyond the contracted deal.  Initial call was answered by a robot - but handed to an agent quickly.",HomeServe
"The two chaps had the odious task of finding a leaking mains pipe they worked brilliantly all day to complete the task and left my drive in perfect condition. The collection of the spoils was arranged for a later collection by a designated company was only spoiled by the guy needing a cash payment to take away two bags which were more than on his work sheet , I refused to pay so he left me the two heaviest bags to remove myself, which as an eighty year old was a little taxing. It spoilt in a way a job which was superbly carried out by yourselves.",HomeServe
I was worried when I thought I had a bathroom leak. It transpired that it was not but your engineer had no problem with being called out to a non event. He was understanding and polite which meant a lot to this 85 year old. Thank you.PS. Date of experience is approximate.Ã¢ÂÂ¸,HomeServe

"We had a leak on the waste pipework on the shower, causing water to drip through the ceiling of the sitting room, below the shower cubicle waste.  HomeServe arranged a visit quickly and efficiently.  The engineer who came was very polite and helpful, but was not able to rectify the leak because he could not reach the waste pipework from under the plastic shower tray.  He recommended removing the plastic tray and replacing it with a ceramic tray, which is what I now have to arrange.",HomeServe
Quick response to our request for help. The engineer was knowledgeable and went to some lengths to explainethproblem and how he would tackle it using a drain camera nd other equipment:  A successful job well done by a friendly engineer ,HomeServe
The plumber rang and turned up on time. Fixed the problem with no problems had parts on the van and was very pleasant. ,HomeServe
"Having to talk to a bot on the phone made it impossible to explain properly what the problem was. So I was shocked and dismayed that, having phoned on the Friday, nothing could be done until the following Tuesday because of the Bank Holiday. The problem was  finally solved on the Thursday, ie 6 days later. The plumbers who came were polite and helpful but having to clear the space so that they could get to problem, three times and then putting it all back, wasn't good for me at 81 and with serious back problems.",HomeServe

Had cause to call out 2 plumbers on separate days recently. On both occasions they came within the time frames specified and completed the jobs satisfactorily.

The   technician quickly identified the problem but did not have the necessary part available; an appointment was made for the following day when a further technician arrived at the time notified at the first visit.

"The plumber was as helpful as can be but I should have cancelled or rather altered the order as although I had said Ã¢â‚¬Å“leak to thermostatic showerÃ¢â‚¬Â I was not covered for this. But I do in fact have two other slightly leaking taps. So I regard it as wasted my time, his time and my money. I think the lack of flexibility, the fact that there is only one job per call out allowed , and automatic speech is greatly to the detriment of this service. I intend to cancel.",HomeServe

Next I hear is text from plumbers company asking me to send a photo of the tap to make sure they ordered the correct part ???. To date no new cartridge fitted.Then I receive a request to rate my experience. While the tap is better than it was I can see it is already starting to have the same original issue again.,HomeServe

Just an update to my original review. I had a call today and the company decided that they will come and rectify the problem. Told me they will come between 12-6 today. But at 1520 I get a call stating the plumber will not be able to attend today. They expect me to make myself available tomorrow. Which is not looking possible as I am not in the area. So day 3 wasted with this company. I will update you on if this issue gets resolved. ,HomeServe
"I've had the company out a number of times to look at blocked drains and they have tracked the problem down, taking out debris and eventually putting a sleeve in to seal the drain.  The guys doing the job have been great.  Good communicators and very nice to deal with.  The only slight niggle has been a series of cancellations, but to be honest they have always rebooked and turned up as advised. Good personal service",HomeServe

The issue was fixed that day. ,HomeServe
Leak was sorted out ,HomeServe
"Man was helpful , however was not able to clear drain",HomeServe
The repair required should have been straightforward - fix a leak from the water supply to the washing machine. This turned out to be not only that but a leak from the pipe supplying the outdoor tap. Neither of the leaks were easily accessible and it took the engineer much longer that expected. His perseverance was greatly appreciated in getting this resolved,HomeServe
"charged us for work they didn't do. engineer said tap was not of a make they could fix and that he would submit this fact in his report. obviously made no difference to Homeserve. will not be renewing membership.Then I get a reply from Homeserve following my review to say that they advise me to contact the manufacturer of the tap. No mention of returning my Ã‚Â£30 which I paid for them not doing anything but tell me they couldn't fix it. Based on the 2 minutes it took to walk into the house, look at the brand of the tap and walk out again, that works out at Ã‚Â£900 per hour. Daylight robbery.Two weeks later - still say they're sorry about my ex[serience - but clearly not sorry enough to return my Ã‚Â£30",HomeServe
I had an appointment booked for a Sunday (leaking sink) and had made arrangements around this. I received a call about an hour before to say the engineer was off sick and wouldn't be coming and the appointment was rescheduled for the monday (which I could not do). It would have been good to have been notified earlier in the morning so that we could re-arrange out plans for that day (so more notice of cancewould have helped). I managed to rearrange for the following week and the engineer came and sorted it out.,HomeServe
"The Man who came was friendly and courteous, he replaced our leaking tap with a very similar tap. Job done",HomeServe
"Quick to respond, set time for same day visit. Fixed leak and prevented ceiling coming down promptly. Friendly and efficient technician that came out. CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fault this experience ",HomeServe
Service was very good. Had drippy taps.. very easy to book appointments that suits you. Very reliable. Highly recommended ,HomeServe
"My toilet handle broke. The Homeserve engineer fitted a new one, which was better than the old one. Excellent service from Homeserve.",HomeServe
Unfortunately everything went wrong. We had a flood through the ceiling. The tap does not fit properly. We now awaiting a plumber again to fix it and secure the tap. Tap hose is to close to the back of basin and water runs all over the back when you open tap and use it. ,HomeServe
"The engineer was extremely helpful, he was determined to get to the root of the problem, for the first time my toilet drain is working perfectly. ",HomeServe
Ultimately a blocked toilet was fixed by Homeserve after forgetting I had the cover I had called out an emergency drainage company who didn't fix it.The fix did take three attempts but all who attended were friendly and explained the situation. ,HomeServe
"The plumber arrived as scheduled and did a quick check n adjusted some pipes. And mentioned the leak is rectified. However, after two weeks, the same leaking occurred. We have called Homeserve to send a plumber to fix. ",HomeServe
Able to speak to a human being promptly on a Sunday afternoon to report a water leak. Inspection of problem quickly thereafter. All booked in for repairs which were completed professionally and on time. Homeserve is an excellent example of how other service providers should perform ,HomeServe
"I contacted HomeServe as I was experiencing bad odours in the home thought to be coming from the drain. After making an appointment, a gentleman came round to my property. The gentleman didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give the impression he was very interested. He lifted the manhole cover up outside briefly then had a look down the plug hole in our shower, coming to the conclusion it was probably a partially blocked plug hole. He was gone in less than ten minutes.",HomeServe
"A very good experience - Contacting to make claim was easy - Surveyor came out was pleasant and found the location of underground leak - Engineer that arrived was great, dug up direct where leak was and fixed in short time, tidied up and was a very nice chap - My first claim and i was honestly surprised how good it went.",HomeServe
"Booking the appointment was easy and the plumber came on time, was very polite and helpful and arranged a follow-up visit with all the necessary parts for the job. Now the toilet works perfectly. ",HomeServe
Good communication from the operator. He called before attending and we didn't have to wait too long. He was very polite and did a great job repairing our toilet.,HomeServe
"Excellent service. Came out the same day. Sorted the problem swiftly. Very nice, pleasant staff from initial telephone enquiry to gentleman who came put to fix my plumbing problem. Replaced the faulty tap, which was also covered by the insurance. Very impressed.",HomeServe
Came as promised fixed the problem went away. New tap fitted problem resolved. Thanks. ,HomeServe
"drain cleared successfully in about 30 seconds. I was a bit disappointed to have to pay an excess though as hadn't had to in a previous claim. Overall , a good service. Thank you.",HomeServe
"My toilet was not flushing properly. I called HomeServe UK and the problem was rectified within the agreed timescale. I received a telephone call from the plumber on the day that that the cistern was repaired. The cistern was repaired within thirty minutes, HomeServe is an excellent service, which I would recommend without hesitation.",HomeServe
"Homeserve discovered that we had 2 holes in our water pipe. Despite both leaks being very close to one another we were told that we had to make a second insurance claim for the second leak which seemed surprising to us.As the leaking water pipe was shared with our neighbours who also had Homeserve cover, they made the second insurance claim on their policy which seemed fair under the circumstances.  Both leaks could be accessed from the same hole which then had to be dug twice for the second claim and this work was undertaken 2 weeks after the first claim. This therefore lengthened the whole process which had to be dealt with urgently as both ourselves and our neighbours had been served with a section 75 notice by Severn Trent Water Authority. Both leaks were mended and we were ultimately happy with the work done but not the time delay which could have been avoided if both leaks had been repaired on the first visit.",HomeServe
"Can't give a review because you never done anything.Sent a plumber to sort the toilet, couldn't do it. Suggested changing the toilet (but didn't know if HOMESERVE would!!).Filled out a Customer First Form, even stating a Vulnerable person needed the toilet (86yrs old with Alzheimers).Still waiting for an answer.Phoned up to chase, the guy on the phone had never heard of the form and said on his system the job was complete!!!Still got the same problem, as well as the stink from the drains because of the Trap Seal, and got charged for claim although nothing actually got or has been done.Really bad communication and service ",HomeServe
Very efficient resolved issue. Plumber had visited previously so was aware of the problems.,HomeServe
"Dreadful, second visit for the same problem.  First guy diagnosed the problem, said he would report it in, nothing happened, i had to raise the issue again.  Second guy agreed with the first but didnt have the part, went away and still nothing fixed, nothing logged and i am left chasing and being requested to pay another excess.",HomeServe
"I have to give 5 stars to HomeServe as they have been absolutely fantastic with all their services . I have. Gas,electric and drainage cover all amazing services I had amazing people come to do my drains and they really took care of the work with a personal touch Even the colleagues I spokeTo on the phone went out of their way to resolve my issues I wish I could name them personally but I know some names of the colleagues who have been out and over the phone 2x   Chris from electrics , Caroline from customer service arranged scaffolding over the weekend whiz was again almost undoable . The drainage boys were sent agai for the same job to allow for continuity .  Not only is the service good they have the skill and knowledge to complete a job with support from the team if anything did go wrong ",HomeServe
Excellent service by operatives once they arrived but slow response - we were without water entirely for 36 hours. ,HomeServe
Paid a Ã‚Â£70 excess for a repair that took less than 5 minutes and involved effectively gluing the tap handle on. Poor value for money.,HomeServe
"Plumber was brilliant, ai booking was rubbish. I had said that I had 2 problems but the plumber had only been told about one, luckily both were only small and he was able to fix both very quickly ",HomeServe
"My tap was replaced with one of inferior quality. The plumber said he didn't have the parts to repair it. He asked if I could dispose left the rubbish, however he took the old tap away without asking , I phoned him asking him to return it, he said he it would but has not done. I feel very disappointed with his devious. behaviour ",HomeServe
"Excellent service, easy to organise an appointment, engineer was prompt and friendly, hassle free! Just what you need when you have a leak! ",HomeServe
"Clear, simple, quick process. Called with a leak on internal stop tap on a Sunday Morning. Could not believe that they had it fixed within a few hours. The engineer rang us en route and advised time of arrival, even stating, Ã¢â‚¬ËœdonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have it sorted out in no time!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢And he did! Amazing!",HomeServe
"The 2 operators I spoke to were very helpful & polite .my problem was dealt with very quickly. The engineer who attended was lovely , diagnosed the problem quickly ordered part & returned next day with the part & carried out repair .",HomeServe

The plumber came and fixed my sink very quickly,HomeServe
"Plumber was  covering his shoe before  he  enter the house .Done the job, explained  what was wrong. And polite.",HomeServe
Very helpful plumber. Gave good advice  and checked for problems. Quite a while ago had drain blocked and had amazing service  in difficult circumstances.  Even took photos to help if problems in future. ,HomeServe
Top man who came to us soon sorted out where the underground leak was ,HomeServe
The plumber arrived on time and did a thorough job replacing the faulty parts. He also pointed out some things that were not installed correctly. Just a pity that took 8 days to get an appointment,HomeServe
The leak wasn't resolved on the first visit but quickly fixed and resolved the same day on the 2nd visit. Thank you ,HomeServe
Your employee was so helpful. He fitted a new tap which solved all of our problems.He was polite and courteous. We couldn't have asked for better service,HomeServe

"Aaron arrived in Acton this afternoon, in the time frame given the night before,Aaron task was to rebuild my toilet with new part, his skill was fantastic,!Thanks again Aaron, a true credit to HomeServe, ",HomeServe
"A water leak in the bathroom meant going online to HomeServe and finding, to my joy, appointments available that same day. I booked it, and a plumber arrived an hour later. Polite and helpful, he diagnosed the issue quickly and put everything right expertly. It was a good experience for us from start to finish.",HomeServe
"We asked for a visit for a leaking toilet waste pipe. When the Engineer arrived he identified the problem as being a poor connection from the cistern - he made good the connection, tested it and explained what he had done! No further problem - very well satisfied!",HomeServe
"We had a problem with our toilet waste going into our septic tank. Very efficient service, excellent operator that came out to us . Our problem was a well know brand of 3ply toilet roll that does not dissolve.. we have since changed our brand .",HomeServe
"I would like to say thank to Alfie for the amazing job he did with our water leak,  following the job through to the end and always notifying us of what was happening.  ",HomeServe
"Professional, polite and excellent service as per usual by a very kind young plumber. Many thanks!",HomeServe
The plumber was excellent. The problem is that a 5 hour slot is allocated to you and you are told after 4.5 hours that he is unable to keep the appointment. This happened 3 times to me. I understand that unexpected work happens but surely I could have been informed a lot earlier.,HomeServe
Very good service. The plumber who came was friendly and efficient. Only criticism is we had to wait about 5 days for the appointment.,HomeServe
"We had blocked drain Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.. not pleasant! Booked an appt. Saturday and had an engineer Sunday morning. Very nice gentleman came, polite, friendly let us know he was on his way and dealt with the problem quickly and efficiently. Excellent service Thankyou.",HomeServe
Easy to book appointment. Great appointment availability. Superb communication throughout. Skilled and friendly plumbers. Repair was quickly sorted and all mess was cleaned up. ,HomeServe
"Disappointing that there was a four day wait for a relatively urgent issue to be dealt with and that the appointment system was fully automated. However, the service provided by the plumber was excellent and the issue resolved.",HomeServe
"Still awaiting report!.  Plumber arrived on time, but blockage in lavatory had cleared by then. However a promised report and action to prevent further blockages has never been sent after three weeks ",HomeServe
Came out reasonably fast had the toilet Ã°Å¸ÂªÂ  cleared in no time thanks ,HomeServe
"I reported my water leak via an AI voice over the phone which didn't record the details fully, so ended up wasting both the engineers time and my time. Homeserve refunded my excess payment, but the drive for efficiency failed here. A person, rather than an AI voice, would have picked up on the details, and left me feeling like I'd be listened to. ",HomeServe
"The home serve plumber was fantastic, really happy so smart in appearance, very efficient with his work , thank you Homeserve",HomeServe
The engineer worked very hard to free the blockage from my drain. He persevered until he was able to climb down into drain and remove tree roots by hand.  Not a pleasant job.,HomeServe
"Well what can say, the service was extremely easy to handle from phoning up telling them our issue to the engineer that came out.The moment the young man came through our door we knew we would get first class service from him, he talked us through as to what the problem was and how he was going to fix it, he is a real credit to the company he works for, l know l canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t name him but l hope his office after reading this give him a well deserved pat on the back.As an older couple you never know whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming through your door, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had a couple of cowboys pass by and proved us right, more Bodge up and Leggit  rather what we received via home serve, l will certainly continue with this service, a thanks from us to home service and a massive one to the young plumber. ",HomeServe
"I had a leak on my toilet, the man came out to fix it, promptly and on time, but 2 days later the same problem had occurred, i have only just come back off holiday so couldn't arrange another appointment until now, but i feel i am paying another Ã‚Â£30 when the problem wasn't really fixed.",HomeServe
Guys who fixed the Kitchen Tap leak were competent and very pleased that they sorted out properly and professionally.,HomeServe
"A muddle trying to book with the answer phone saying one thing. It was not booked in but a staff member phoned said it was not booked in so gave me an appointment. Then due to the plumber coming another phone call was told due to being held up in a job ,given another appointment later in the day. When a plumber arrived he was extremely nice man did an excellent job , canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t praise him enough.",HomeServe
Lovely friendly guy replaced old dripping  tap which I supplied. Very tidy and efficient.,HomeServe
"An excellent engineer turned up in the time allocated on a Sunday evening, carried out the work on correcting the dripping bath taps and spent all the time focusing on the repair. I can not fault his application to the task and once again highly recommend HomeServe for their first class service.",HomeServe
The person from homeserve was very professional and the leak has been rectified.,HomeServe
I rang with a waste water flood on Friday evening and the Plumbing Engineer came 9.00am Saturday morning. He identified the waste pipe routing and cleared the problem. I was happy with both the call process and the response I got from them.,HomeServe
The plumber was pleasant and professional and efficient in dealing with the problem ,HomeServe
"Arrived quickly after first call, assessd problem, returned quickly to locate and repair leak, polite and helpful operatives.",HomeServe

"1st call to fix problem with tap leak lasted a week,called out again prompt response and problem fixed.",HomeServe
The plumber did a good job. Only downside is the waiting time for someone to attend fault.,HomeServe
"When the Homeserve plumber arrived I showed him where in the bathroom the possible areas where the leak might be. He found the leak in a matter of minutes, even though it was hidden from view, and fixed it immediately. Grateful for him doing that.",HomeServe
Very quick to repair toilet blockage ,HomeServe
"Leak under the bathroom sink was fixed the same day. The service was excellent, the engineer was friendly and efficient. I was pleasantly surprised with how fast HomeServe could attend and it gave me peace of mind knowing I have a policy.",HomeServe

Plumber very helpful and efficient.  Process worked well but not keen on the automated telephone system.,HomeServe
Nothing was to much.. second time the homeserve engineer has been out in 4 wks.. for two different jobs. Sorted the pipes both times. Arrived prompt after having a phone call to let me know he was on his way. Rang in the afternoon and homeserve attended the next morning.. on both occasions. ,HomeServe

As soon as plumber checked tap he had good idea of fault replaced part of tap inners and all was resolved,HomeServe
Experience very good. Knowledgeable plumber.  Punctual. No mess. Problem solved.,HomeServe
The guy who came did a fine thorough job . The house drains are flowing perfectly. Quick and effective. ,HomeServe
I did not like the fact that it took three visits for the leak under the tap of my kitchen to be fixed. Especially the first engineer did not provide the proper focus. I pay a monthly fee for HomeServe plus for every visit they charge Ã‚Â£30. That means a certain amount of professionalism is expected by HomeServe.,HomeServe
"Ben your plumber was great, very professional, knowledgable and efficient. Job was sorted quickly without any fuss. Excellent !",HomeServe
I phoned Homeserve as we had an issue with our bath tap. I got a quick appointment for their engineer who came promptly and replaced the tap for us. Very polite and efficient. Much appreciated.,HomeServe
"This time the wait for the work to be done was an unacceptable 2weeks for a mains leak . However the work was completed and was, as usual, a very high standard . Nothing is too much !! ",HomeServe
It was my first experience with Homeserve and was really greatThe App was easy to use and the guy who came to fix the leakage did a perfect jobReally happy with this experience ,HomeServe
"Had to come back twice to fix same leak, said it was fixed the first time but water board told me it was still leaking, second man fixed it.",HomeServe
"The initial contact was good but had a 2 day wait for a leaking pipe, then I was called 5 minutes before the arrival deadline to be told I would have yet another 2 days wait. Terrible comms. When they plumber arrived he did a good job. ",HomeServe
"The engineer saw the fault immediately replaced the old pipe , he worked cleanly and professionally ",HomeServe
The engineer was competent and polite. He fixed the leak but I later discovered that replacement of the toilet is slightly out of position and the toilet lid is affected. Restoration work has been arranged privately and will solve the issue .,HomeServe
"Phone answered fairly quickly,did not like to wait a week for a visit from the plumbers when they called they were polite and efficient top job by them!",HomeServe
Easy booking of the service and the plumber that visited to complete the work was super friendly and sorted out the problem immediately. Very happy with the experience and outcome. Thanks.,HomeServe
"We had a great experience from start to finish. The people on the end of the phone brilliant, and the plumber who came out to visit us did a great job.",HomeServe
"I wish I could speak to a real person to explain what the problem was, because twice I had to call out plumber and the problem wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fixed. Each time I had to pay Ã‚Â£30 excess. ",HomeServe
Your workman found the fault causing the leak straight away which another didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t and my house insurance wanted Ã‚Â£350 plus anther Ã‚Â£150 to come and track and traceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ to replace a washer,HomeServe
Ben who visited me to fix a broken tap was nothing but caring and professional. He was so kind and sorted the problem very quickly. ,HomeServe
House of 5 all disabled who rely on a shower. Shower packed in so called Homeserve as I have cover with them. Was informed the shower they would fit and when. Plumber came on date an to time yet could not fit shower and the electric cabling was on the wrong side of shower. Was then informed they would send me a cheque for Ã‚Â£200 for myself to purchase a new shower AND have it fitted. So the fact you have paid for the service yet told to buy your own shower and it plumbing in is totally unacceptable especially when it leaves 5 disabled people without bathing facilities and still having to wait 10 working days for the cheque to arrive. SO in the meantime we have to find the money to purchase a new shower and try find a plumber free to do the job...... Disgusting treatment of customers disabled or not,HomeServe
"There were no slots for the day I chose so someone was supposed to be calling me within 24 hours  - nobody did. I opted to go on the chat and found that stressful. On the day, the engineer/plumber was brilliant though.",HomeServe
Nothing was fixed. I will call a local plumber.,HomeServe
The plumber was unfriendly and not very helpful.,HomeServe
"This was a great all round service from Homeserve. It was easy to book a callout with immediate appointments available. I was kept fully updated om arrival of the engineer. The engineer was great, I thought it was a blocked drain but it was in fact the sewer pipe that had a blockage. He quickly got to work and sorted the problem which was some plant roots blocking the drain. All was left tidy with advice given on the manhole cover. The excess to pay was just Ã‚Â£30 and I was delighted with the service and will certainly recommend Homeserve to friends, which I have already done. Thank you very much",HomeServe
"Very professional, Ã‚Â£30 two taps changed, job done",HomeServe
"Excellent service , top quality plumbers who turn up on time and get the job done with a minimum of fuss ",HomeServe
The whole thing was very good. Call out to fixing NEW TAP.PLUMBER JOSH VERY GOOD.,HomeServe
Engineers could not fix problem which was broken nut on sink pop up waste.Nice enough lads.Paying for this service monthly I thought your experienced engineers would be able to solve our problem.We took the part to a plumbers shop  bought the nut and fixed it ourselves.Very disappointed with your service.,HomeServe
I was given an appointment for the following day. The plumber arrived on time and completed the repair in good time. I cannot think of any way to improve the service.,HomeServe
Plumber was prompt and solved the problem withminimum delay,HomeServe
"It was a great experience from start to finish. Bdadi was the engineer who  ame to resolve the pipe leak and he was great. Professional, empathetic and understanding. Great example of how customer service is all about. Thanks a lot guys for your help.",HomeServe
"We had a good chat with the engineer (John).. What was interesting was that he said as we had 3 toilets on our property our cover was restricted. Unfortunately the source issue could not be detected, no fault of the engineer. However it did raise a concern thatat no time have we been asked how many toilets do we have on our property. But it would seem Homeserve only cover one.",HomeServe
"Very nice young man,  very polite  and friendly,  had a look at tap ,decided it needed replacing,  new one fitted,  works perfectly,  well done ...thank you",HomeServe
Guy came on time honest did his best but too many exclusions. They should have basic plumbing parts on board and replace a blockage. I had to pay someone else to do a ten minute job. ,HomeServe
"All engineers were courteous, friendly and thorough, carrying out necessary checks before proceeding with repairing a leak, which was done quickly.",HomeServe
"Quick response, excellent plumber.  I was able to get an appointment with a plumber on the day that the issue of my leaking sink drain and overflow was identified that Saturday morning by the water filter engineer.  The Homeserve engineer was great.  He rang me to let me know that he was on route, he explained what he was doing and he smiled all the time (even my nervous dog liked him) and he did the job swiftly and with style.",HomeServe
"I have an on going problem with my mains water pipe, its leaking frequently, they are always here next day to repair it. (5 times in the last couple of years) its now being replaced totally, I cannot praise them enough.",HomeServe

"Horrific experience! If I could give this 1 star I would. Had a leak in bathroom. Engineer came and couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remove bath panel to check underneath, so made us sign a disclaimer in case there was damage to the panel, which I did. Then he proceeded to hack into the bath tub itself with a sharp tool, destroying my bath and the panel underneath. Had to pay Ã‚Â£250 to get someone to repair the bath tub. The engineer said it was defective sealant. We have had all the sealant redone and now the leak is still there so I have spent hundreds of pounds, have no legal redress against Homeserve and the leak is still present. So upset. Had caused me much distress let alone the financial loss. ",HomeServe
"I've had to use Homeserve a few times this year with plumbing issues, and each time have received practical, honest advice and a genuinely helpful manner from each plumber who's come. If an additional visit was needed to (for example) fit a new part that had to be ordered, it was managed quickly and with the same plumber who started the job coming to finish it. ",HomeServe
No.problem booking and sorted my tap out,HomeServe
"One phone call to Homeserve, tell them what the problem is and leave it in their more than capable hands.The plumber arrived when he was expected, kept me up to date exactly when he going to arrive.  The job was carried out efficiently and he was most courteous.",HomeServe
"Very polite engineer arrived soon after my slot time started, very knowledgeable fixed the faulty tap in no time at all, most impressed with the service he gave ",HomeServe
"The response was speedy and we were kept informed of rough time of arrival. The chap arrived at 22.00 and, with the aid of a torch on his headgear and some degree of grit and determination, overcame a large pile of logs to get to the outside tap that was the source of the problem. The problem was quickly and efficiently addressed and, within 15 minutes, a new tap had been installed and we  were sorted. And before the operative arrived we were advised what to do to minimise the problem",HomeServe
"The engineer that called to the emergency plumbing failed to tighten a valve from the main feed to the toilet cistern causing a leak therefore causing damage to my kitchen ceiling cupboards behind the boiler and wet plaster, the cupboard around the boiler and a lower cupboard beneath the boiler that is situated beneath the upstairs toilet. The floor is also wet and the kitchen continuously smells damp. I was instructed by you to contact my buildings insurance to resolve the situation.This also resulted in me having to call an emergency Plummer because you were unable to send anyone until the following afternoon. The emergency Plummer isolated the source of the leak and charged me Ã‚Â£125. I was instructed to contact my buildings insurance to make a claim. I was informed by yourselves that an engineer would call between 5 pm and 10 pm however your engineer called me at 20.52pm asking if he could book me in for the morning for the repair to be done because he was two hours away from the property. I explained I had been let down previously by another engineer that day and would like this matter resolved tonight. Your engineer arrived at 22.50 he was very hostile his tone was abrupt and I felt he was not professional in his manner. He did repair the problem with the flush on the toilet however six days later we noted a wet ceiling in the kitchen and damage to my plaster around the boiler and lower cupboards and kitchen floor. My insurance company will be in touch with you as the excess is Ã‚Â£200 and has caused me an incredible amount of stress having to send electronic images of the damage to them to complete their assessment.Please do not hesitate to contact me further if you require any additional information. I have raised a complaint with your company regarding this matter.Kind regardsMrs Barton",HomeServe
"Easy to use automated service, plumber arrived the next day, called when he was 30 minutes away. Job completed very well ",HomeServe
Ok no problems Engineer used the toilet and did not flush it !,HomeServe
"Called Homeserve Saturday evening, the technician arrived just before 8:00am Monday morning. She cleared the blockage in no time, was polite and courteous. ",HomeServe
My appointment was rearranged FOUR times BY Homeserve before an engineer came after I complained at the extreme inconvenience caused and my leak not being fixed as arranged for by the service I pay for monthly! I complained at the extreme inconvenience caused waiting in all morning/afternoon and with water leaking into a container which had to be emptied frequently to avoid damage to my property! I was going to cancel the agreement for a service that I was not getting becuase it is totally unacceptable to rearrange that many times. The engineer that did then come sorted the leak very efficiently and I cannot fault his work but it is a great shame that I had to be inconvenienced 4 times and complain before an engineer came to fix it.,HomeServe
"An engineer came out to assess tap. Told me it needed replacing so we chose an alternative one and he said it would be ordered. He was from SES?/SCS.A week later second chap arrived with no knowledge of problem apart Ã¢â‚¬Å“unfinished jobÃ¢â‚¬Â! However he was excellent and even had a tap in his van , not the one IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d chosen, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine. He was from Homeserve itself and seemed more knowledgable. ",HomeServe
Very professional plumber. He was determined to do a proper job and very friendly.,HomeServe
The plumbers that came were very efficient and did a good job but there is definitely a lack of communication. We needed a new part for our tap which the first plumber didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have on his van so he said that another plumber would come out and he booked the appointment but when the second plumber came he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what he was there to fix and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the part on his van! So another appointment was made and the part was ordered and it was finally fixed. ,HomeServe
"Very pleased with the service provided by Home Serve , was easy to book the appointment , the plumber rang to let us know his arrival time which was very helpfull , very nice chap sorry i forget his name , he manage to sort our problem out , would recommend this service .",HomeServe

Good communication. Sorted tap but could not sort the second job. Dripping pipe outside. It is still dripping!,HomeServe
"The plumbers that came decided to change the tap, which is situated outside in the back garden and had seized up and they installed a new one.They were very efficient and I was pleased with the work they carried out.Best wishes, Mrs. Pauline Rumsey.",HomeServe
Thank you for a quick response and turnaround in respect of our leaking pipe in the kitchen. Saved us a big expense .,HomeServe
All the staff have been excellent trying to find our leak. They did and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now repaired.Thank you so much ,HomeServe
"I recently called on Homeserve to eliminate my dripping taps in the bathroom. I booked online. I naively assumed as both bathroom and basin taps were leaking it was one job and one call out. When the plumber arrived, he immediately said that he would only do the basin or the bath and not both and that I should have booked via the call centre and not online. Hmm Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ so now the online booking system is flawed then? He also immediately told me that I would need a new tap and then corrected that to a new cartridge. He disappeared off in his van and came back and told me heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d advised the office to order the part. He wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t at all pleasant and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t represent Homeserve in a good light. I then had a call the following day to be told that the tap (only 5 years old) was now obsolete and parts are unobtainable. My choice was to either have Homeserve install a tap of their choosing (even though it matched the bath taps) or to buy my own and have them fit it. I asked if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d make a contribution to the tap I would buy and they refused. So I reluctantly purchased my own tap which was very similar in appearance to the old one. The plumber came and fitted that at a later date without issue. Having then booked another job for the bath taps, 2 plumbers arrived and accessed the cartridges and replaced them. However, the taps now donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t close at 180 degrees so look a little odd when closed but the plumber told me that was the best he could do. He also added that should I need to replace the taps, the bath panel would have to come off and that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to sign a disclaimer for any damage. Do self employed plumbers behave like this - I think not. It feels like Homeserve have employed those that could not sustain their own business - if the 4 plumbers who came to the house, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d not want 2 of them back. There appears to be a complete disconnect however - the plumbers  appear empowered to behave the way they do. The customer service training needs a lot more work, as clearly a number of the plumbers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to be accountable to anyone. I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be renewing my annual policy.",HomeServe
The telephonist made arranging the repair very straightforward. The plumber arrived promptly and changed my tap for a new one. He didn't make any mess and got the job done quickly and efficiently.,HomeServe
The guys finding & fixing the leaking underground water pipe were friendly and efficient quickly digging down and finding the leak. This was fixed and the soil and slabs replaced leaving everything back the way it was.,HomeServe
Your engineer was flexible and made sure he fixed our leak despite not having the exact part,HomeServe
"Took a few visits, but they found and dealt with the leak, which involved breaking through a concrete floor within the house. Would have likely cost thousands without this cover so worth every penny. As it's an old pipe system I'll certainly keep paying it while we're here.",HomeServe
"Homeserve were brilliant!  After dealing with a large leak for us a few months ago, one of the kitchen taps also started dripping!  The Homeserve plumber arrived within one day and replaced the tap straightaway.  We were very happy - and relieved - and are very grateful for the service we received.  Thank you!",HomeServe
my solution of a tap was completed in a good time scale but do taps drip after they are turned completely off . the chap said there are no washers in these taps you recommend ,HomeServe
We had planned visit the Saturday 8-1 Heard nothing rang Homeserve at 2 pm no one coming Call centre very blase I have elderly parents had to move plans the Saturday to be home for plumber HomeserveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finally came out the Sunday to dirt the leak ,HomeServe
"The whole process from the online appointment booking to the repair of an underground leak was simple, easy and very professional. The cost you pay is easily worth the peace of mind of having Homeserve available if a plumbing or drainage problem occurs and the service you receive is fantastic. So glad I took out the cover.",HomeServe
Plumber arrived on time and quickly identified the problem. Extremely pleasant and helpful chap.,HomeServe
Paul and Bobby were great. They worked efficiently and did a great job. My drain is running. Better than ever.,HomeServe
Nicky in the office was great.  She organised everything really well and was very efficient.   My plumbing problems are fixed! ,HomeServe
Fast service plumber was out within an hour ,HomeServe
"Well thr Engineer came in pouring rain and worked to repair my leak without even having a hot drink which I offered.  Leak complete, thank you.",HomeServe
When I contacted you the plumber was here the next day he spotted the problem straight away.so I left him to it. He was quick in fixing the problem he was clean and left my bathroom clean there was nothing to show that there was a plumber here .thank you Mr C M.  ,HomeServe
Dave from Homeserve was great. Did a fantastic job with my outside drain. Job was completed within 30 minutes. ,HomeServe
"I was asked when booking what was wrong plumbing etc then toliet, taps etcI paid Ã‚Â£30 excess which i cannot afford but obviously that is the way it is, the engineer came out and although he was very lovely and appologetic said you don't fix taps in showers just electric ones, maybe this should have been asked or stated in the checklist when booking the engineer,i feel that I have wasted Ã‚Â£30 ",HomeServe
The initial call to have someone come out and look at a leak that was coming through the kitchen ceiling was challenging.  Staff member seemed to be ill informed about what the company should do. Plumber / Engineer that came out initially guessed what might be wrong. My husband had to show him what the problem might be to get a correct diagnosis.  ,HomeServe
Plumber came to do the job and he was friendly professional and did his job well in downstair toilet.,HomeServe
"My first claim contact with Homeserve and I am very impressed with the response and professionalism which my case was dealt with. The claim was very simple online and within minutes had booked a convenient time for the plumber to attend. I was pleasantly surprised that the plumber was actually Homeserve employee and not a sub contractor, he dealt with the issue of blocked drains in a quick, clean manner and had the issue resolved within 30mins. All told I am pleased to have taken cover with Homeserve.",HomeServe
"The plumber that came to do the repair was very helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable done that extra wee bit to make sure it wouldn't happen again. ",HomeServe
"They arrived on time, very polite, explained what they doing, found the leak and mended it very quick, left the garden as they found it. Would recommend Home Serve Helen Lloyd",HomeServe
"Although we rang on Sunday morning, the call was answered quickly and an appointment made for the next day. The plumber arrived on time and dealt quickly with the problem. A second visit also was very prompt and checked the drain with a camera to check everything was fine. Very pleased with the service.",HomeServe
When my toilet system refused to stop flushing I panicked but then remembered I had Home Serve for plumbing . I just contacted them and they were very helpful . They offered me an appointment that same afternoon. As I was taking friends out to lunch who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t drive I felt I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let them down. If it had been just me I would have cancelled but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like to let them down . Sure enough the next morning by 10-am it was all sorted. Lovely young man. Very respectful covered his shoes with protective covers and was very polite ,HomeServe
When the engineer got to my home I was told that the tap was a shower and was not covered so no work was done. The engineer was great but the most annoying thing was I had to chase for my call out fee to be refunded and at first was told I could not have it back. I then said I would cancel the policy if that was the case. My money was returned but I should not have had to chase for it. ,HomeServe
Really helpful advice and guidance from your experienced plumber. ,HomeServe
"Thank you so much. Had the most excellent experience and so appreciated helping solve a leak and great customer service and response from the engineer. Thank you, Michaela",HomeServe
Plumber was cheerful & professional -phoned to say he`d be along in 20 minutes- solved the problem with a degree of expertise & even the still leaking mend was solved quickly!,HomeServe
After 3 visits you were unable to clear the toilet blockage. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m planning to fix it myself but waiting for tools to do the job. Ã‚Â£500 / year and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left to me to fix the problem.,HomeServe
HomeServe has been a great help to identify the root cause for the leak in our main. Really pleased with the due diligence.,HomeServe
"The plumber was punctual, friendly, helpful and above all very efficient. Nothing was too much trouble for him. He did an excellent job on the repair, he is a great asset to Homeserve.",HomeServe
"Contacted HomeServe. That same day they arranged for a plumber to visit and the problem was resolved.The plumber was polite, efficient and kept me informed at each stage of the work. ",HomeServe
"The first time you cancelled on me, I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind as it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a dire emergency. The second time was more annoying as you didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let me know until the day after the appointment, but obviously weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d stayed in the whole day not knowing you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show. Third time was the charm, but it was late on a Sunday which apparently put your tech in a mood as it Ã¢â‚¬Å“WasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an emergency.Ã¢â‚¬Â and consequently he was quite short with my wife. A day or two later we also noticed heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d broken the cover to the outside stop cock. Possibly due to his frustration. But, the job was completed and we no longer have a leak in our garage - hence the two stars. ",HomeServe
"The whole package, easy booking of time and date, the plumber was excellent and very helpful.",HomeServe
The plumber ascertained the problem and had the relevant spare part (a new ballcock) in his van and fitted it in the loft then tested it to make sure the problem had been rectified.  He offered to remove his shoes which I appreciated but this was not necessary,HomeServe
The gentleman that came to look at the drains was friendly and solved the problem quickly.,HomeServe
"Prompt answering call for help,plumber here within 2 hours  fitted new taps to replace leaking unit Very pleasent personality Well satisfied THANK YOU.",HomeServe
From the initial reporting on the phone to the final outcome the service was excellent and professional thus giving us peace of mind after seeing water in the kitchen.   Thanks so much to all involved,HomeServe
Arrived on time and carried out a repair on our leaking tap efficiently ,HomeServe
"We were very impressed by the service we were given by Homeserve. The booking was easy with a good timeframe. The plumber sent was Ben. He was very polite, friendly and very efficient in his work. He did an excellent job, was careful to clear everything up when finished and was a pleasure to have in our home. Thank you",HomeServe
Still waiting for Woolco to contact me to fix the leak. I keep ringing Homeserve and they keep promising that Woolco will contact us. When I first reported the leak the Homeserve person was only interested in taking my excess money before discussing our issue. Now that you have my money you have done absolutely nothing. ,HomeServe
We had a leaking external pipe which was spotted at a weekend.  I notified the HomeServ and the earliest appointment for this was on the following Wednesday.  However one of their operatives was passing on the Monday and he excavated and repaired the pipe then rather than waiting a further two days.  I was very grateful to HomeServ for taking the initiative on this.,HomeServe
I had a problem with a leak in the airing cupboard and arranged a visit from HomeServe. They came quite quickly but didn't have the part with them. I was told it would be delivered to my house but it wasn't. Two appointments were made and cancelled by HS. After two weeks the part was picked up and the work was done very well. It took far too long to pick up the part needed. I don't think there was very good communication between the call line and the engineers as no one seemed to know what was going on. ,HomeServe
"Plumber was on time polite,helpful about the ongoing problem. Very tidy   with the work. All together very good",HomeServe
The plumber was on time and completed the work efficiently ,HomeServe
Initial call out was not great. Nothing much investigated and the guys left claiming the leak was a drain blockage and arranged an appointment with a drainage engineer.  Which did not happen.  But after complaining things got sorted quickly.  Drainage appointment rebooked and a very efficient guy put cameras through the drains - which were all fine.  Plumber recalled.  A different and really wonderful plumber did extensive work and found the elusive leak and fixed it at a second visit.  Very thankful to finally have it sorted. ,HomeServe
"All three of the Homeserve plumbers who attended my property (on three occasions) were courteous, arrived on time, called me before to let me know what time they would be arriving, and were respectful of my property and my home.",HomeServe
Ease of reporting problem Available date for engineer to visit was made. The engineer came within the timeframe chosen.He carried out the repair with new parts he had on his vanMy verdict was a professional job carried out all round,HomeServe
"I had to have the drain unblocked for a second time. This time the engineer managed to identify the cause and fix the the problem. He was very helpful and conscientious and although it took some time to seal the drain, he did a great job. I am very grateful for the work he carried out.",HomeServe
"HAVING BEEN A CUSTOMER FOR OVER 20YEARS AT 2 ADDRESSES AND NOT MADE A CLAIM I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPANY COULD NOT FIX THE REPAIR TO MY SHOWER, FURTHER MORE I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT I FUTHER CALLED THEM ABOUT A LEAKING TAP BUT DUE TO THE TAPS BEING BRASS THEY REFUSED TO REPIAR THEM",HomeServe
"The booking was easy, I was advised of the date and approximate time right away and the plumber rang to let me know his arrival time on the day. The plumber fixed the problem with no fuss and left the bathroom clean and tidy. I couldn't ask for more.",HomeServe
"Having used HomeServe twice in the last few weeks my experience has been overwhelmingly good. First for a broken tap and then later there was a leak in my underground water supply pipe. On both of these occasions the plumbers were pleasant, friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Both repairs were done to a high standard.",HomeServe
"Seized water stop cock/tap,Well done to the 2 engineers, from arrival to departing all done in 30min's, everything explained what was to be done, cleared up afterwards and put the cooker back. Thanks'....",HomeServe
Homeserve were easy to contact and promptly sent a plumber. His name was Barrie who was great. Explained the problem with the radiator and promptly fixed it. Explaining what he had done. He was friendly and polite. A satisfied customer. Thank you. ,HomeServe
The first visit from Homeserve was 10/9/24 for a faulty cistern and a dripping tap which were both sorted. Had to ask for a re-call  on 24/9/24 as the cistern was not flushing again! This was fixed very quickly by another homeserve plumber and is now working perfectly..,HomeServe
Toilet repair.The engineer explained clearly what the problem was with the toilet flushing and carried out a very good repair in good time.,HomeServe
After the appointment being cancelled and rebooked  times the plumber who came did an excellent job.,HomeServe
Need two visits. Second plumber seems not interested to seal the gap stating he did not remove it. However it was removed by the first plumber who left the job undone saying parts are unavailable ATM.,HomeServe
"Plumber came to rectify an awkward leak under the kitchen sink.  He worked diligently and took time, trouble and care to try and solve the frustrating issue.",HomeServe
Really easy and straight forward to take the pluming and drainage policy ,HomeServe
From start to finish the person booking a visit to the team investigating the leak .Everything was quick and dealt with very professionally. Would recommend anyone taking out a Homeserve policy as it gave me complete peace of mind . ,HomeServe
Quick response and the plumber was excellent. Seems like HomeServe have changed their approach and actually invested in quality tradespeople ,HomeServe
Very efficient- very quickly repaired upstairs toilet cistern- no mess. Brilliant,HomeServe
"Easy to book , fast response and next day appointments available. Plumber communicated well and arrived on time , job done !! ",HomeServe
Attended on time as mentioned.  Efficient in sorting blockage on Bath waste pipe ,HomeServe
The engineer arrived promptly the next morning. He rang me to say he was on his way. He was friendly and efficient and he unblocked my very disgusting drain. Even said it wasn't bad at all as I felt embarrassed about it. All in all great service and easy to use,HomeServe
The lady on the phone was lovely very helpful when the man came before he came through the gate he was talking to my husband who said there was a leak under the shower and straight away he said I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do silicone if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that what it needs he shone a torch under the shower and said yes needs silicone he wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t here above 15 minutes and on closer inspection by my husband after he left their was a hairline crack in the shower tray which obviously had been leaking for a while causing a lot of damage ruining the floorboards and having to remove the whole shower cubicle and replace with a new one it was about 3pm when he arrived and he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem that interested IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry to say,HomeServe
Getting an appointment was easy to do. Plumber came on time and job was completed quickly and efficiently with  no mess.,HomeServe
When the plumber eventually came he did an excellent repair I was very happy with his work. ,HomeServe
"Homeswerve, the cover doesn't state set appointment times for engineers to call, so far I've had 3 days ruined and wasted by homeswerve, day one plumber reckons he called,,knock on the door? No phone call or calling card posted saying he did?day two plumber turns up late afternoon he looked at the job and said he had to order the parts?Day three I waited in all day the I got a phone call from the plumber at 3, 30 saying he couldn't do the job it was a two-man job to change washers on bath taps? Day 4 the plumber promised me he would make my job his first appointment, he would be with me at 9, but this didn't happen, I phoned customer service with my complaint, but I had no luck there they were unhelpful and it seemed I was the one out of order for complaining ",HomeServe
Quickly solved my drainage problem. Engineer very helpful. Gave useful tips too. ,HomeServe
Easy to contact. Quick to respond. Plumber was very obliging at arranging suitable time. Even though the office had set a time of sometime AM.,HomeServe
"I called Homeserve on a Sunday morning, and an engineer was at my house before lunchtime. He wasfriendly and polite, and had unblocked my main drain really quickly.  I am really glad I  have this insurance",HomeServe

"The person who changed the cartridges on my tap , it was a quick and easy job to do , he was very efficient and friendly",HomeServe
The home serve plumbers arrived at the time agreed explained what was required and completed the job in the time stated.  They were polite and courteous.  When finished everything was on good order.  Both men are a credit to home serve.,HomeServe
Hand wash tap was leaking and new tap was fixed.However the tap is wrong type and water is splashing everywhere. Rang twice and told nothing can be done.I got to buy a new tap.  ,HomeServe
The plumber was very polite and did a good job,HomeServe
Had a major leak on the internal stop valve. Plumber responded within the hour and quickly rectified the problem ,HomeServe
"Mains water leak found and repaired. Was difficult to find due to complexity of driveway and other services underground, so took longer than anticipated but dealt with as a matter of urgency.All team involved on site were polite, friendly, informative and tidy.",HomeServe
"I wasnt very impressed this time with using Homeserve, which was a shame. As previous experience has been great. I had to pay a Ã‚Â£30 excess for an engineer to replace a Ã‚Â£3 washer, which I had already done before. The issue has improved slightly but isnt resolved. Acording to the engineer, I'll need to pay another excess if I want them to look at it again. I think as it was a Sunday, he just wanted to get in and out as soon as possible, wheras the previous engineer I had for the same issue with a different toilet, replaced the entire mechanism and resolved the issue first time.",HomeServe
"I was impressed by the speed of response to my message. I was called back, an emergency plumber was with me and the repair done all within a couple of hours.",HomeServe
"Hi Home Serve, Thank you for your help regarding my kitchen tap valve replacements. The first Engineer came out on the Bank Holiday Sunday evening, unfortunately he was unable to repair because he had to order new cartridges for both hot and cold sides of the mixer tap. These were delivered to the wrong address by the delivery firm. Home Serve was in contact most days until replacements arrived. The second engineer arrived on the day and time arranged. Both engineers were very polite and helpful. Thank you once again great service.",HomeServe
"Very easy to book a slot over the phone and helpful staff. The plumber that came out was 20 minutes late for my time slot and just looked at the shower and said to couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be fixed, he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even turn it on. As I pay monthly anyway, I think a further Ã‚Â£30 on top of that for him to do nothing was excessive.",HomeServe
The engineer understood the problem and efficiently cleared the blocked drain.,HomeServe
"Expected between 2-6pm arrived at 9.30pm.  Fixed the leak issue.  Didn't turn on the stop cock back on, said it was broken and to phone Thames Water.  So no water available until Thames Water could come out the next day.  Thames Water arrived next morning and turned the stop cock back on said NO PROBLEM WITH THE STOP COCK. IT WAS NOT BROKEN!",HomeServe
The plumber rectified the toilet that no other plumbers could do over the years! ,HomeServe
Very prompt response to my call (same day) and though a new part was required for the toilet that soon arrived and was fitted the day after delivery.The troublesome tap was replaced immediately.Both engineers were polite and efficient.,HomeServe
"I was very pleased with the immediate prompt response to get a plumber out to me and the plumber was very good, seeming to know whatever he needed to know.  However, he needed to order a part and from then on the service was very poor.   After waiting several days and hearing nothing, I decided to ring HomeServe and was told to wait in between 0800 and 1800 on 19th September because they could see the part was in (I gather it might have been in for several days but no one picked up on it).   on the 19th, having stayed in all day, I eventually received a phone call about 3.30 p.m. to say that I ""should not have been given this date"" and would I stay in the next day when they'd get the plumber to visit.   Why did the office have to wait until 3.30 p.m. to let me know that no one was coming?   I knew I was going to be out the following day (20th) so it was agreed someone would come between 1530 and 1800 - no one did.   So I phoned HomeServe office again on Monday 23rd and was asked to stay in from 0800 to 1800 - the plumber came about 1715-ish.As an aside, I have no idea what it might have cost me in phone calls while I was waiting for people to find out what was going on.My problem was a lavatory which continuously flushed so my daughter was able to turn off a small stopcock.   Fortunately, I have an upstairs loo, but at 80 years of age that isn't very convenient.  It is also fortunate that I'm retired and, although I am at home a lot, I was definitely inconvenienced on the four occasions I was required to be at home between certain hours.   I also tried to stay home as much as possible from 10th September onwards, when I thought the spare part might arrive and I'd be getting a phone call to tell me so.after submitting the above Review I very promptly received an email response from HomeServe and the very next received a phone call from them.   They were very concerned, acknowledged the lines of communication had a hiccup and offered some compensation for the length of time I had to wait with a non-functioning loo.   They couldn't have been more helpful and I am definitely renewing my contract with them!   Thank you HomeServe.",HomeServe
"Water dripping onto the floor from the bathroom sink is no way to start the day. So a very necessary call to Home Serve was required. Details were supplied, as asked, and a date was give for a plumber to attend. Plumber duly arrived, identified the problem,fitted a new drain on to the sink, and normal service was resumed in short time.",HomeServe
The Drains Man who came out understood the problem exactly and helped me to contact Severn Trent whose responsibility it turned out to be.   The issue is now under the control of Severn Trent who will need to do some remedial work.  Thanks for your efficiency.  Gabrielle,HomeServe
"Great guys ,very helpful (reminding me I had pipe insurance as well ) ",HomeServe
The plumber changed the bath plug assembly as part of the service. A very good service,HomeServe
"Initial call out, they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn up -  I had an appointment booked for 13th August but they never turned up and never let me know they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t coming.  When I rang them to chase, I was met with a girl who couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really care less. I was offered another appointment in 2 weeks time which was when I put my foot down and was offered one in 2 days time. The following day someone parked up the road but did not get out the van. Apparently he was doing a pre inspection even though he could not see the leak from the van. The day of the appointment the engineer was fantastic. He was very friendly and helpful. He explained everything and carried out the work in a timely manor.",HomeServe
"Homeserve were instructed to check plumbing for a leak to the incoming water main. They failed to turn up for 1st appointment, but when they carried out an inspection, they were thorough, efficient, and found the leak.",HomeServe
"We had a drain blocked outside so phoned to book an appointment. Although I was disappointed to find it was an automated service, in fairness it did work and couldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had an appointment the same day, but I chose the following day. Once the crew arrived on site it was found that the blockage was in the shared drain so unfortunately we werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered for this (which it clearly states in your policy). The crew advised us that shared drains are covered by the local water authority which for us is Anglian Water and they kindly called the issue through to them for us. The only reason I gave a 4 star instead of a 5 is because where the crew found the blockage and advised we had a inspection cover under the patio somewhere. After lifting about 20 slabs to expose the cover ready for Anglian Water. There wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one,  and that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t where the actual blockage turned out to be so we pulled them up for no reason and then had to relay them Ã°Å¸ËœÂ©. The excess was Ã‚Â£30 so everything considered, I thought it was worth paying as we found out some useful information. I was also pleased to find that Home serve had credited the Ã‚Â£30 bank into my bank a few days later. Thank you",HomeServe
Great service - easy to book appointment online and plumber was great and sorted the issue quickly and professionally Ã°Å¸ËœÅ ,HomeServe
"The olumber was professional and efficient, however, from the initial booking the service, there were several cancellations made before we received the service. ",HomeServe
Great service from start to finish - the gentleman was polite friendly and really went the extra mile to troubleshoot and get the job done - worked his magic to locate the elusive hidden manhole - to get the blockage shifted - would not hesitate to recommend. ,HomeServe
"The plumbers arrived on time and fixed my leaking radiator valve. They did a great job. On the downside, I had to wait several days for the appointment. That's not what I expect from an ""emergency"" service. I had to keep emptying buckets. Good job the leak wasn't worse. ",HomeServe
Problem seems to have been fixed well enough.  Took some time due to matters largely outside of the control of the engineer/plumber.  ,HomeServe
2 engineers visited to resolve a plumbing issue which they thought had been fixed one week prior but part was faulty. Engineers explained fault and replaced part all working correctly.,HomeServe
Excellent!! 1st guy managed to find the fault and recommended that zkthe problem needed to be fixed by a plumber...He did not leave until he got the plumber organised for me.Extremely helpful and courteous explained exactly why one needed to attend.Plumber came and again extremely courteous and respectful.  As an elderly person it made a pleasant change and I was so appretiative..Again explained what he needed to do and solved the problem.  Explained it may reoccur... and if it does need to check behind cistern and remove tiles.  Your employees are a credit to you and your training.  Also learnt that a friend I recommendef across court yard now uses his services too as recommended by me.,HomeServe
Very friendly & considerate plumbers and staff on the help / booking desk who took account of my needs.,HomeServe
"Arrived on time, did the job quickly, polite, the overflow stopped and very pleased with your employee.  Thank you",HomeServe

Blocked drain dealt with quickly and professionally,HomeServe
"Extremely disappointed as stayed in today for an emergency drain blockage appointment booked between 8am and 1pm. Nobody turned up. Contacted homeserve excuse was engineer was busy on another call. Rebooked for tomorrow. They didn't even have the courtesy to let us know. I wonder if they will turn up tomorrow and compensate us for the inconvenience caused. I am really not impressed with their service. They did turn up on sunday and unblocked the drain,I have since had a phone call from homeserve and spoken to a representative and they were very apologetic and I have accepted their apology and explanation ",HomeServe
Really pleased with the service. Had a leaking tap. They fixed it quickly and the man arrived when he said he would and was very polite. What's not to like. ,HomeServe
I was contacted and all seemed efficiently handled. I was told the upfront payment couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be cancelled as he woukd be arranging a person to come out and he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be stopped. I got a call from a man asking for pictures of tge drain cover. I said I was sick so could take a picture from my porch but doubt heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d see much detail. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll sort it I was told. At 11:10am I received another call from the first man who said he was arranging someon to come out. No toilet has been blocked five days and it was now Friday. Nit their fault but nevertheless I expected them to understand the urgency with the weekend coming next day. He kept asking if I was ok. I was annoyed as I kept saying no as im sick. I asked why he kept asking. He said he had to. If was like he was reading from a card   A set set of remarks and questions. I was appalled when he told me a specialist could come out Monday tfen he said if someone could come out ti his afternoon. I thought. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve laid Ã‚Â£180 to this office for this ???!  I asked. Why are you even asking me this question ? I did say it was urgent. I asked if the man coming out was a specialist. I as told Yes. I really didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand all this delay. I was then hold a man we oils coms out between 1 snd 4pm.  I hoped it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t 4p. for if there was a major problem u couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see it getting fixed that day. To be honest I thought IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d wasted my money. The plumber arrived mid afternoon. He was excellent. Sighing one hour heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d done two adjustments to the toilet to make it flush better. He sealed in the. Toilet pipe. He cleared the blockage. He cleaned up. He left a full report. I would have that plumber all day long. U didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t begrudge that lament Ã‚Â£180 plus Ã‚Â£8 parts. Next time IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll go direct to him. He mad good recommendations. Gd was efficient and quick. He thought unblocking everything was it. But he listened to all my concerns and fixed everything in the spot. No messing. It was j thought worth laying the kffice fee to fund him. I was advised to join Home Serce for plumbing to save in the future.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only ;Ã‚Â£12 s year   I followed his advice. Very professional  trader I was happy to pay that day as I had so many things to be sorted. I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pay this Ho just unblock the toilet.This company is very expensive but they had a very good plumber and he went the extra mile,HomeServe

"Politeness of gentleman who attended and completed our problem. Although it was twenty four hours after first flagging up our problem with taps and continuous running water. We actually lost a lotÃ¢â‚¬Â¦if not all our hot water!   We rate very highly service provided by HomeServe UK and continue to do so,  although on this occasion we believe this Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcall outÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ could have been considered a priority and was not. Thank you, Mr. Danny Ashton-Booth, customer from way back. ",HomeServe
"We didnt have to wait for an appointment. The plumber was friendly, knowledgeable and located the problem quickly. Thankyou.",HomeServe
"Good plumber, who gave me good advice. Came out promptly!",HomeServe
You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to provide any service we actually need. We will be cancelling as soon as possible. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve called you three times for pipe related matters and there is always a reason why you cannot help. Enough in enough. ,HomeServe
"The worker arrived and was in the house no longer than 5 mins, disinterested and couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get away quick enough and the job wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done. His words Ã¢â‚¬ËœNot a job I can doÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Customer service on the other hand were absolutely brilliant and responded quickly to my complaint. I was refunded my excess, which is good as we had to get someone else to come out and fix our leak. We pay quite a lot every month for our cover and still pay an excess on top. Disappointed in the service, especially after reading through what we pay to cover the job that needed to be fixed was apparently covered. ",HomeServe
"Work to replace seized stopcock was carried out by Steve.He was great and very efficient, very professional  and the work was of a very high standard .Very pleased",HomeServe

"Very quick response to blocked drain,same day! Very professional engineer who cleared it in minutes and was very friendly,would highly recommend this company.",HomeServe
"Bathroom, sink, toilet not clearing properly. Plumber from Homeserve arrived in second day after callout. Could not see an issue as system was clearing. He called for a cctv/ blockage guy who arrived day 3. Put the cctv into the drains, found they were full of water. Explained that it looked like the problem was off our property, probably in the neighbours, and he could not go there as we were his clients. I offered to remove decking for access to the manhole and was told to call South West Water and say we had no facilities which meant that had to come out within 4 hours. Southwest Water duly arrived. I removed the decking from the manhole and lo and behold the blockage was in my man hole. Seems this happens frequently between Homeserve and South West Water.",HomeServe
"Quick and efficient. Plumber arrived on time, was helpful and polite and quickly diagnosed and solved the problem.",HomeServe
Plumber was friendly and did a great job.  Booking the appointment was very easy and there was no long waiting time.,HomeServe
Thank you. Had a terrioble problem with the sewage going everywhere and an emergency plumber arrived at 8 am on a Saturday. He was lovely and went out of his way to assist. A big thank you ,HomeServe
I loved the engineers. They were fab. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like the people who answered the phones;  apart from the one I spoke to at night. She was nice and helpful. one in particular was rude. They didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t organise visits properly Ã¢â‚¬Â¦. I was left without water for a long time and on one day no one arrived at all! ,HomeServe
Plumber arrived within the specified time frame. Job was completed quickly and successfully. ,HomeServe
"Excellent work by Home Serve employees! Had water supply pipe issues. They were booked 3 days later from the initial report of the issue, but came a day early as the previous job finished quicker than expected.

Good efficient repair.Did cancel the original repair but was out first thing the next morning.Engineer was friendly and very knowledgeable.Would recommend if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know a reliable plumber.,HomeServe
"first of all. The engineer that first came did what he had to do but could not find the water leak, so he rang a number and this was in the evening and spoke to some one who told him I would get a phone call within the next 4 hours. I waited up to 2am the next morning *NO PHONE CALL* I then had to wait and ring Homeserve again (may I add) to get an engineer out. In the mean time the meter was spinning round at a ridiculous rate. the second engineer found the water leak and done an excellent job FIRST RATE I'D LIKE TO ADD. I would appreciate it if you would try to find out why this happened? I've been with Home Serve for years and I can honestly say I could count the number of times I have called you out on one hand actually less. Thankyou L. Martin ",HomeServe
The guy doing the repair work did everything expected and more. The reason IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve marked this down is because the automated claim process is an absolute pain. It wrongly identified the problem and sent a request out to a drainage guy rather than a plumber. For god sake just employ some more call handlers rather than cheaping out with automated AI. ,HomeServe
As usual a chatty friendly plumber. Found a mouse stuck in pipe from header tank to immersion tank. Few more checks and all ok. ,HomeServe

"Very happy with the service provided by Homeserve. First call out was for a blocked toilet. The plumber was in the house for no more than five minutes. Toilet blockage cleared.A second call a week later was for the same toilet, but this time to fix the cistern that was really slow to fill.Both occasions the two different plumbers were polite and efficient explaining what they were doing the whole time. A very happy customer.There is one thing I would like to see on the Homeserve website when creating a claim. At the moment the user is guided through creating the claim but it only accepts specific responses. In addition to this, it would be really handy to be able to add some additional notes for the claimant and for  that information to be passed on to the person doing the work so they can be more prepared.

"I was very pleased that a plumber could come to repair our water pipe when I reported it on Sunday, we had no water from them until Tuesday when he came. Unfortunately he wasn't able to fix it so we had to wait another day for a different plumber. From Sunday to Wednesday with no water was no fun but I was grateful to have it repaired and the cost covered. Our insurance with Homeserve is due for renewal with a new and very increased yearly cost of Ã‚Â£222. Unfortunately it's unaffordable so I won't be renewing.",HomeServe

"The man came and went to look at the problem . I had mopped up the water so I told him where the leak seemed to be, After 5 minutes he told me he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find a leak, but nevertheless he went back into the bathroom. He then said he thought the leak was coming from the shower. He decided to reseal around the shower then he left. I have not had water leaking since so perhaps he did a repair after all.",HomeServe

"Normally when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Homeserve own engineers, it seems quite good. Recently I had a plumber booked, when they turned up, they said they are contractors to Homeserve, they walk into our house on the carpet with their shoes on, no shoe covers or even ask if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ok. Then they ask me to sign something is their own contract form (a bit uncomfortable with this), and there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much time for me to read, as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on their phone. If i donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sign, the fees I paid for the appointment would be wasted, and i donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know what I signed for. And they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really fix the toilet flush handle, they only tightened the screw, which I told them I did that myself and that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work for long time, they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care to fix it properly. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t call Homeserve about this, as I was afraid they would send over the same person. ",HomeServe
Had repair booked 23/9 Plummer arrive looked at repair and stated his time allowed was 1/2hour and it would take 2jours to fix so left making a new appointment for an all day slot on 30/9 received call around 16.30 saying Plummer would not be attending (having made arrangement to accommodate this and therefore waited in all day)with another appointment made for 1/10 8pm to 12.00 and again received call at 10.30ish again informing me of Plummer not able to attend so guess what make new appointment for tomorrow- anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guess if Plummer will turn up!!,HomeServe
Excellent response and attention. Plumber tidy and clean. Job completed. Rated 4 star at this time only as the WC flush button sticks at times since.,HomeServe
"Two engineers worked on an undetectable water leak at my house.Firstly, the replaced my stopcock and then tried to determine where the leak was occurring.

Appointment made no one turned up. Made another appointment turned up checked were told the problem is not outside.  My problem is still the same. I think the first plumber who came diagnosed the fault wrongly and the second person was right in that the fault was not outside the house ",HomeServe

Problem definition relies on inadequate information. I was asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“is it a leak from an inlet or drainage?Ã¢â‚¬Â. I said drainage from an upstairs shower. The AI system just heard Ã¢â‚¬Å“drainageÃ¢â‚¬Â and sent someone to dig up the ground! Second person came the following day and was excellent.,HomeServe

My  waste pipe has a problem and I informed Homeserve about it. I was asked to pay the excess of Ã‚Â£60.00 which I did. They sent someone to check it who promised that an engineer will come for the repairs.  It is over a week nobody has come to repair the pipe. ,HomeServe
The plumber was very polite and friendly. He quickly identified the problem and replaced the faulty item as it was not repairable. The plumber was very professional at all times and demonstrated expertise in his knowledge. A first rate plumber,HomeServe
"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not someone who normally responds to requests for feedback, but on this occasion felt the need to.The plumber arrived promptly, with a phone call beforehand. He was upbeat, listened carefully to my concerns and found the problem quickly. The leak was fixed and all mess cleared away. Really good advice given and we felt comfortable whilst the plumber was in our home.Thankfully, we were still able to make a claim over the phone and make an appointment to suit us.

"Home serve treated me badly because I am disabled!!I first called Home Serve because I had blocked Drains mid August 24. Today is third of October. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been out on six different occasions and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve told me that there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a problem. It was very temporary and they fixed it and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gone. The last visit took place on the 1st of October and they told me that the problem was on the main road and I needed to get in touch with Thames Water. Thames Water came out and they checked using a camera and they saw that the blockage was within my boundary, they showed me pictures and they showed me evidence.I went back and booked another visit with Home Serve. They were meant to come today between 12 midday and 6 pm. They called me at 4 oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢clock to say that there is nobody available with the right equipment to come out to me today! What and They didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know before 4 oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢clock , that their man did not have the right equipment?  Such a poor service because their trades people get paid for the job are not the quality they take shortcuts every opportunity because for the last five visits they have done a quick water flush and said there are problems solved and it was never resolved- I have insured my Drains with somebody else now I would never go back to Home ServeAdditional update following the message below from home serve- when I complaint to the person who rang me Ã¢â‚¬ËœCraigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ they did not want to know and when I said this is u acceptable his answer was well we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come until Saturday, so why now all of a sudden you are interred in my name and address??? Is it because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done this review , now I matter? I did say that to the chap on the phone that if he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take this seriously I will write a review Ã¢â‚¬Â¦and so I did!!!Update- I contacted home serve as per their message below and they did nothing!!! They only give that as a standard reply so others think they take complaints seriously, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the 14th Oct today and I am still waiting! I have cancelled my contract with them. ",HomeServe

"As a landlord, my experience with this service was appalling. I purchased the top-tier cover for one of my buy-to-let properties, expecting protection for potential issues with gas, electricity, and plumbing. However, when I needed to use the service, things became a nightmare.The first appointment, for a simple dripping tap, took several weeks due to consistent cancellations by the engineers or their failure to show up. After the issue was finally resolved, I contacted the company to express my dissatisfaction. To their credit, they conducted a prompt investigation and offered me a partial refund.Unfortunately, the second time I had to use the service, it was the same story all over againÃ¢â‚¬â€engineers unavailable, last-minute cancellations, or no-shows. On one occasion, they left a note in the letterbox saying, ""sorry we missed you,"" despite never ringing or calling anyone at the property.In the end, I cancelled the policy and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even bother filing a formal complaint. I hope this helps others in the community avoid a similar experience.",HomeServe
"Call had to be re-scheduled. Fine; it was not an emergency. But I was not informed of the new appointment date, fortunately I was in when the plumber called. Job done quickly and entirely to my satisafaction.",HomeServe

"I phoned because water was flooding from beneath the washing machine and, after some recorded message stuff, was put through to a young lady I struggled to understand and who clearly knew nothing beyond the questions on her list. I asked if I could speak to someone with knowledge and she put me through to another woman who I also struggled to understand and who knew nothing more than the first. I said I was not asking for the machine to be repaired but I didn't actually know if the machine was the problem or if it was drains...or what. I was mopping frantically to try and stop water damage to freezer and central heating boiler and they were so unhelpful it made me weep. Later that evening a plumber phoned because the second woman had made an appointment. It was dark and late but he was kind and helpful, I decided the situation had stabilised and I would contact a machine repair person in the morning. The plumber and I agreed I would return to Homeserve if it turned out to be an issue within your remit. I did not record the date but it was either 19/20 September.",HomeServe
"At first we were told that a plumber would not be available until the next day.I later rang up and complained about having no electricityor water (leaking through kitchen light) and how my husband is over 80.  We were then told a plumber would come at 10 pm.  He did and was excellent and veryefficient in diagnosing the problem and advising us whatto do, even though we were not covered for the repair.",HomeServe

"Making a claim can be very daunting, for me, anyway.So, I always tried to avoid it if possible, but HomeServe makes it so much easier. Very easy and quick. Great customer service with all excellent engineers. Always gave 5 stars for that, but gave 4 stars this time. This is because replaced bathtub and basin tabs are not up to standard. I assumed that replacements should be either same or better if it cannot be same. I completely understand HomeServe must have a budget for any replacements - it seems the cheapest ones. I wish HomeServe gave me an option to pay a difference to match either same or better replacements. I would have been more than happy to pay the difference for decent replacements. Bathtub and basin tabs are smaller and uglier than old ones and look so bad, looking like tabs in a cheap B&B. Very sad every time I look at them.",HomeServe
Initial response to receive a site visit to ascertain the source of our water leak was efficient and suggested cause was outlined. However the cost of monthly prescription seems excessive if that is the total commitment provided by Homeserve. I assumed that the necessary work would also be carried out to fix the problem,HomeServe
I phoned about a leak under my kitchen sink the agent I spoke to was excellent he booked me in for the next day. I was kept up to date to when the plumber was arriving. When he did arrive he was respectful and listened to what the problem was. He should me picture of the problem which made it all clear to what had happened. It was all fix within the hour. He cleared up after he had finished. Excellent work it was so easy and great piece of mind I will definitely use them and I had told everyone had good the service is. I definitely recommend Home Serve. ,HomeServe

"Plumber courteous, professional and quick to resolve issue.",HomeServe
Prompt visit. Guy made a temporary repair and returned a week later with a part. All now ok.,HomeServe
"Excellent service once again! We had a leaky loo which had been fixed previously by a dodgy plumber. HomeServe came out assessed and ordered the correct part from the original manufacturer. They returned a few days later completed the job quickly, left no mess and fit the toilet back in behind the panel as if they had never been at all! Thanks again for an excellent service.The only point I would call out is I think there is a slight fault in your app, when I have booked my last two jobs IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve entered the fields correctly but on the manage appointments page they show as different categories. I.e my last appt i booked underground pipe, but it went through your system as overground pipe - just something to get your techyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to look into :) ",HomeServe
Plumber quick and efficient.  I am elderly and live alone so Homeserve is my peace of mind when things go wrong.,HomeServe
The plumber who did my repairs was excellent ,HomeServe
"The plumber was experienced. He knew the cause of the problem, he explained it clearly and he fixed it for us. The cistern is now working well. ",HomeServe
"The engineer turned up when booked, found the fault (a perished washer) under the sink, and replaced it quickly. Cannot fault the service on the day but had to wait 2 days for an engineer to visit.",HomeServe
There was leak in the house from the plumbing. The engineer said that it was not covered although it was a supply pipe to the bathroom. I had to get a private plumber to fix the leak. ,HomeServe
The plumber that visited was very good and very friendly. ,HomeServe
Had two visits and lots of advice from 2 very helpful plumbers. ,HomeServe
Problem solved with leak ,HomeServe
water came into our utility room due the amount of rain blocking the drain. I telephoned at 8.30 in the morning and the technician arrived at 10.40 and cleared the blockage ,HomeServe
"Booking the appointment was easy via the HomeServe website. The plumber arrived within the agreed time slot and rang to say he was on his way. Friendly and professional, the plumber completed the work fitting replacement parts in a timely manner.",HomeServe
Drainage engineer visited to replace a leaking waste pipe but didn't have any pipe which seems pretty pointless. He said he had a bit of pipe last week but used it!?!I was told they'd called back but had to chase 4 days later and was then kept on hold so a simple call to re-book a repair appointment took 10 minutes!,HomeServe
"Very easy to book an appoinment, but not very soon. Then  they cancelled the first appointment and rebooked. The plumber was on time, very polite and did a good job.",HomeServe
Charlie Keightley helped us out immensely when we had a bad water leak. Him and his team were great. Thanks to him the leak has been fixed.,HomeServe
"We had a suspected water leak which could have been in a piece of pipe running under a field. We arranged for  Homeserve to come on the Thursday. We were surprised but delighted to see the Homeserve guy arrive on the Tuesday - 2 days early - He said he had come to look at the problem in case he might need any extra equipment on the Thursday. He had a quick look at the pipework near the house, found the problem and dealt with it there & then. Job Done and two days early! Great service.",HomeServe
The person who came to our house arrived at tge agreed time and very quickly analysed the cause of the leak. From arriving to completing the work involved took less than an hour. I was very impressed and pleased the leak was rectified before any real damage was caused.,HomeServe
"Plumber came to look at toilet that would not flush.  Unable to fix so we bought a new toilet, via Homeserve.  I spoke to 'On Demand' to arrange a replacement and was told they would contact me when a replacement has been sourced.  After several days I called to get an update and was informed that they were waiting for me to make payment to so that they could arrange a plumber to install the new toilet - you need to call me and tell me what the replacement toilet and installation costs in order that I can pay!!!!Appointment made and plumber arrived with new toilet to install.  However, the toilet was for a right- hand inlet installation and plumber decided that, due to pipework, a left-hand inlet toilet was required.  Plumber informed the 'Parts Department' who, I was told, would contact me if there was any further payment required and would arrange installation date.After a couple of days I called to get an update and was informed that Homeserve were waiting for me to make payment of the difference so that they could arrange a plumber to install the new new toilet - sound familiar?  YOU NEED TO CALL ME AND TELL ME HOW MUCH I NEED TO PAY so that an installation appointment can be made.On a positive side, the plumbers were polite and very helpful.",HomeServe
my toilet was almost blocked the chap who came to mend it explained he wasnt a plumber but he sorted it and reassured me that if the problem recurs i can ring again and a plumber will come out with no extra charge which is good to know . its been fine ,HomeServe
Good service and fixed the tap,HomeServe
"Repair to cistern carried out very professionally. Was very happy. Engineer installed a better, more modern item that we had previously and explained how it worked.",HomeServe
"I've used Homeserve Plumbing and Drainage Cover, and now I'm taking advantage of their Electrics Cover too as their service has always been prompt when I've needed them and it's a small price to pay for lasting peace of mind.",HomeServe
Irritated by poor flushing in my en-suite.  I called Home serve.  Secured a fairly quick appointment and the job was done and dusted in about half an hour.  No mess either.  ,HomeServe
The engineer came to stop a leaking tap. He rang to let me know when he was on his way. Went straight upstairs to look at the tap and fetched some items from his van. ,HomeServe
"Excellent service, we called Homeserve very late on a Sunday evening regarding a faulty toilet and came on Monday and rectified the problem with new parts.",HomeServe
Very quick response and lovely very informative plumber.  Good job no mess ,HomeServe
The person who arrived at 1-30pm worked so hard to fix the problem.the toilet is now working first class.He finally left at 4-20pm after all the work he had to do to solve the problems.Can you thank him again from me.RegardsMrs Linda Atkinson,HomeServe
Plumber came within 4 hours ... sorted problem with no fuss or delay...job well done,HomeServe
"Homeserve came out to locate and fix a mains water leak.They came out within 4 days which is excellent and located and fixed the leak the same day.However the engineer was reluctant to fix it as felt the cause was from a pre existing leak. After much debate and him contacting his boss, he finally agreed to fix the leak due to having insurance in place over 5 months. However he left my drive way in a filthy state. Thankfully I have a jet washer and was able to clear this myself but I'm disappointed that this isn't something they do considering they have created the mess. Not sure how I would have cleared this without a jet washer or if I wasn't mobile. He has also left 3 bags of rubbish with the promise a van follows him and collects it.",HomeServe
The drain specialist that came was friendly and helpful. Gave me great pointers on how to keep the drain clean ,HomeServe
I called Homeserve about changing  the main stop tap which was stuck fast. It was arranged for the following day. The plumber came and it was sorted in no time. As simple as that! I wish all services were this efficient. ,HomeServe
Contacted HomeServe about a water leak in the front garden on Sunday afternoon.  Considerable and constant water loss from our property and into and down the road.  Given a Tuesday visit by an engineer. Remained in the house all day until 4.30 when contacted by HomeServe. The engineer would not be coming. Some sort of delay.  Expected a visit the following day but no it wouldn't be until Saturday afternoon! So nearly 4 more days of wasted water and local residents expressing concerns about what they were seeing.  Managed to get a Saturday morning visit.  Engineer was great and completed the repair in around an hour. He told us that he was due to complete our job on Tuesday but was sent to the south coast for his first job and then to one in Surrey. Hardly surprising that he had no time to reach our property.  The waste of a day waiting for a visit was bad enough but to watch all that precious water running down the road for over 6 days very depressing.  Is it HomeServe systems or insufficient engineers. This is not the first time that HomeServe have disappointed us with issues with engineers. ,HomeServe
"I don't usually do reviews but I have used Homeserve before and they have always been reliable and done a great job. Everything is clear about what they do and don't cover. No hidden clauses. The guys do their utmost to fix the issue. One time  I had a water supply pipe leak under my garage floor, I had no idea where the leak was but they came out and sourced where it was, dug up the floor and fixed it. The reason I'm writing this review is because recently I got premium insurance with Home emergency Assist as it was cheaper and No call out fee but on reading the reviews it appeared they hide alot in the small print and one thing that came up a few times was that although they do cover water supply pipe leaks what wasn't covered was where they have to source and dig up where the leak is!!! This is not clear at all, it is apparently all in the small print and who really reads pages and pages of small print. I was so shocked I cancelled. Thank goodness I wasn't with them when it happened to me before. As I was with Homeserve I had paid just the call out fee of Ã‚Â£30 so it was well worth it. I just think Homeserve are a reliable company who you can trust and feel safe in the knowledge you're covered for every eventually!!",HomeServe
"I wouldn't choose anyone else but Homeserve now. In the past they have always come out promptly and fixed any problems. Recently I decided to use the company Home Emergency Assist because they were cheaper with a Ã‚Â£0 call out fee. But on reading the many reviews I realised that they hide alot in the small print and various things aren't covered so not really giving you peace of mind at all. It was quite worrying and I cancelled immediately and went back with Homeserve. The reason I'm writing this review is because one of the things I read in the reviews about "" Home Emergency Assist""  was that they say they cover water supply pipes yet...... they don't cover the sourcing of the leak and digging up...just the repair, so people were thinking they were insured but weren't!! I was shocked as it's really naughty to misguide people like that. I told the company they need to make it clearer to people, but I'm sure they won't.I had this same problem a few years back but I was with Homeserve ( thankfully!) and the engineers came out and spent alot of time and effort in locating the leak which was under my garage floor.. concrete..they emptied my garage ....it was full! They dug up the floor and fixed the leak and put everything back and all I had to pay was the callout fee which I think was Ã‚Â£30! They were absolutely delightful, brilliant and helpful, reassuring and took alot of stress off. They were both covered in mud and water but nothing was too much for them, they were intent on doing their job properly. I was blown away to be honest and should have written a review at the time.You can be assured with Homeserve that they don't hide stuff in the small print and are very clear about what is and isn't covered. Every engineer that has come out for problems I have had have been charming and helpful, nothing is too much. I have every faith in Homeserve and I certainly won't be going anywhere else again!! Plus Homeserve often do special deals which means it's not too expensive. If you want to feel safe and reassured if any problems arise I would definitely recommend Homeserve again and again, beware of other companies promising too good a deals because usually it's too good to be true as I found out!!",HomeServe
The immersion heater could not be fixed as the cylinder is leaking and needs to be replaced however the cold water tank is no longer overflowing.,HomeServe
"Two lovely chaps came out to resolve my blockage on the same day I called. Thank you Andy and Tony. Really cheerful and friendly.Had to call about a completely separate problem, water leak, a week later - this timeTony arrived. I was in a bit of a state as this had affected a neighbour.  But he was lovely and traced the leak problem and reassured me that all would be well.  Thank you.",HomeServe

"I reported a slow drip from a toilet and was given an appointment in 5 days for a ""non-urgent"" resolution which I could live with. Plumber came at appointed time and resolved the problem quickly and efficiently. I have used Homeserve in the past for more urgent problems and was happy with their response time then. Overall I am happy with the service they provide.",HomeServe
My initial call was answered quickly and an appointment was made promptly. The plumber let me know he was enroute and dealt with the problem within an hour. ,HomeServe

Leak in drive was difficult to find. A section of pipe was replaced by moling.  Only two small holes on drive.  Left in clean and tidy condition.,HomeServe
Very efficient as usual. Cistern like new!,HomeServe
"I had an overflow of the toilet. The initial engineer came and left with a different problem and said I needed a camera to check if there is a problem and I need to raise another job. I called customer service and explained the new issue created by the engineer they said itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the same job so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t  need to pay excess again. They sent out an engineer, who came and raised a job to put camera there wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a blockage but toilets systems needed good clean and a pipe needed refitting, this was done to high standard with good care so massive thank you to the 2nd engineer who came out and resolved the issue. ",HomeServe
Bit disappointed with originally given a week later appointment for a Blocked Toilet Drain but eventually given a next day call out and very happy and grateful to the two guys who worked like Trojans to get the problem found and fixed.,HomeServe
"Homeserve had sent a plumber in October 2023 to fix a leaking cold tap in the kitchen sink. Recently it began dripping again, so I asked Homeserve to come back and fix it under guarantee. They accepted the claim without hesitation and without charging the usual excess. Homeserve plumber Bogdan came on the appointed day and, without fuss, replaced both sink taps, hot and cold. Since he did not have a ""basic"" tap kit in his van, he fitted ""top end"" lever taps. The job took him one hour. Once again, very impressed with the Homeserve operation.",HomeServe
"Plumber arrived on time , then resolved the problems with professionalism whilst keeping me fully informed . Could not have gone any better",HomeServe
"This was a blocked pipe, The service was great, the engineer was quick and happy, not the best job to do! No pun intended! the area was left tidy when finished! Would definitely use again ",HomeServe
My toilet was blocked. It was a Sunday morning. I rang Homeserve and they arranged for a man to come and clear it between 12 and 6pm. He came at 2pm and quickly cleared it. Brilliant service . I would give 10 stars if I could.  Thank you so much.,HomeServe
they came the time they said fixed  the problem in no time which was a bad leak very pleased ,HomeServe
It would have been top marks. But the guy that did the repair should have checked it through. Then maybe there would never have been the need for a third visit. All for an air lock. Thank you. ,HomeServe
"The engineer who came to fix the problem was very polite, pleasant and straightaway got down to work. He identified the cause of the leek and over the next 45 minutes or so, managed to fix it, replacing the faulty part with new one which he had in his van. He seemed to have anticipated possible causes based on the problem I described over the phone and came well equipped to rectify any possible problems,   which he did. When he finished he left the area neat and tidy. I was very pleased with the work.",HomeServe
"HomeServe were very prompt with the offer of a plumber to visit to connect a new tap. The gentleman was very efficient, knew what he was doing and completed the task in a professional and timely manner.",HomeServe
Member of staff on the telephone was extremely helpful and sorted a date for the engineer to call. The engineer was good and informed us of the problem with the tap. He ordered the part and returned 3 days later. He did a quick efficient job.,HomeServe
Plumber Arrived on time and did a great job ( actually 2 jobs ) he covered his outdoor boots and was very courteous. Took no time at all replacing faulty mixer tap and new basin taps.......Didn't get his name but would highly recommend him and service he gave......... ,HomeServe
" Unfortunately I cannot give zero stars.Given a 12-6pm time slot and getting concerned when at 5.45pm I had heard nothing so called them. Eventually told that the engineer had Ã¢â‚¬Å“suffered a punctureÃ¢â‚¬Â ,was awaiting the AA but would still be attending but unfortunately had no idea when. Likely to be hours yet so I suggested rearranging but that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t practical because tomorrow they are fully booked. In the meantime, the leak continues!Apparently the puncture was some time ago so very disappointed not to have received a phone call to explain.update- eventually received a call from the engineer after10pm. No explanation.Having to reschedule.",HomeServe
"Gary who did the investigation to find the water leak and completed the respective repairs was phenomenal.  He kept us informed and answered all our questions.The company who were meant to come past the house afterwards to collect the rubble didn't complete the job, we will have to pay someone privately to complete the work.",HomeServe

However HomeServeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s service was efficient and their engineers were superb they did an excellent job, Sending a big Thank You to the enginerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who located and fixed the leaking drain. Excellent service HomeServe. ",HomeServe
Great service called first thing Monday morning and a young man came to look at what I thought was a leak. He checked everything out and the leak was caused by the sealant round the bath no longer working. A relief that it was nothing more serious. ,HomeServe
The visit went well and the two sets of taps had their problems corrected. What I found unbelievable was that I had to pay Ã‚Â£30 for each of the minor pieces of work conducted in the same visit. ,HomeServe
THEY MENDED SERIOUS WATER LEAK AND LEFT SITE CLEAN AND TIDY,HomeServe
The experience wasn't great. The problem was solved down side Ã‚Â£30 excess for a 20p washer. But that's life. They have resolved bigger issues previously and their response time is good. ,HomeServe

"I have had little need to use HomeServe despite being a customer for many years so when I did need urgent assistance I was disappointed to learn that my completely blocked drain could not be dealt with until the following week.

"HomeServe is best. The service is awesome. If any one is looking for plumbing and drainage coverage, I highly recommend Homeserve. ",HomeServe
We were not told that our policy did not cover repairs on the cylinder. So therefore after waiting twice for another engineer and needing to make numerous phone calls we had to take up another policy with some   another company to have it fixed. Please let us know when our policy is due to be renewed so I can cancel it. You need to be more transparent with your customers to make them aware what is not covered in there policy.,HomeServe
He hoovered the main pipe out then said everything will be okay now!! Famous last words because it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. The fault was still there so I had to call the dishwasher engineer out from Bosch,HomeServe
Plumber identified the problem immediately and resolved without delay. Very friendly and knowledgeable.,HomeServe
"Over all it was a 5.. just one remark made it lessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I gave a pressurised system for hot water and heating.. the boiler is on the top floor of a three storey house. It also has two expansion tanks, in the same cupboard.One of those fell off the wall!I have paid increasing amounts over the 10 years we have lived here.. and always had good service and knowledgeable workmenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ so I phoned and explained and was told to find a plumber!!!!! I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe it!Luckily I persevered and was put through to a repairs department and from then on all was well. It was a couple of weeks before the expansion tank was fully replaced.. but beyond theÃ‚Â£60 call out charge my new expansion tank was fitted very neatly and safely and I feel that I can now stay with  Homeserve.",HomeServe
"Very professional and friendly engineer. Checked our water system thoroughly and efficiently, and called our water company on behalf of us to explain the situation. Very helpful. ",HomeServe
They fixed a leak causing a bigger leak flooding the romm below through the light  fitting meaning I had no water for 23 hours until they fixed it.I had 3 different  engineers meaning I had to take 3 days off work.I have logged a formal complaint ,HomeServe

First class plumber polite nothing was to much trouble stacked the job in hand and completed it well also cleaned up after completion very well done,HomeServe
"Noticed a small stain on kitchen ceiling above very high cabinet in June. Phone homeserve pay Ã‚Â£30 excess and they send a Ã¢â‚¬ËœplumberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ out, Guy has a brief look at my bath which is right above kitchen and says the bath seals are leaking and need replacing that is not something homeserve do, replace seals and problem will be fixed.  I raised concerns it could be toilet leaking and he assured me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not. Have bath seals replaced and assume thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the end of it. August notice stain on ceiling looks bigger, call homeserve pay a second Ã‚Â£30 excess and another plumber is sent out. This plumber asks Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdid the first guy even run the bath taps as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your trap thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leakingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ replaced trap, advises to paint over stain with stain blocker and then paint kitchen ceiling and it will all be fine. Monday 30th September husband notices water coming through kitchen ceiling phone homeserve explain issue to call handler and state I believe bath needs to be taken out and floorboards lifted as can see damp under floorboards, he books plumber to attend Saturday 5th October between 8-6. Plumber arrives 3.40 and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the original plumber from June.  I will admit I was abrupt and did say to him you said it was seals and clearly it was not and leak wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fully investigated.  Guy looks under bath and flushed toilet. He agrees yes bath and floorboards need to be removed to locate leak, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbut I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do that today.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ When I ask why he states Ã¢â‚¬ËœitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a 2 man job and will take 6 hours, but it might not be the bath, it could be the toilet, so we will take a tile out there first before we move the bath to checkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (which remember he assured me it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t back in June, why he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t investigate Saturday if he thought it could be that I will never know), Ã¢â‚¬Ëœand when we take the bath out you will lose the bottom layer of tilesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (which no doubt he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t replace as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the fine print that the plumbers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put right why they have damaged, so of course I still wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to use my bath until I either replace the tiles myself or pay an actual competent plumber to come and replace them for me).He says he will phone office to book appointment and while he is doing that can he use the toilet.  I have already informed him we have not used bathroom for a week as we are worried about leak getting worse, so he said I can use the one downstairs. Guy is on hold for 14 minutes by which time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 3.58 and he says oh theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not answering I can book it for Monday 14th October and if you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait that long you can call and try and bring it forward.  I still have water dripping through ceiling at this point, so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not really prepared to wait another week for appointment.  I also explain I have a physically disabled child who finds going downstairs tricky so I really do need my family bathroom repaired. Phone homeserve Sunday morning and explain situation, call handler finds appointment for Tuesday afternoon 12-6 which he books for two men and assures me they will be here at start of slot as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a 6 hour job. 2.30 today I receive a call from the office the appointment has been booked incorrectly and no one is coming today it will take two men 8 hours to carry out the repair and they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t send anyone until 14th October. Again, honestly, I was abrupt and stated itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unacceptable. I have water coming through my kitchen ceiling, which is bowed and stained and will need replacing once the leak is finally found and repaired, and we are unable to use the main bathroom in the house. Amazingly the call operative found an appointment for Friday morning 8-10am, who knows what will happen on Friday as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve only been allocated 2 hours for what has now been logged as an 8 hour job! By the time the plumber comes on Friday (if they do come) I will have taken 4 days off of work to wait for plumbers to visit, I will not have been able to confidently use by main bathroom for 2 weeks and I need to replace my kitchen ceiling which still has water coming through and has damaged the kitchen cabinet underneath. I feel the engineer has overestimated the time it will take to locate the leak as a way of manipulating labour costs. Also my bathroom has a floor space of no more than 1.5m square so I fail to see how two full grown men are going to be able to fit in the bathroom and carry out the work.  I am hugely disappointed with the service we have received.  I have submitted a formal complaint but have no confidence it will be dealt with appropriately so am going to be contacting the financial ombudsman and will be seeking compensation for the lost days working and also to replace my kitchen ceiling.  Apparently after posting a comment on homeserve social medial pages the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhere to helpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ team have escalated my complaint to the customer relations team and a dedicated case handler will be contacting me as soon as possible to discuss, again I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have high hopes for any satisfactory resolution from homeserve.",HomeServe
Absolutely superb. Always arrived on time explained everything and gave reassurance that they can fix the bad leak in my garden and did what another major company couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Very happy. ,HomeServe
Paid the Ã‚Â£30 excess. Plumber couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even be bothered to get down on his knee at the cistern to investigate the leak. Told me I needed a new toilet because of it having silicon on the tiles instead of being screwed in. Got another plumber in who fixed the job in 10 mins. Had to pay an additional Ã‚Â£70! ,HomeServe
We was happy with the speed in which Homeserve attended and finally getting things resolved. Slight negative was that the first plumber gave us another problem to resolve and also the demeanour of one staff member lacked empathy to our situation. He was also reluctant to do some basic removal of floor boards which I would have been happy to sign the disclaimer for like I did with the first visit for any damage caused. But I was happy with the overall service and glad we have this cover. ,HomeServe
Excellent service our leaking tap was replaced with a new one in the space of a few hours following our call to Homeserve to inform them of the probled,HomeServe
"A noisy discharge from my kitchen sink turned out to be a real head scratcher, the determination of the three plumbers to find a solution was most commendable, in particular was Barry whose dogged determination and keenest to get the problem sorted resulted in the release of a patialay blocked ,incorrectly installed pipe, probably years worth of residue. A fantastic result from a thoroughly professional  team.",HomeServe
The service we receive from you Home service ukWas Excellent the fitter turned up on time he replaced 2 rubber flexi pipes in a short period replaced the basin on the sink would recommend Home service to everyone thank you.,HomeServe
"Very inpressed with the service.  I called Homeserve due to a leaking tap. I got a quick appointment and the plumber came, assessed the problem and ordered the parts.  A few days later I got the parts direct from the supplier and 2 plumbers came and fixed the problem the day after.  It involved having to open up a wall and this was done carefully, efficiently and quickly.  The wall needs to be made good by ourselves or by calling a plasterer but it was to be expected. ",HomeServe
My booking ref. CAS1034008 not sot still been completed.   There was twice postponed during to non availability of engineers.  I did took day off and waited for the engineer with no fruit.   Both my toilet taps are inoperable and I had closed shut.  I cannot afford to take day off again.  Ver poor customer service on 20th September and again on 2nd October. ,HomeServe
"The toilet flusher was replaced,  however, now the water in the toilet is extremely low. You don't get the chance to call homeserve unless you raise another claim.",HomeServe
"Did not turn up on selected day, arrived next day instead. Plumber was very good though.",HomeServe
"Engineer great ..BUT booking would have been easier with direct contact to person and not robot.Leak was dealt with but no fault of engineer there is no follow up system to install new parts, which then needs contact with other plumbers",HomeServe
"The plumber who was called out was very polite, very efficient and the job was finished very promptly without any fuss. Perfect.",HomeServe
"After a drama involving an emergency water escape I had to complain to Homeserve and I have been very pleased with the considerate way I have been dealt with, and the understanding I have been given. Thank you to Chris. ",HomeServe
The only concern was the time it took for a drain crew to arrive.  I am 71 and I was without a toilet for 14hrs.   ,HomeServe
Engineer knew what he was doing and after assessing where the  blockage was he soon had the toilet drain flowing free again.Cant' speak too highly of your engineer and expertisehe showed in dealing with the problemThank you,HomeServe
I was offered a good choice of appointments and chose one for the next day. The plumber arrived very promptly and did a very good job quickly and efficiently.,HomeServe
"I arranged for a repair visit to fix a leaking tap valve. The engineer arrived and told me he couldn't fix it because it's a filter tap. The tap has three handles and one of those is for filtered water and unfortunately this is the one with the leak. The engineer said he could have fixed it if it was one of the other handles but not the one supplying filtered water! I happen to know that the replacement part for the filter handle is identical to the part for the cold tap handle.I couldn't understand his reasoning for not fixing it. I did later look at the policy wording which has no mention of filter taps - although I did eventually find it in the general conditions document. Shouldn't it be in the policy wording? I suppose I can understand the filter system not being included in the insurance - but surely a tap handleÃ‚Â is a tap handle regardless of what it's connected to under the sink?The engineer phoned his office so that they would confirm with him that he wasn't allowed to do a repair. They offered to replace my Franke filter tap with a ""standard"" tap. I've no idea what sort of tap that would be. I told the engineer that filter taps are quite expensive and should be repairable. In any case, surely the work involved in changing a complete tap is more than taking off a handle and switching a valve?So, I feel annoyed that Homeserve have wasted my time. I'm somewhat relieved that I'm currently paying the offer price for Plumbing & Drains insurance. Of course I won't be renewing at the full price.Ã‚Â  I wonder how many other things that they are supposed to cover have hidden exceptions.",HomeServe
Sean was a great guy. He explained everything and was very attentive to all aspects of the work. No problems whatsoever and did a great job fixing a leak and replacing a tap. Highly recommended ,HomeServe
"I had a water tap under sink that was stuck solid. The engineer came, put in a new tap connection and also an isolation valve in as well. All done in 45 minutes. He checked with me that the connection worked before leaving",HomeServe
Quick response for plumbing problem. Plumber arrived during time expected after phoning first. Very quickly knew what the problem was. To rectify would have meant removal of tiles from bath panel which I was reluctant to do. We agreed the best thing was to use an ordinary bath plug which he sorted out for me. Thank you.,HomeServe
Home service was good they fixed my leaking tap BUT they left the waste pipe leaking ,HomeServe
"The job was to take place between 0800 and 1800. I waited in all day and then at 1745 took a phone call to say it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happening that day as the technician had been delayed on another job. A new book was arranged for another day when I would be first on the list. During that call I told the operator that I had a tap that had started dripping, that I had a replacement cartridge and wandered that could be fixed at the same time. I was told that wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be a problem. When the technician arrived at 0930 on the day of the booking I told him about the tap and was told it would not be possible to do the tap as it was not on his job sheet. This meant he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been given the time to do that work. Also he would not be covered if anything went wrong with the cartridge replacement. When he finished the pipe replacement he sat in my driveway for 10 minutes or more before moving on for his next job. ",HomeServe
"Boiler health, plumber very nice and professional. Explained things. Blocked drain, again a very good service with 2 nice helpful lads. Fixed my problem. Thanks. Recommended home service to my sister, and she too has joined. So thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good ",HomeServe
"The engineer had a difficult problem to deal with, because of pipework that needed replacing, but he tackled it with imagination and skill - and good humour. It couldn't have been done any better.",HomeServe
The employees were very helpful and worked hard to find the leak. Unfortunately my appointment was cancelled twice. ,HomeServe
"Telephoned with problem operator was very efficient dealt with call with curtesy and allocated attendance by plumber as an emergency, plumber arrived within two hours and dealt with issue, very impressed.",HomeServe
"Engineer was very polite and very professional, however, only to tell me where leak was coming from and homeserve do not fix the problem. I will have to claim on my home insurance. Is this what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m paying Ã‚Â£25 a month for. Will be deciding to cancel or not as really donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think this is the cover IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking for.",HomeServe
PlUmber did it very  well,HomeServe
Phone call answered quickly and an appointment made. Plumber arrived during the time range specified and repaired leaking pipe.

Same day serviceVery clean after visit all old items were removed and plumber was very polite. ,HomeServe
The plumbers repaired the leaking pipe and taps quickly and efficiently.,HomeServe
"Making the claim was straightforward. The customer service person was helpful and the plumber was booked in. I was told by a builder that my toilet was leaking and water was going into my wall, which I believed even though I couldn't see any water around the loo. The plumber came and checked thoroughly. There was no leak. The plumber explained how it wasn't a leak and that condensation from hot and cold water pipes were causing the wall to be wet. It was a relief to know that.",HomeServe

"The system and process worked efficiently and I got an appointment in a timely fashion.HOWEVER, my appointment slot was 12 noon to 6.00pm. I was told I would get a call from the plumber when he was ""on his way"". I waited and waited, I got no call. He just turned up at about 4.30pm.he was polite, quick and efficient, but the overall experience would have been so much better if I had a call as promised.",HomeServe
"I was so impressed with the service from homeserve , I phoned on the Thursday and explained my kitchen tap was dripping , normally my husband would have changed the washer , unfortunately the new design taps donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have washers .The appointment was made for an engineer to call the next day which he did, a new tap was installed , canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t praise them and the engineer enough , fantastic service ",HomeServe

"We had a problem with water leaking down a wall and door frame of our sitting-room and our builder could not locate the source despite pulling up floorboards. So we asked Homeserve to come out and a very impressive engineer, Matt, located the leak through finding a fault with the new bath taps that none of us had spotted. So we were delighted with this service.",HomeServe
"I received a 5 star service in terms fixing my water tapsThe plumber Ã°Å¸ÂªÂ  was professional, efficient, polite, and really listened.",HomeServe
"The initial contact and booking of an engineer's visit worked very well. However, I was not as happy with the visiting engineer's  attitude.  He said he could not find evidence of a leak from the hot water tank in the airing cupboard. This was true, although there was water staining on the floor surrounding the tank. He said this was most likely the result of poorly fitted shower pump.He also indicated some bad repairs at the top of the cylinder ?? He implied that I was trying to get a new cylinder just because it was old.  I did not like his implication. He left with out recommending any further action. I was disappointed as all previous contacts and work by Homeserve have been very satisfactory. My continuing concern is off a catastrophic leak.",HomeServe
Very helpful plumber. Fixed the taps using his materials and new tap heads. Clean and neat worker,HomeServe

"The engineer was very  prompt with his arrival and work, there is a slight problem! The replaced flushing lever when in use bangs the cistern lid! This is rather loud at late night use!!",HomeServe
"An engineer came out on Sunday 22 September 2024 to check the leak in my bathroom.  Immediately he said it was the sealant around the bath that caused the problem and that ""Homeserve did not cover that!.  He spent around 5 minutes maybe less inside telling me that this was the problem and he did not even check any pipes or anything under the bath.  He then went to his van parked outside and sat there for around half an hour or more.  I had to call a plumber out who checked under the bath, tested the pipes, ran the water and said it was not the sealant it was the bath waste pipe - so I assume this WAS COVERED BY HOMESERVE and I obviously had to pay the plumber so I had to pay for something that was clearly covered by Homeserve and I am very angry, disappointed and not at all impressed.",HomeServe
A very helpful plumber who explained the situation ,HomeServe
"We had a blocked drain which was reported to HomeServe. I was amazed at how prompt the service was. The engineer was on our premises in rapid time and  although he could not rectify the problem for us, he reported the fault to Yorkshire Water as the blockage was not on our property. Later on in the afternoon an engineer from Yorkshire Water came and rectified the fault. Fantastic service from both HomeServe and Yorkshire Water, thank you so much!",HomeServe
"Great plumber, super efficient and friendly. CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fault Sam ",HomeServe
"We called Homeserve on a Saturday to report a problem with our kitchen tap, they came to fix the problem on the following Wednesday. The plumber who came (Zak? - from Durham) was marvellous,  polite and good humoured. He carried out the work to the highest standard,  replaced the tap and made sure we were happy with the work before he left. The only minor irritant in the process was the annoying AI chatbot that you speak to when reporting the fault but the job got done well,  so that's what matters. ",HomeServe
"The plumber who attended was excellent.Booking the repair was completely machine based, and gave no possibility of discussing what might be needed; an option to speak to a person would be an improvement.",HomeServe

The gentleman that came to fix my leaking tap was very courteous & helpful and did a great job as tap couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be fixed but luckily I had a spare one which he installed in record time.,HomeServe
"Gentleman who came was very good. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shame about the rubbish taps you supplied that he had to come and wind tape around to stop the tap from flying off and drowning the work tops with water every so often. You need to change to quality taps, and if it happens again you will get the bill for decent taps and a private plumber to fit them.",HomeServe

Really glad I have my Homeserve Plumbing Cover. This has been in place for almost 25 years and a lifesaver or at least a 'mess saver'. Recently I had a late night burst and a lovely Homeserve engineer drove 4 hours in the early morning to sort us out. We have had a few call outs over the years and really appreciated our Homeserve Cover. We will definitely continue this. Worth every penny.,HomeServe

"I rang Homeserve in September saying precisely that my TWO DRAINAGES are partly blocked. Homeserve said it would cost 30.00, which I paid. After few days an Engineer came and clean only one drainage, saying he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t clean other drainage as he has another job to go to. He said other Engineer will come and clean the other drainage definitely. Other Engineer didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come,so I rang Homeserve and they asked for Ã‚Â£30.00. If Homeserve would have said this in the beginning, I would not have went ahead. I feel cheated. I complained by Email, but I still havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t received any response.I would be extremely grateful if you would look into this and arrange for another Engineer.",HomeServe

No-one turned up at the appointed time. Finally got an appt two days later. Very pleasant young man but made very little difference to the flow of the bath/basin waste. We know we have a very shallow drop from the bath - also evident that a quick hoover around the plughole is not worth the annual premium. Seems no point in renewing.,HomeServe
The job was fine for a few hours and then another leak developed from under tap we decided to get someone else to look at the problem ,HomeServe
"new tap was fitted , all works well , the only down side was I waited several days for an appointment , I changed my routine , then the appointment got cancelled so I had to reschedule another day for when a plumber was available, I do work so this was a bit annoying .The plumber was helpful and polite.",HomeServe

I'm so pleased and would recommend anyone get this cover, we have just had to have our supply pipe into the house replaced and all it's cost us is the excess on the policy ",HomeServe
Excellent as always. Although they were booked up in my area they still came out and assessed the next day. Replacement stoptap day after. ,HomeServe

Our downstairs toilet stopped working. I am disabled and with a lung disease and cannot go upstairs to use the toilet there. Homeserve were super. They arranged an emergency appointment over the weekend and sorted the problem out within hours. ,HomeServe

The plumber was very helpful and got the job done.,HomeServe
"A guy came to my house to inspect and fix a leak. He was here for just a few minutes, briefly pointed out the potential problem area, and then told me to hire a builder to fix it! And I still ended up paying Ã‚Â£30 for this so-called service!",HomeServe
"Had water leak in bedroom ceiling.Called at 7.30,plummer came by 11.00.Excellent sevice,fault found,repaired in 20mins.Both Homeserve and employee first class.",HomeServe
The plumber didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show knowledge and experience in fixing leaking pipes below the bath tub.He faced challenge s in accessing pipes and in the process scratched the wooden panel on the side of the tub. On a positive note the problem was solved. ,HomeServe
"Making the appointment with Homeserve was easy; they kept me upto date with a change of times.the engineer was extremely knowable and very experienced, he was able to free the stopcock and offered valuable advice gong forward.",HomeServe

"Plumber arrived promptly, gave prior warning, was polite friendly and helpful. Worked tidily and efficiently - checked work was completed satisfactorily before leavingAlways found Homeserve provide good plumbers",HomeServe
"Our problem wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t solved.  We have a very annoying noise in our plumbing, I had recorded it for you two plumbers to listen to.  Having since be on quite a few plumbing forums- itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s looking like we need a new toilet cistern although there are other things it could be, like a washer in taps  so on & so on.  None of these were considered.  So no not happy with the 2nd visit.  Still got the noise.  ",HomeServe
Unexpected leak in the pipes connecting to the boiler. Went on the Homeserve app and booked the first available appointment. Engineer came as planned and repaired the leaking pipe. Absolutely peace of mind as sometimes the leaking pipes are hard to repair and Homeserve engineers are better equipped to get these jobs done. ,HomeServe
Excellent service from arranging emergency call out to the polite and professional plumber.,HomeServe
"Very helpful on livechat to get my problem resolved. Excellent young man who fixed the toilet, clean and tidy job! Great service all round! Have been with homeserve for a few years now and it's really worth it when you get problems. Many thanks.",HomeServe
CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t comment as still waiting for work to be completed on a mains water leak 3 weeks on from original start date of work! Very disappointing indeed. ,HomeServe
The repair had been a problem because of limited space in the mechanism of the toilet to make the repair.  However the plumber was excellent as he had the right sized arms and hands and managed it easily.,HomeServe
"After having no water and no heating for 3 1/2 days we eventually had someone who wanted to help us ( the last one walked in , said canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do that and he walked back out!!!! ). Well this plumber fitter has just saved this firms reputation. Mr Conner Kyle is a fantastic person who cares about people and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t walk off of the job until he had mended 3 pipes and replaced the stop tap. He is a first class fitter and a very nice caring person. Conner has saved the reputation of this company, as going 3 days with no water or heating was not nice! He couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand why we were left in the situation we were in, he found the problems and mended all of them. Thank you Conner you are a credit to your profession. ",HomeServe
"Customer service were very helpful and understanding. The plumber who came out to me was friendly, helpful and very understanding also. He managed to fix my problem straightaway. Fantastic job. Thank you ",HomeServe

I phoned Sat morning and the plumber jack came in the afternoon What prompt service He was professional and thorough Well done homeserve glad o am with you ,HomeServe
"Terrible experience, plumber just couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be bothered. He really was just trying to tick boxes to go into the next job . Eg we had no stop cock connected & couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t identify where the leak was coming from . It was the old scenario of stood there scratching his head . In short he just didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to do the repair and said it was a 2 man job . The information he gave us about our issue was untrue. We have bought in an independent plumber to solve our issue and he actually knew what he was talking about and solved the issue on his own . You pay a lot of money for a terrible service The crack was not the cause of the leak as outlined by your plumber , and if he had assessed the call out and actually looked he would have seen this . The leak was from the water pipe and this leak could have been stopped if the plumber could have been bothered to check the fitting . The stop cock all he had to do was remove the fitting and would have discovered it. The plumber we called in solved the issue of the leak and removed the toilet within 30 mins . No more leaking from the water inlet pipe connection . We were not offered any assistance to stop the leak , but told he would have to rebook with 2 plumbers to remove the toilet and to investigate further. He also told us that if the toilet was removed the stench from the waste pipe would be unbearable to leave with , this is totally untrue. We have had the toilet removed and because of the hight of the waste pipe , a few plastic bags have sealed the pipe and no smell . Your plumber needs retaining and to learn about basic customer service.  ",HomeServe
The plumber came when booked and kept me informed about his arrival. He quickly diagnosed the problem and sorted it easily.,HomeServe
We found a dry water stain on the kitchen plasterboard wall. We had a friendly plumber arrive who discussed our options after doing a visual check. We agreed to having an investigation by cutting into the plasterboard. Pipes were immediately found and wadding was wet so leak was identified so the cause was hunted out. Leak from a hot water pipe which was fixed.A large hole was created which is not covered by Homeserve. So leak was fixed but damaged caused by investigation and repair was a few hundred more by a different trader.,HomeServe
Excellent service they came out same day to unblock toilet for my elderly mother ,HomeServe
"Excellent, prompt service, problem reported and resolved in 6 hours. Plumber was friendly, efficient and professional. Well done !!",HomeServe
Excellent service plumber arrived in time job absolutely perfect canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fault highly recommend ,HomeServe
"When they actually came the work and service from the plumbers was amazing, couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fault them. However the admin team were rude and unhelpful. Had a slot of 1-6 on a Friday, I was called at 5.30 to say no one was coming, no apology or sympathy for my situation they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care less that much would have to wait over the weekend. Thankfully the two plumbers that came were so good and helpful as they made up for the poor admin team. And I understand this is a standard issue from talking to friends.maybe some customer service training is needed!! ",HomeServe
The engineer arrived on time. He was pleasant and stated what was wrong. He fixed the blockage in 15 mins!,HomeServe
Responded very quickly to a toilet that wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flush - my only toilet and with terminal cancer I needed help fast . I rang them 9.00pm in the evening and by 9.30 the next morning it was all fixed by replacing the inlet valve . ,HomeServe
"Drainage engineer Scott listened to me, formulated a plan and soon discovered the offending tree root. He managed to jet this through, andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦hopefullyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦problem solved.",HomeServe

"Ã¢â‚¬Å“DazÃ¢â‚¬Â attended to our blocked drain, outstanding service, good communication prior to punctual arrival, very thorough and a clear desire to resolve the issue regardless of time required. Usual reliable HomeServe service and Daz is a credit to the company. Would highly recommend.",HomeServe
Problem 1. Electrical fault reported in January. Visited in February to half do the job. Left to source parts... never returned.. gave up in September and had the job done privately.Problem 2. Reported an internal sink and shower blockage. Took a day off work to be sent an external drainage expert to do my job. He said he didn't have the tools to do my job and left.Waste of a day's annual leave. Waste of my time.I have been compensated.BUT it is a derisory offer when you take into account the 2 x excess payments I made and the 3 annual leave days I had to take to wait indoors for each visit.On a foot note I even had my second plumbing issue cancelled 2 hours into the expected visit time. I phoned and complained and miraculously you found a plumber to attend within 2 hours.Sadly it's been disappointing Ã°Å¸ËœÅ¾ ,HomeServe
"Had a leak with the toilet which was dealt with very promptly and to satisfaction, ",HomeServe
"Excellent plumber who arrived on time and did a great job. He was courteous and very helpful, answered all our questions and gave good advice.",HomeServe
Easy to make appointments plumber was brilliant would recommend homeserve to everyone ,HomeServe
Your engineer was very helpful and patient in sorting out my leaking sink. He arrived on time and sorted out what turned out to be quite a difficult problem.,HomeServe
"We had water leaking onto a bathroom shower switch. Didn't know the source. I placed a call to Homeserve, an engineer arrived within 1 hour, located the problem and gave clear advice on what to do next. Very reassuring. Would recommend Homeserve. ",HomeServe
"From booking my engineer to him arriving and fixing my drain problem was so quick and easy, and this was all done in one day.",HomeServe
"Although it took a few visits (first one using pressure device to clear drains, second one doing the same but also investigating with camera and third one digging up part of sewer and relacing) I am so grateful for the thorough job that was done. Hate to think what this would've cost if I didn't have the cover.",HomeServe
Returned from holiday to a leaking toilet. Rang in the morning and plumber arrived by midday. Completed the repair in 2 hours. All excellent,HomeServe
A very simple process of signing up for plumbing emergency repairs. Got given a new discounted starter offer which is wonderful! Easy process to fill out and quick!,HomeServe
Initial call for help was a tad difficult. I had a leak that was evidenced by the pressure dial on my boiler. I made the mistake of saying I was losing pressure due to a leak somewhere. The lady on the phone tried to tell me my boiler was the problem and that wasn't covered by my insurance. I had to say 'let me re-phrase that' and said I'm calling about a leak. Only then did she organise a plumber to visit.The plumber was great. He arrived as scheduled and fixed the LEAK on a radiator that was causing the pressure to drop. All over in 20 or 30 minutes.,HomeServe
The plumber turned up on time and and isolated the problem with the water leak in the toilet bowl and immediately went about changing the washer seal. There was a lot of limescale build up underneath the rim which he did his best to to remove. He then tidied up and left.I would recommend HomeServe for peace of mind in case anything unexpected happens in the home.,HomeServe
I have been waiting for 2 days fir a call to book a courtesy visit to my house fir a drainage issue ,HomeServe
"Our Kitchen sink mono block was leaking. Called home serve and dealt with a Bot,  now I can honestly say this is the only Bot that has ever ever worked the way it should.  Appointment booked for the next morning, the plumber identified the problem and ordered the parts from Franke. He booked a follow up appointment for the following Friday when the parts had been delivered to our address. Had a call from the call center to confirm the parts had been ordered and appointment confirmed. The following appointment plumber contacted she was on route and arrived 15 mins later. Mono block fixed and works as new. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how good companies are until you need the.Homeserve you were excellent from start to finish, 10 out of 10 if I could give you 11 i would. ",HomeServe
"initially a little concerned in that we had been given a time and date to clear our drainage blockage only to receive a further phone call shortly afterwards trying to change the date and time. We were not happy with this as the drains,toilets etc were totally blocked.Saturday afternoon arrived as did the gentleman from Homeserve in the allocated time frame.Having assessed the situation he said that he did not know why he had been sent to us as he was a plumber and clearly we needed a drainage engineer. All was not lost as he quickly organised a colleague to attend with all the necessary equipment.The engineer arrived within the hour and the two men worked together to resolve the situation. To be honest they were excellent, nothing was tooo much trouble for them and they quickly resolved the situation.A camera was also used to determine the condition of the outlet pipe and 20 m from the back of the house it was apparent a tree root was the source of causing the blockage.In summary the guys were excelllent and the issue was resolved. There may be a re-occurrence if the root continues to develop.",HomeServe
Very pleased with how quickly the toilet leak problem was sorted out,HomeServe
"I recently had a blocked drain in my bathroom, so checked my cover and gave Homeserve a call. I was pleasantly surprised to be offered a same day appointment. The engineer phoned in advance, fixed the problem immediately and advised I had another issue which would be covered. I called back and booked a second repair for the next day, which was fixed. Overall very impressed.",HomeServe
"Very happy with HomeServe service,had leaking tap which was fixed by HomeServe plumber very professionaly",HomeServe
We had a problem with our toilet not flushing properly.  My wife's wrist had been broken and made the problem worse! Our Homeserve Engineer did a marvellous job and had to almost dismantle the mechanism and now it works better than ever.  So pleased with a job well done.,HomeServe
"Answered the phone quickly! Polite , friendly & very helpful. Plumber was out within 2 hrs- also friendly , very knowledgeable, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave a mess. Always great service from Homeserve - thank you !",HomeServe
Engineer scheduled for between 8am and 1pmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.no contact by 1pm called only to be lied to - stating that they had tried to call me and text me the day before to state the date had been rearrangedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I did have a text the day before but it was confirming my original appointment time. Eventually spoke to a supervisor and got an engineer out later that day - however he was a contractor and stated that the leak issue was not covered by my policyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a washer on our dishwasher hoseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦however it was clearly stated in my policy that it was covered. Eventually got it fixed but the whole issue was a disaster. Made a complaint at the time but still not heard back from them some 2 weeks later,HomeServe
Had water leak in tank in the loft told by your plumber that as it was incorrectly installed not covered by our plan.Tank was installed 13 years ago and has been ok until now. As due to age and being disabled I am unable to access the loft and check if this is so but I am not happy at having to pay another plumber to correct the problem.,HomeServe
"Helpful and calm customer service over the phone after I'd just had a pipe burst. The plumber sent (from Hastings I believe) was friendly and thorough, making sure that everything was up and running and tidy before he left. ",HomeServe

"After a leak developed under our outside path, we phoned Home serve who arrived the next day and quickly fixed the problem.No quibble, no fuss, just a great service! ",HomeServe
"As it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an emergency as such, I waited a couple of days before the engineer arrived. He covered his shoes before entering and fixed the leak very efficiently, tidying up behind him. He was polite, efficient, tidy and very responsive to any questions I asked.",HomeServe
"Called homeserve at 9am due to a leak on a water tank and they were with me by 12.30!The engineer who came was friendly and had me sorted out within an hour, fixing the leak which was in quite a tight location to work in. Brilliant service, thank you.",HomeServe
Plumber came on time and did the repair efficiently.,HomeServe
The guys who fixed my plumbing problem were brilliant. They turned up when they said they would and they didn't leave until they were certain that the problem was fixed. Excellent service.,HomeServe
"I called because we had a blocked pipe from the bath , the guy came changed the pipe because he said was higher than the trap, I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see how this could be true has we havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t had a problem before , anyway after changing the pipe , this didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t solve the problem ( I could have told him that ) he decided to put a rod down to see if there was a blockage , he then said he could do it because the rod wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t long enough , so would send someone on Monday with the right tools , in the mean time I put some drain unblocker down , fixed it, he probably did help by pushing it along maybe , but waste of time changing pipes .",HomeServe
"James, the plumber, did an excellent job of fixing our very old toilet. He is very knowledgeable, polite, and worked very hard. ",HomeServe
The workman was polite and communicated very well with me. He said the tap had to be replaced and showed me the replacement tap which was very acceptable. He replaced it efficiently without any damage.,HomeServe
"I'm disappointed that my plan doesn't cover leaking valves on pipes leading to the boiler as the boiler manufacturer states they are not part of the boiler, but are part of the house's water supply system.",HomeServe
Plumber arrived  on time but was unable to carry out any work on shower mixer valve as not in contract.,HomeServe
We had a leak in the shower pump which was turned off. Leak in hot water tank not spotted. Moreover it appeared that Homeserve had no responsibility for replacing the shower pump. Ã‚Â£165 per year with a Ã‚Â£30 call out fee is beginning to look expensive.,HomeServe
"The help desk were very sympathetic to our problem. They liaised with their team and arranged a call out the same evening (we had water dripping through the ceiling!). When the plumber arrived, he was assured, confident he could sort us out and considerate of our property. We couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fault him. ",HomeServe
"This is the second time I've had to use Homeserve, and I can't fault their service in any way. I had a blocked drain outside the house and contacted homeserve. They took all my details and then had an engineer out the same day. Outstanding service.",HomeServe
"I had an excellent rÃƒÂ©ponse to a cold water overflow problem. Within days I had a person round to fix the problem replacing non-working parts, a very pleasant and efficient guy and have had no problems since. Thanks for a wonderful service.",HomeServe
"Obviously, a significantly blocked drain was a matter of concern & your friendly HomeServe operative on secondment from Wigan, did a brilliant & very efficient procedure to clear the foul pipe. Very pleased!",HomeServe
"Plumber arrived, carried out repair efficiently. Clean and tidy",HomeServe
I was pleased with the swift call to my call regarding a toilet leak.  Despite the plumber initially saying it was probably a cracked system he managed to fix the leak... however after he left I found the toilet flush was weak .. it's better now but still not right...I shall keep an eye on it ,HomeServe
"The drain pipe was blocked, they done great job,  thank you ",HomeServe
"Your technician was very knowledgeable, courteous, and helpful. He quickly ascertained the problem and, to my surprise, sucked the blockage from the waste pipe instead of rodding it which is what I expected we would do, and explained the reason for not rodding. He also explained the problems of using commercial unblockers which was a piece of very helpful information that I will take on board.The reason for 4 stars instead of five is because the technician did not arrive on the day that was originally promised. There was an attempt to cover it up by claiming that he called, to let me know he was coming, but didn't get an answer. I indeed had a 'silent call' on the landline that day, but there was no attempt to call my mobile number, and it is in contradiction to the message I later received from the office (which was subsequently removed!?), apologizing for being unable to service the call and booking the visit for the following day. This sort of miscommunication has an impact on trust that I have in the company. ",HomeServe
Great first contact plumber arrived on time and did a very good job thanks Bob Blamey,HomeServe
"When I contacted you, I needed a drip in my toilet fixed and a dripping bathroom tap.When your service man came he only had the dripping tap on his order form, which he couldn't do because I should have had a replacement tap for him to fix.However, that morning my shower taps broke and there was water everywhere. Your service man came to my rescue and was able to isolate the shower so that I could use water in the rest of the house, for which I am eternally grateful.",HomeServe
The Homeserve plumber who addressed the problem and left us with a better operating system than we had for a while.,HomeServe
"I was kept updated on the appointment day and time via a number of text messages, which pleased me since I have a forgetful memory. There were problem leaks with two difference taps, so I quite gladly paid the excess for the two jobs when I made the initially enquiry with the very helpful phone person. The plumber, Jo, was polite, professional and articulately explained what was needed and what he was going to do to repair the issue. It was not a straight forward job, but Jo knew his way around everything to do with plumbing, and he installed me classy replacement taps and fixed the pipes that were causing the issue. It is reassuring that Homeserve employ excellent plumbers who know their stuff. Having two properly functioning, non-leaking taps, made me ridiculously happy.",HomeServe
"Plumber telephoned in advance, arrived at correct time and completed work in a professional and seemly manner. I left plumber to work on his own and although he completed the job, when he finished he did not tell me or ask me to see what had been done or if it was to my satisfaction.Although the original requested work was completed I can still hear a slight drip in the cistern.",HomeServe
"Water was pouring through my kitchen ceiling. Bucket on kitchen floor and jugs in the bathroom under the cistern. The cistern was leaking badly. I was down as an emergency but I waited 18 hours for the repair man to arrive. Not his fault, he did a great job. It was the fault of bad management and administration. I couldn't use my kitchen lights as water was pouring through them. Cooking dinner by torch light. Not good enough.",HomeServe

I will take take their advice and find a plumber, who will fit a pump.

"Please don't use this company as they don't have skilled people and they might make your life more misserable by creating more issues to the existing one.So this happened on 5th October, an engineer came to look at our toilet as there was a small leakage inside. When he came, he opened the flush tank and tried to change a part. He couldn't change anything. so he tried to take some photos. He took the silicone off and moved the toilet. After few minutes, he went to his van and was in a call for a while with someone. When he came back, he broght a vaccum cleaner and cleaned that part. He told me that my old plumber who installed the toilet didn't do the job properly and told me not to use the toilet. He said Homeserve will install a new toilet within 2 days. After this, he came down and asked me to sign on his screen. Just after he left, I checked the toilet and saw that the toilet was broken on a side. The broken piece was also taken away by him. Then I realised why he was hoovering with a vaccum cleaner. After few day, I didn't hear from Homewerve so we contacted them and they said in engineer's note, he wrote that the toilet was already broken when he got there. Therefore,they can't do anything from there side. So, I would definitley won't recommend this company to anyone as they don't have trained professional guys to do the repair. Its difficult to trust their work. Also i made a complain with them and its been almost 2 weeks and i am still waiting for them to respond. So please dont use this company . Intially i recommended this company to few of my friends and family and now i have asked them not to use there service. We really cant trust this company.",HomeServe

"The water flow from the tap in the kitchen was awful, so slow, I was told this is because it is the furthest from the tank but used to be much faster flow.The plummer advised I could get the system flushed but as every other tap is fine wasn't sure this would do anything so seems a waste of time.He did replace the tap and it is improved but still not great.",HomeServe
"Dripping Taps and constant running toilet system.Homeserve plumbers attended over two days. Toilet flush system completely replaced. Very efficient plumber including a new thumbscrew stop tap, now works better than new Following day another plumber attended, replaced the taps in the outside utility, at last taps that turn on easily and turn off without constant dripping, but best of all 'barrel' washers replaced in kitchen, no longer dripping running and making the pipes rattle when anyone has a bath or a shower, thanks you Homeserve - both really clean, tidy and efficient plumbers.",HomeServe

Plumber spent one hour changing parts that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need replacing. DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix the leak! Another hour of work reducing length of a pipe that had been fine for 20 years. Sawed a metal pipe in bathroom. Swarf in mats! Second plumber very aggressive in defending the work. Could have been intimidating for some folks.,HomeServe
By about 9 am on a Sunday my blocked drain was sorted. Very impressed- excellent service.,HomeServe
"Excellent service the Plumber turned up on time, was very polite and friendly. He explained what needed to be done and did it rapidly leaving no trace of his being there. I have had no problems with the Taps since.",HomeServe
A quick response to my water leak and coordination with my water supplier. The issue is not yet resolved but Homserve have helped me to get closer to that objective. ,HomeServe
"As I no longer have a gas boiler I was left without cover for my plumbing, drainage and electrics. I remembered that Severn Trent Water was connected to Homeserve so I googled them, saw their great introductory offer of Ã‚Â£42 for the first yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contract and signed up. A really easy process. Thank you.",HomeServe
"Great service !I had a call out a couple of weeks ago for a dripping tap, the guy offered to change my taps but I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like the taps they supply so I got my own taps and another guy returned to change them over, this was all on one call out. Both guys were happy and friendly. CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask for a better service. Thank you ! ",HomeServe
brilliant service. Plumber was out within a couple of hours of reporting the issue. He explained exactly what the issue was and repaired. Plumber was polite and cleaned everything. Well done.,HomeServe
"The Plumbing Engineer was able to diagnose the problem with our hot water tank straight away, and replace a part that could of resulted in us having a flooded ceiling & floor",HomeServe
Easy to book an appointment. Operative arrived at stated time. He repaired the taps although he said that he didn't have the exact matching parts. He also said that if we wanted to replace the taps within a year Home Serve would come and install them on the same job (ie we would not have to pay a further excess charge).,HomeServe
Switchboard was helpful and arranged for very prompt service. The plumber called round within a couple of hours and speedily and courteously solved our problem (a blocked toilet). ,HomeServe
They turned up on time. It turned out our block paved drive did not have to be dug up as the damaged drainpipe was repaired using sleeves placed through the existing pipe with a 10 year guarantee. It took several hours but it was worth avoiding replacing the driveway.,HomeServe
the blockage was cleared very quickly & affectively with the right equipment & expertise ,HomeServe
"The job was done quickly by a friendly plumberHowever, it was a non-urgent job and I was disappointed that I had to wait 7 days from making the initial call to the work being done",HomeServe

"2 and a half weeks ago we reported a large leak in our driveway, Anglian Water say we are loosing 46 litres of water an hour. We are still waiting for a date to have it repaired by Homeserve. Someone from Homeserve confirmed on 10th October that he found this leak. Today, 21st October we are still waiting to have it repaired. No-one rings us and a week ago we  escalated it as a complaint with them.   ",HomeServe
"I have only needed to use Home Serve  once, but when I phoned for help, I was swiftly given an appointment. The plumber who arrived to sort out my kitchen tap was a lovely young man, polite and got on with the job straight away. All done, in 15 minutes. I am a very satisfied customer. ",HomeServe
The actual job was done brilliantly but it was only after being put back four times (twice for wrong equipment/person turning up).The engineers know their stuff and do not fob you off with 'it seems ok'.If you have an external/blocked pipe issue (i.e beyond the immediate sink area) then make sure they do not send a plumber as all he will do is book in another visit  .... which is mildly annoying as you have to be in for half the day each time.BUT I do not want to distract from the great job they do when they actually get going,HomeServe
"Visit in response to my phone request earlier that day, the responder was very helpful and sympathetic to my situation (external leak from neighbouring house impacting on my property) and was thorough in confirming origin of leak.  He also arranged for a HomeServe plumber to visit next day to reassure me by checking my property internally for any possible leaks.   Most kind.",HomeServe

"Pipe leaking and I was told that upcoming available time slot was two days later. I explained the situation and the lady told me that somebody will call me back in 24 hours and didn't book any appointment for me.The next day morning, I called and see if I could arrange anything in the afternoon or evening. Now I was told that the next available appointment will be another two days later (which is a day behind the original available time slot). The lady suggested to book a time slot first (which I did), but now the appointment is arranged THREE days after the incident happened and reported No one called me in 24 hours since I first called them. I just sit there with the pipe leaking waiting for somebody to get in touch. I had asked in the second call if I could call a emergency plumber to fix the issue but I was told that it's not covered and I will have to pay the cost.If you can't keep your promise, then please be very clear that waiting for two days is the only option available, rather than giving people hope that somebody will call back within 24 hours and get the problem sorted. Disappointed.Update: called them again and interestingly they didn't have record of me making the 1st call. So what I have been waiting for the whole bloody day?",HomeServe
"Very early hours of a Friday morning, i realised that the enclosed cistern in the upstairs bathroom was not operating correctly and was leaking onto the floor below. I'm a 73 year old OAP who lives on her own. I could not turn the water valve to shut down the water.  I phoned just after 1.00am and explained the situation to a v understanding gentleman. He advised that a plumber would be with me within 2 hours, Plumber arrived within the hour and replaced the part to stop the leak. The floor below the cistern was now a darker colour. This is the first time I've had to use the emergency service and, based on this experience, would not hesitate to use it again. I do not want to think what damage could have been caused if the service was not available. Bothe gentlemen involved were kind, courteous and understanding. My thanks to both of them :)",HomeServe
Unfortunately the plumber was not able to solve either of my problems which is very disappointing.  I assume I will be refunded the 2 x Ã‚Â£30 I paid for these repairs which were not completed. The plumber - Callum - was very polite and apologetic.,HomeServe
"Would have more professional if the workman had tightened the tap which led to the leak. Instead he fixed the point of pipe which needed a washer, thus leaving the job partially finished. 5 minutes of his time is all that was required, alas it was Ã¢â‚¬Å“not his jobÃ¢â‚¬Â.",HomeServe
The engineer turned up and was unable to fix the leak but isolated it for a plumber to deal with,HomeServe
"There was no problem getting in touch when I phoned the operator I spoke to was helpful and to the point, The plumber that came was good got The job done no problem , sorry I can't remember the date it was . thank you .",HomeServe
We had a blocked drain. A plumber came out within 2 days of talking to Homeserve and cleared it within just over 40 mins. He explained the problem and how he was dealing with it. He also called about 30 mins before arriving to give an ETA.Every aspect of the service was very efficient.,HomeServe
Fantastic service. There were lots of spaces available. Came promptly and cleared the blockage within 15mins. So so recommend,HomeServe
My dripping tap was so rusted it took patience (and strength) to get it off and replace with new taps ,HomeServe
The engineer quickly and efficiently solved the problem of a recently installed tap which kept losing its handle. I wasn't charged a second call-out fee because it was a flaw in the tap originally installed.,HomeServe

Friendly polite plumber. Did the job in good time. Would be a 5 star but when he left I realised he had put the tap on wrong so the cold is the hot and the hot is the cold. Not big problem unless something like that will really annoy you which it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t! ,HomeServe
Quick efficient and a very professional plumber.  ,HomeServe
Very helpful polite and hopefully sorted the drainage. Difficult job for them ,HomeServe
Really good service. Our downstairs toilet was blocked and now it's been sorted by the home serve team. I'm thinking about using you again actually. I've noticed our upstairs sink is starting to get a little bit clogged up. Not quite draining properly. I may need to use the home serve team again soon.,HomeServe
I  was very pleased with my experience with Homeserve. The plumber was really pleasant and although the job turned out to be longer than originally thought he stayed and made sure that everything was working properly before he left. I would have no hesitation in recommending Homeserve. ,HomeServe

"I had two issues and Homeserve done them both on the one job so I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to book two days off work. Both plumbers were great, fixed both issues with no problems. I have used my Homeserve Insurance a few times now and it is definitely worth having. ",HomeServe
"At last homeserve sorted the problem with the blocking toilet, after calling out the bright orange company twice and paying a lot of money, homeserve fixed it! The man who came explained everything and there was no mess to clear up, very clean worker. Was very glad I subscribed to this very helpful company.

"Cancelled 1st call out 1 hours before end of call out time schedule, so waited in for hours for no reason. Especially considering they were cancelling due to staff sickness so would have known that at the beginning of the day. Didn't actually attend to leak for another 5 days after initial booking was cancelled. When they attended said leak is behind shower and they can't access pipes that aren't reachable so I'd have to get someone in to cut access.",HomeServe
Homeserve have made a very competitive Plumbing and Drainage offer which can be very simply established on line.,HomeServe
"Poor service from beginning to end. Engineer came and said he could find the source of the pipes vibration but then wrote another report to Homeserve. Left the us for 4 days with low pressure of water , return to put it back on and never solved the problem. They then sent an engineer to fix a kitchen tap which was not the problem. In the end refunded they refunded the excess charge without fixing the problem. I will be cancelling my policy with them.",HomeServe

I finally had enough and asked homecare for help. I was able to book on the website. It was simple and I was given lots of slots that I could choose from to have someone call. I booked the next day and received confirmation by email immediately. The plumber arrived exactly as planned and immediately diagnosed the problem.

Really Poor experience. I asked a plumber to fix a blockedkitchen drain. He came in quickly used a vacuum pump and in a few minutes said he was done. Asked him several times if it was fixed.

Once arranged the plumber came on time and was  very quick and efficient. When I first rang about the issue Fri 3pm. I was told Sunday would be the earliest. The person on the phone sounded shocked I only had one toilet and made me feel almost embarrassed to not have a large house. I'm sure many households still have just one toilet! I think you need to discuss this with these people to have empathy. My 5 Ã¢Ëœâ€  review is for the plumber.The person who called me before hand I would give 1Ã¢Ëœâ€  as he was rude.,HomeServe

DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come out right away because there was not structural damage BUT the leak caused more cost to me because I was charged for the leak. Homeserve  does not pay anything towards the water loss costs. It they had come straighten away there would have been less costs to me,HomeServe
Called Home Serve to report a leaking tap in my utility and an appointment was made the following day.  Chris the Plumber who attended was great.  He had to deal with a leaking utility tap which had a shower tap attached.  He managed to remove it and reinstall it with a new one purchased.

"I have been a member for nearly two years and it is first time I had to contact the repair team for a small water leak in the cylinder valve connector joint which was on a pipe outside the he cylinder. I was advised by the guy who called that even though very simple it was not covered under the contract. And office will contact me, which they never did, I had to call the following day and the first guy I spoke to was obnoxiously rude and was not able to empathise or listen to reason,  I asked to speak to someone else and the lady on the call was not able to give concise information and the cost for repair, it was so frustrating and annoying to speak to two people who do not care about the customers need or understand what was being asked even though I explained the issue in simple terms, the job could have been done by a plumber or any competent person as it just needed 3 connector joints unscrewed to be removed and refit a new part (valve) They made a simple issue look like a rocket science when it was a simple plumbing pipe fixing matter to stop the leak. I am surprised how your company trained these guys on the phone! They sounded more like thugs and after obtaining the most expensive solution for something that was a simple task for a heating maintenance Company. Never again I have stopped my DD",HomeServe

"I was impressed with the prompt appointment and ease of changing the appointment......however after having a Homeserve colleague, followed by Homeserve plumber then leak detection team......I am still in the same position as I was in the start with a subsiding drive way and no conclusion. ",HomeServe
I cannot fault this one bit The guy that come out was absolutely amazing and fix my problem. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so happy no more smelly drains.,HomeServe
In the past we have used  homeserve for plumbing  problems and they have never failed.   I am interested  to have the electrical  side now and expect  it to be as good.,HomeServe
"Easier than I expected to report a claim,book an engineer, drain fixed in a couple of days! Brilliant.",HomeServe
Arrived late afternoon to fit new cartridge that I supplied to a dripping Francke Olympus mixer tap on my kitchen sink.  Polite replaced cartridge and  left.  Unfortunately he had failed to adequately secure the cold water turn tap my fully tightening up the screw with Alan key as handle came off.  I had to resort to buying a set of Alan keys from Screwfix to ensure I could get right size Alan key to secure the tap handle.,HomeServe
"Had a leaking bath tap , took a month to fix . I wonder how long it will take if it was a major leak . Not impressed at all . ",HomeServe
"Engineer came at the time they said, couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work out the problem. Engineer was polite. No more to say. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thinks the problemÃ¢â‚¬Â is something am not covered for. Sourced a local plumber instead.",HomeServe
"I was very unhappy with the initial responses to my emergency call to Homeserve, as it took over 7 days for the plumber to visit my property to deal with the flood in my kitchen. Plus the reason I was given for the delay in the response time given by your customer services team was due to LACK OF STAFF, which is totally unacceptable. When the plumber did arrive he dealt with my problem quickly and efficiently, so this part of the overall service was acceptable.",HomeServe
I had a job booked for a Friday from 12pm till 6pm. I called at 5pm as kind of knew he wouldn't turn up now as being a Friday and most contractors finish early on a Friday. But was told I have to wait till 6pm. About 620pm I called back and was told the guy just updated the system and can't make it now. So re booked for Monday 12 pm to 6pm the guy turned up around 4pm and asked me if it had been booked for the Friday. I said yes he said don't think it was passed to anyone as he was working only 4 minutes away from where I live and could have easily done the job. My blocked drain only took him about 11 seconds to fix unblock. I was happy with the result but not the booking system. ,HomeServe
Apart from the fact that the appointment had to be delayed due to the mens' pressure of work; my toilet pipes were repaired and the blockage removed quickly. ,HomeServe
Had a leaking outside tap. Booked on the app for a visit next day. Plumber arrived on time and fitted a new tap. Job sorted. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite an expensive insurance scheme but worth it for peace of mind and service is first class. ,HomeServe
The plumber did a great job.,HomeServe
"Plumber was on time,pleasant,professional and had the problem surrendering the hour Great service",HomeServe
It was easy to arrange the visit to unblock a drain and the engineer turned up promptly and did an excellent job. ,HomeServe
"Used Homeserve web page to book plumber that was late Sunday & an appointment was available on the following day !!! plumber that came was very polite & very helpful all sorted, no fuss no botherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ excellent Adam was a credit to Homeserve.. Thankyou ",HomeServe
"I booked my appointment on line for a repair to the overflow to my toilet cistern and was given a date and time for the plumber to attend, this unfortunately was cancelled by Homeserve and in turn gave a new date for the plumber to attend two days later between the times of 6pm and 10pm which I agreed to. At about 9pm I received a call from Homeserve to tell me that the plumber would be running late and would be able to attend until around 2am (not happy) but I agreed to wait up until the plumber contacted me. The plumber did contact at about midnight and asked me what the actual problem was, hitch I explained was the same problem that i had discribed on line, nothing had changed. He then told me he was only allowed on this evening to attend emergencies which mine was not, if this had been explained to me by the office I could have had an early night. Any the plumber who very understanding and very helpful said he would the following day at 3pm, his first appointment, which he did and rectified the problem very quickly and professionally. The reason for the 5 stars is really down to the plumber and his customer focused attitude.I have always had great service from Homeserve in the past with no issues and hopefully this was just on of those blips we all have from time to time.",HomeServe
"I had a bad tap leak in the kitchen l rang homserve around 8am .spoke to one of yours advisor stated the urgency of the leak. She tells me you would be put as priority. Waiting waiting, waiting. Call again  spoke to another advisor yes they got me down but then said waiting for me to call back or something.As no one was going to be coming till l pay a fee.Which l can not understand why l then have to pay a call out fee on top of monthly payments. By the time the engineer cam out it was well over lunchtime.  The was running all that time. However the engineer that came was very good and l think he was surprised of time since call but he didn't say anything on that that sorry.I can't say that l wouldn't recommend this service...But when you have no choice as l want things covered but stll feel that you shouldn't have to make a payment first.Because of the least of time that the water was running it has cause damage I think this was 16.10.24. Or 17.10.24 As l had to go to my insurance through what happened  M.Hunt ",HomeServe
"Once more my thanks to all at Homeserve who helped sort bathroom leak....just as I was about to be admitted to hospital.Thankfully the leak was isolated ... I had to buy a new tap and engineer Robinson came to fix it.  There was a problem, but he persevered and did his best to solve it, which he did.I think all those I've dealt with at Homeserve share one fine attribute:  they care.  And do their best.  Barrie Tracey, Stratford upon Avon.",HomeServe
Would only clear 1 drain not the second !? Would need another call out for that !?,HomeServe

The plumber arrived within the scheduled time slot, and efficiently and knowledgeably dealt with my kitchen related issue, which involved a new tap system. The plumber was a very affable guy who inspired confidence in the quality of his work.",HomeServe
"The gentleman that came to fix our drains called Wayne Resoli did a fantastic job.  He was clean, neat tidy and very polite. I feel he went above and beyond he is a credit to your company couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be happier.",HomeServe
"Easy to book appointment for plumbing engineer to come out, quick response time and very knowledgeable chap, identified the problem quickly and set about solving it. Even noticed and mentioned a bodge job on tap fixings from a fitting from before. Would give the Engineer 5 stars.",HomeServe
It was a simple job but very difficult access.The plumber had it sorted very quickly.,HomeServe
Plumber arrived the same day as I reported the problem. Arrived on time. Did an excellent job. Well pleased all round.,HomeServe

"Homeserve have so far cancelled two appointments to repair a broken toilet cistern. We waited in for two whole afternoons. When I phoned up on behalf of my wife they were unable to guarantee any day when an engineer would definitely turn up, so potentially this could go on and on and on. The appointment has been re-booked, yet again, for one week's time. The monthly payment is about Ã‚Â£30 and there is also an excess of Ã‚Â£30 for each call-out. Naturally, we are now wondering what we have been paying for all these years. There is little point in putting pressure on the call centre staff since, as in many online companies nowadays, they can't really do anything more than they are mandated to do and can't necessarily contact other people who could sort things out. My only reluctant advice would be to declare everything initially as an 'emergency' which we didn't want to do since it might take away from someone else but which might possibly make a difference in service. On the other hand, homeserve should have the capacity to provide the service they offer and for which they charge customers. Would any other company be better? I don't know, but probably worth looking into.Since writing this, Homeserve appeared for the third and fourth appointments. Everything went fine. Apparently, there were problems both with the company systems and local contract staff being ill. Who knows? But the job was done well ultimately and they gave us a bit of a refund. So all was well in the end. ",HomeServe
"Although the plumber couldn't fix my problem himself, he offered sage advice and fixed another problem that I didn't even know I had at the time. He was polite and personable and gave an excellent service.",HomeServe
"We had quite a poor experience. First they could not come for 7 days so we were mopping up the leak for a while and the heating kept needing topping up. Then on the day of the visit they didn't show up (having taken time off work to be there) and said they'd come the next day for an all day visit! So someone had to be in from 8-6 with no idea of arrival time. The engineer turned up at 4pm (so that's a total of 8h that day plus 5h from the day before). He stopped the leak but said we weren't covered for leaking radiator valves, Which on our policy it clearly stated we were (just had the renewal through and it looks like they've ditched that for new policies but was included in our old one, it gave it as a specific example). On the positive side they did refund the ""excess charge"" when I complained. Also the ""fix"" he did has stopped the leak so at least we didn't have to call another plumber. Hence 2 stars not 1. Overall a stressful and disappointing experience.",HomeServe
"Had a flood in my kitchen yesterday morning after water leaked through a pipe in the bathroom.  Rang Homeserve and requested an urgent visit due to me having a child with disabilities.  Had to call back at 4pm today as no plumber.  The booking system went down yesterday so thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why the call out wasn't booked in.  Finally had a plumber arrive at 6pm.  He was great and fixed the problem.  But having a young and vulnerable child in the house with no water for 36 hours is not ok.  The call centre operative today was great unlike yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s person.  He sorted everything out in a matter of minutes.  But if the system was down yesterday how did people have a plumber today?  Mistakes happen, I get that, but I had an emergency and it was not dealt with as it should have been",HomeServe
"My toilet is leaking and the engineer didn't repair it. He also didn't want to listen to my concerns. I was told that I would be refunded for the excess amount of Ã‚Â£30, but I have not received it yet. I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the recent service I received regarding my toilet issue. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the problem, my toilet has neither been repaired nor replaced.Additionally, I have been charged an excess fee for this unresolved service. This is unacceptable and has caused significant inconvenience and frustration.I expect a higher level of service from a company like Homeserve. I hope you will take my feedback seriously and implement changes to prevent similar experiences for other customers.I would appreciate it if you could address this issue promptly and take steps to rectify the situation, including refunding the excess fee and scheduling a repair or replacement of my toilet.",HomeServe
The plumber was very helpful & knowledgeable.,HomeServe
Used home serve 4 times now. This last time for underground leaking water pipe. Absolutely brilliant job by engineer Jordon. Real tradesman and a credit to the company.would recommended HomeServe great service . Highly pleased.,HomeServe
Engineer identified problem where leak came from quickly and repaired it  rapidly. He advised me how to dry wet floor and carpet ,HomeServe
"I have been with Homeserve for many years and have always received first class service. Of course, I'd rather not have to call you out but when I do the plumber has always been polite, friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. ",HomeServe
"This service is extremely valuable since most home insurers do not cover the costs of locating leaks, which can often be a challenging and time-consuming endeavor. Homeserve UK offers this essential service at what I believe is a very reasonable price. After all, it's always better to be safe than sorry.",HomeServe
We had a water leak on our driveway from the bluepipe and it was sorted out well. Homeserve highly recommended. ,HomeServe
"Came and fixed the leak the day after i reported it,which was very efficient. The leak was found repaired on the same day. The the hole was then back filled and tarmac topped to finish off, however didn't have enough tarmac to finish it off and said he would return to finish it off the next day, and has not yet been back to finish it off. Othewise a very good service.",HomeServe

"The plumber turned up within an hour of my phone call and set to work immediately. he left no stone, or floorboard, unturned tracking the source of my water leak. He worked smoothly and eventually found the source of the problem. Before he left he replaced floorboards etc to how they were. A very pleasant chap.",HomeServe
The Homeserve plumber that changed the radiator was really professional & courteous. He did a great job & am pleased we were able to get the job done through the cover we have. ,HomeServe
A dripping valve on the cold water tank was replaced quickly and efficiently. The plumber and trainee were courteous and helpful. Unfortunately this was the second appointment as no-one turned up for the 3rd October. I was informed 5 hours after the time window. I lodged a complaint which was ignored,HomeServe
"When the plumbers came they were friendly, professional and did an excellent job. We did, however, have issues with booking the first appointment. We have had two separate appointments recently, the second of which went like clockwork and was entirely satisfactory. The first appointment, however, was made for 11 Oct. We waited in and no one came, then eventually I received a text to say they could not make the appointment and had re-booked for the 13th. This was not convenient, so I changed it to the 12th. Again, we waited in, and no one turned up, nor did I receive any updates from Homeserve. At the end of the day, I re-booked the appointment yet again for the 16th, and this time, the plumber attended and everything went smoothly and efficiently. ",HomeServe
Repair completed with minimum effect on decor which will be easily rectified with better access to pipework in the future should the issue reoccur.,HomeServe
All the plumber could offer were excuses not to do any repairs. I have cancelled our sunscription. Shoddy lametable customer care. Shedueling of the visit was shambolic.,HomeServe
This was the first time I have used the service although I have had the policy for many years. It was quick and easy to phone the help line. I had two plumbing issues. I was surprised to find that a plumber would arrive the same day I phoned which was a Saturday. The plumber arrived at the time arranged after phoning about 30 minutes before. He identified the issue and fixed it within an hour. All the necessary parts were on the phone. ,HomeServe
The plumber was quick efficient and professional. My only negative is itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nice to speak to a human when phoning for the service rather than a machine although placing the call was still easy.,HomeServe
We had a leak on our drive.Homeserve arranged an inspection and repair. It was great! Repair done quickly with no disruption and drive left in fantastic condition. Really happy with service ,HomeServe
"Homeserve were always very quick in arranging contractors' visits to identify both the source of the leak leak and to effect its repair. The only minor hiccup was the first contractor's visit which was to check for a leak internally when SWW had already conformed that the leak was external. Otherwise, Homeserve and their agents wherever good.",HomeServe
Your plumber was an efficient guy pleasant too ,HomeServe
You came out straight away and have been back several times to find my leak.Now believe found where it is now waiting for the digging team to come out and replace the pipe.Will say your team is excellent and very knowledgeable.,HomeServe

Water leak fixed courteously and efficiently the day it was reported. ,HomeServe
"We had a problem with a water leak and three engineers over three days came to try and assess the problem. Thankfully it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a problem that involved ruining our tiles, decor etc and related to a job we had had done outside in our garden. We have been able to resolve it with those contractors. We were very impressed by homeserve.",HomeServe
"Easy to book the appointment online. The plumber arrived on time and quickly sorted out the leak. After fixing it, he tested it and also changed the flush mechanism as he felt that was also close to failure. Can't fault the service we received.",HomeServe
Very helpful and efficient engineer fitted new stoptap previously   not completed properly  also fitted new cistern,HomeServe
Bad experience. The engineer turned up. Was grumpy. Saw the leak in the driveway which was coming up from underground. It was on our land but was supplying our next door neighbour. He just said that it was pouring out at a really fast rate and causing damage to our drive. Nothing he could do about it and just left leaving the leak and continual damage. Just left with a shrug. I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be renewing our policy. ,HomeServe
"Initially annoyed that my appointment postponed. However I cannot fault the time spent by the engineer in tracing the ""mains leak"", which is on the boundary of our property, and the time he spent trying to explain to Southern Water the tests he had carried out. Some weeks ago Southern Water mended a push fit coupling where their pipe meets the plastic pipe to our property. This repair has probably not worked due to the excessively high water pressure (10 bars) in the locality which makes repairs difficult and the added problem of having to digging down very deep to locate the join. Southern Water came round to recheck the leak whilst we were on holiday, and said it was on our property. We did not/do not believe them, and we feel that the visit of Homeserve confirmed this. We have tried and are trying to obtain a report from Southern Water of the extent of their investigations on their second visit!",HomeServe
Called out to clear a blocked rain water drain . Arrived on time specified and tried to solve problem. Advised that it was a soak away which which appeared to be blocked by earth and plant roots so was unable to assist.Disappointed he could not give me any advice as to best way to have it cleared.,HomeServe

I know it took several visits to deal with our problem but that was t all homeserve 's doing. Anglian water needed to come and replace the outside stopcock before homeserve could complete the inside stopcock work. Sadly I e forgotten the name of the final person but think his name was Andy? I do know that Kevin was very thorough and informative and reassuring.  The work was finished to a high standard and I may have got the final date wrong but the problem was ongoing for a couple of months. Overall very satisfied and pleased with the whole job was handled. Thank you. Roger,HomeServe

"Excellent  from start to finish. We made an initial call to yourselves, after speaking to Yorkshire Water re our problem, friendly lady guided us and booked a technician to do a house call.The young gent arrived late afternoon on the day we booked . Very nice young man named Tarq .... ...He checked  our property for any untowards leaks, nothing  was found. He explained  thoroughly  he offered whilst  he was doing a report, to listen to the Yorkshire Water board what they had to say. Well a mystery. Very high very high bill, that  we did what they asked  of us. So hopefully it will get sorted  we just needed the meeting reading if Tarq.... made a note of it.Very pleased with his  service.

I am happy with the service as they came within a week and fixed the drainage issue at my house. It's worth taking this service which is cheaper and satisfactory. ,HomeServe
I still have to wait for the flush button to come up and one time in about six it does not come up and I have to lift cistern lid and bang it down.This is the reason I left Homeserve before . ,HomeServe
Automatic voice booking service booked us in for the wrong job which was annoying but the chap who came to do it sorted us out for a further appointment's with correct plumber. The second appointment the plumber who arrived was polite efficient and quickly identified the problem and did the necessary repairs ,HomeServe
"Really awful automated phone line which made it difficult to speak to anyone (on purpose?) and resulted in someone coming out to fix a blocked drain when we had a water leak. Apart from that our experience of Homeserve was mostly a good one. All the contractors that came out were knowledgeable and helpful, but we were left without water for a few days waiting for someone to come and install a temporary supply.",HomeServe
"A very bad experience. My cold water tank was leaking. I contacted HomeServe and was told an engineer would   be sent to sort out my problem. It took 4 attempts due to sickness, too late but would get it dealt with, 2 incompetent engineers who partially emptied the leaking tank. I was left with no water in bathroom and no hot water in kitchen and because I insisted on keeping the heating I would have been without that as well. Luckily I found an excellent carpenter who built a new platform for the new tank. My next appointment was for 6 days time, having to deal without the usual facilities. Having to fill up buckets of water to flush the toilet, boil up water to wash, etc. in kitchen sink.I managed to move it forward a couple of days. The carpenter was here ready to work round the engineer. Whilst he was here I received a phone call cancelling the plumber. The carpenter luckily took over and insisted it was dealt with that day 15th October. It was dealt with that afternoon thanks to the carpenter. I was left feeling very upset and angry to be let down.",HomeServe
The plumber arrived very promptly. He was polite and helpful.The job was carried out with minimum fuss and mess. He cleaned up after the job was finished.Very happy with the service.,HomeServe
The drain from our sink outflow to the sewer was blocked - a fat ball which I don't understand how it got there - and resulted in water all over our back yard. But the problem was quickly fixed by rodding the drain and we are now back in business - to our immense relief.,HomeServe
Very easy to take out plumbing insurance with homeserve online. Clear description of the product and easy to set up an account online.,HomeServe
The problem was quickly located and a new washer fitted. This resolved the problem.,HomeServe
"I waited in on the afternoon on the first date (15th Oct) and then was told late on that they couldn't get to me. Then the call was cut off before I could agree a future date, which meant that I had to go through all the security again and phone up to rearrange a second date.I had to wait in again on the second date, two days later, but it was more successful and the plumber eventually arrived and told me the hot water side of my mixer tap was seized and the whole thing would have to be replaced not fixed. I had to remove all the boxing in panelling myself and I now have a really small cheap looking mixer tap, as a replacement for my original quite impressive one. But it does work reasonably well and the plumber was a pleasant guy.",HomeServe
"My experience with homeserve is brilliant we were getting a new kitchen fitted which is a stressful time anyway .That's when we realised the stop tap was siezed and dripping .That's when I remembered I had homserve cover ,when i phoned up they came out the next day at a time which suited us  and resolved the issue .No delaying our kitchen install at all which i was dreading . I would highly recommend homserve to everyone I know and would recommend to anyone  . Highly professional service. ",HomeServe

"Our first time using Home Serve proved to be a excellent experience, from our initial call which explained the process,( we had a leak which we could not detect which area it was in ), we were kept informed re the time/day when the engineer would be calling and we received a call 30 minutes before his arrival , the engineer detected it was under the kitchen floor but explained he was unable to locate the exact spot so would arrange for us another appointment ( a couple of days later ) with another department of Home Serve who would be able with the correct tools to detect the exact spot this enabling the least amount of tiles etc to disturb , both engineers were very efficient in their work , we would definitely highly recommend Home Serve ",HomeServe
"From first contact through to resolution of my water leakage issue, everyone I dealt with was professional, punctual, courteous and efficient. Cannot fault them in any part of the process and would happily recommend to anyone.",HomeServe
"Promise to come, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come without telling us phone or email, bad communication. 2 days letter he came and he said is not cover . We explained to them about it the problem shower liking. Never again joining again with homeserve ",HomeServe
My problem was resolved efficiently but not without some difficulty for the plumber. He was super calm and dealt with everything graciously!,HomeServe
"Contact was good and appointment for Engineer to call quickly made. On attending, he quickly fitted a new water tap to the kitchen basin and left the area in clean and dry condition.",HomeServe
"The eng: arrived in quickly and repaired the damaged pipe, ",HomeServe
"Competent, efficient engineer quickly restored the function of my toilet",HomeServe

"Excellent Adam was polite curtious and friendly made me at ease , it was a Sunday he did a temporary fix and organised a new toilet to be fitted on Tuesday , he even changed his working hrs so he could fit it before I had to go to work . Valued member of staff does your company proud hold onto him goes over and beyond Thankyou Adam ",HomeServe
"Really friendly, helpful drainage engineer. Problem sorted in no time.",HomeServe
Your Engineer did a thorough review of the situation on arrival and resolved the leak by replacing the radiator valve with one he had in his van.,HomeServe
"He man that came to clear my drains , did a wonderful .clean ,and good job",HomeServe
"The engineer was appalling, he cut off me water supply in my downstairs W.C advising that my floor was collapsing; my builder advised this was nonsense. He also cut off my upstairs sink as there was a leak, he said again that my floor was collapsing; again my builder refuted these claims as my floor is fine.At the end of the day he left me with a capped sink upstairs and capped W.C downstairs as he was too lazy to fix either. I feel the need to point out this incompetence as a gas engineer is not in any way qualified to inspect the structure of a home as per qualified builders. Disgusted",HomeServe
Homeserve Never lets you down....the engineer was young girl plumber which I had never seen before and she solved the problem was so helpful. ,HomeServe
"Minor plumbing issue, but very helpful and friendly. Identified the issue and fixed straight away. ",HomeServe

"The engineer that came to visit us was incredible. He helped us unblock an outside drain, nothing was too much for him and he went above and beyond to get it sorted. Very grateful, thank you again. ",HomeServe
"We had a few plumbing jobs that needed doing. Was able to book an engineer without delay who managed to do these jobs effectively.However the booking experience was far from ideal as it was automated which is fine if you don't have any query like I had and needed to speak with a living person.Anyhow notwithstanding the above, a great service, friendly punctual engineers.Highly recommended as private plumbers cost a fortune and some are dishonest. Plumbing insurance from home serve is the way forward ",HomeServe
"The plumber was very helpful, worked quickly, solved the problem and explained everything. I was pleased that the service was so prompt. 15.1",HomeServe

Booked on line - plumber arrived and sorted problem in 10mins,HomeServe
"Waterboard came when they said, same day.Excellent service for a dirty job.So relieved I was.",HomeServe
The plumber arranged to do the work said that he could not mend our dripping tap without removing the bath or making a hole through the adjacent bedroom wall. I sent for an independent plumber who just replaced a valve to resolve the problem.I did receive my Ã‚Â£30 back on request.,HomeServe
Had an outside sink drain pipe blocked AND leaking. Next day repair by a blocked drain person who carried plumbing parts Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin caseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - job done.,HomeServe

"We used to have home serve years ago but I cancelled my policy as I thought I was covered in my home insurance, I want the peace of mind of knowing I am covered for drainage pipes etc, it was easy to set up",HomeServe
Recently I had a seized tap.  Contacting Homeserve was a very easy process and the whole process of identifying the fault and fitting a replacement tap was undertaken in a very professional manner.  Thank you!,HomeServe
"Terrible service. Never sent all policy docs when took out policies for Plumbing & Drains,  electrics and boiler cover.Then they did gas certificate and didnt send gas certificate. Then when gas certificate finally arrived has incomplete address and told it cant be amended and engineer needs to come back out ! Takes ages to get through to book an appointment. You complain and that takes ages to resolve.Going to transfer all my landlord policies to better provider.Regret using them.Youve asked me to e mail just deal with the complaint I've logged ",HomeServe
"Phoned up in the morning plumber turned up in the afternoon the same day, very nice guy and he solved the problem with the water leak right away, very clean and no mess.",HomeServe

"Hassle free claim. The plumber who worked on the issue was experienced professional, managed to fix the problem promptly.",HomeServe
The automated booking system was good. Engineer Chris did a good job. He had to remove some tiles to get to the pipework and he was very careful. He was cheerful and tidied up well taking all the rubish away with him. ,HomeServe
I was in a total panic as I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just have a leak Ã¢â‚¬Â¦the water was flooding out! I could not turn off the stopcock as I have arthritis in my hands so had to run out onto the street to shout for help. When the plumber came he was reassuring and managed to get most of the water sucked up. He also dragged out the sodden blankets and towels into my garden. I will always be grateful for his help and expertise ( also the stranger who waded through and turned off my stopcock!),HomeServe
Appointment was easy to make and my dripping tap was sorted quickly by a pleasant engineer even though it was a Sunday Afternoon ,HomeServe
"The very pleasant, friendly young man who came to fix my loo.  It didn't take him long, and a good job done.",HomeServe
We booked an appointment today from 8 am to 6 pm. It is now 4:30 pm and we have not heard from the plumber whether he is coming or not. We have waited in all day and I telephoned the company at around 2 pm to find out if they could give us any indication as to when he would be coming. They told me that they do not have a copy of the PlumberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  job schedule and that all that he would do would be to call us when he was en route. I told him that this is not a satisfactory way of running a business. They need to implement a system to keep customers informed as to approximately what time the plumber would be arriving. Ã¯Â¿Â¼,HomeServe
Two good engineers. The reason when I started the contract it said all water supplies covered. When I got the contract after paying it was pointed out to me by the first engineer that drinking water taps attached to softeners were not covered. However I purchased the required tap and it was installed by the second engineer. Bit of a challenge which was covered by the enginneers being good guys.,HomeServe
The repair was completed very quickly on the day we reported a dripping tap. However the next day the tap became loose and we had to call out for this to be fixed. Again the work was done very quickly and we were very happy with the service. My low score is therefore based on the unsatisfactory 1st repair.,HomeServe
Dripping tap sorted out promptly and efficiently. Very happy with service.,HomeServe
"First I got my tap fixed in good time. It was easy to book an appointment for a technician to come, and even when I had to reschedule I did that seamless over the phone. I was satisfied with the service ",HomeServe
"Returning from Holiday, our cold water tap was stuck. I realised that I was probably covered by my Homeserve contract. The Plumber arrived at the prearranged time the following day & deemed that a new set of taps were required. He fitted the new taps & to my surprise told me that the cost of the taps was covered by my Homeserve policy - good news. My only criticism during the whole procedure was with the initial contact over the phone where I ended up talking to a machine (with a female voice) - it took a good while to explain my problem. ",HomeServe
"Very good service easy to renew my pipe & drain cover, am very bisy looking after my elderly mother, so it is a great weight of my mind knowing everything is covered & help is at hand should something go wrong.",HomeServe
Very efficient young plumber. Did a great job and left everything clean. Thank you.,HomeServe
"Finding damp under the sink called for help. Delighted to get an appointment the same day.  My plumber was prompt, finished in time for me to go out. He was helpful in offering advice to mitigate any further leaks ",HomeServe

Having a leak from my hot water pipe I able to quickly arrange for a plumber to visit mr property the very next day. The plumber who visited my property was very very helpfull in locating the fault and replacing the faulty part with a better hot water pipe.,HomeServe
"I had managed to accumulate 8 various plumbing repairs that needed fixing under my policy. All repairs arranged for the same day with 2 return visits when parts in stock.  Plumber very friendly and efficient. He remembered me from a previous visit a couple of years ago when he had to replace a faulty kitchen tap for me. One the repair was for a gold bath mixer tap with shower attachment all of which would not work. However company only offered a silver replacement which would have meant him dismantling my bath changing a 30 minute job into one lasting several hours.  He managed to convince his superiors to pay for a gold replacement tap as it would be the cheapest option. I could not praise his workmanship and his attitude to me enough. I am disabled and I just explained where the various repairs were in the house and left him to it. He worked quickly, efficiently and without creating a lot of mess and disruption. If you have any sort of employee of the month scheme etc, I think you should be considering him for it and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d happily vouch/recommend him for it. The way he treat me and the efficiency of his workmanship would make me happily recommend HOMESERVE to family and friends. Unfortunately he said I was his last customer as he was leaving the company for pastures new. Which is a shame as I think you have lost a valuable employee and team member. He even recommended a work colleague to ask for should I require other plumbing claims on my HOMESERVE policy. ",HomeServe
"The engineer was very punctual and was very pleasant and explained everything. He was very skilled and tidy. He changed the valve on the kitchen mixer tap, and told me if it couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be changed he would change the tap. The tap was not of the standard I had but that was only if the valve could not be changed. He also said if there was an issues just ring back and he would come back. His name was Mal and he was excellent.",HomeServe
"Block drain reported Thursday night rang homeserve who booked an engineer for the next morning, engineer advised when on route completed job in a timely manner. Excellent service from point of contact Thursday evening to completion of work 11am next day. Worth every penny",HomeServe
"Broken flushing mechanism necessitated replacement of both toilet annd cistern  Apart from the fact that the initial appointment was cancelled due to the lack of Suitable Plumber our dysfunctional toilet was replaced by Jake on his first visit. He was polite, friendly and especially sympathetic to the needs of an elderly couple. The job involved a considerable amount of initiative on his part to source a suitable replacement toilet and the work was carried out in an efficient manner with a minimum of fuss and inconvenience. Jake liaised effectivly with his Line Manager, who was also Ã¢â‚¬Ëœon the ballÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.The only minor inconvenience was that it took well over a week to collect the damaged toilet and cistern until Jake sorted that problem out as well.",HomeServe
Great Service rang and got appointment for leak from bathroom on the same day. Plumber  came around and a really nice person who sorted the issue out straight away. I cannot fault the Service I had yesterday. ,HomeServe

"AMAZING SERVICE!We had the pleasure of having Cordi Behdad, a plumbing engineer from HomeServe, attend to a leak in our bathroom today. From the moment he arrived, Cordi's friendly and professional demeanor was evident, making the experience very comfortable. Despite previous attempts by other engineers to resolve the issue, Cordi thoroughly assessed and quickly identified the source of the leak.He took additional care to protect our carpets during his work and left the area spotless as if he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been there at all. CordiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dedication and attention to detail were truly exceptional. We are extremely grateful for his service and want to extend our thanks to HomeServe for their outstanding team.",HomeServe

They called at 10:30 to say they will be 25 minutes, they arrived on time, was very polite, replaced parts on three pipes and was done by 11:30am.

"first visit, arrived late, well after agreed timeslot (was called to let know but only as end of time window approaching); fixed leak at rear of toilet very quickly but almost immediately another leak appeared, initially I was unclear where from, but it turned out to be another pipe at the rear of the same toilet.  Charged second excess fee to book another visit as Homeserve said unrelated to first.  Engineer running late and missed timeslot again, offered to still come but said it would be well after 10pm and that he's unable to do much at that time.  Agreed to arrange another time next day instead, then got call saying no appointments next day and had to book for a few days later.  Engineer turned up and had to break tiles for access to fix the leak; very apolgetic but stated Homeserve will fix leak but not make good any damage they cause; was only on site for a few minutes.  2x call out excesses paid, for 2x leaks with same toilet, and left with a big hole in the tiling - not impressed.",HomeServe

"For the first time in 15 years, after being repeatedly tempted by 50p-a-month introductory offers, I finally gave in and signed up. Near the end of my first year, I encountered an issue with the kitchen tap. I called customer service on a Saturday morning at 9:00 am, and by 11:30 am, an engineer was at my home. He capped off the tap, removed the fitting, and asked when the new tap would arrive. I mentioned it would be that afternoon. As he left, he assured me it was scheduled for installation on Monday between 8:00 am and 1:00 pm.On Monday at 9:00 am, I called to confirm the appointment, only to find they had no record of it. I explained my situation, and they rescheduled for that evening between 5:00 pm and 10:00 pm. Then, at 9:00 pm, I received a call informing me they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to come after all. With a trip to Leeds planned the next day, everything had fallen apart.In the end, I called my handyman, who came and installed it on Tuesday morning. The whole experience was a complete shamblesÃ¢â‚¬â€no running water in the kitchen for days. With only a couple of weeks left on my contract, I canceled my renewal. Very disappointed and incredibly stressed!A week has passed. I sent the invoice as requested. As of Sunday, I am still waiting to hear from them.",HomeServe
"Once a claim is accepted (all done online), HomeServe attend when they say they will and see the job through to completion, no matter how problematic it may be. In my case for example, removing a toilet cistern whose fixing nuts were rusted solid.",HomeServe
"Whilst they never disputed our claim was valid, getting the leak fixed was made a major issue by them,meaning a very long wait,water and mud everywhere,and a lot of stress and many phone calls.",HomeServe
"There were loads of appointments to choose from to suit me. The plumber called before arriving, when the plumber did arrive shortly after the call they were polite, professional, knowledgeable and got the work done super quickly. I could not be happier with this service. ",HomeServe

"Home serve rep has wrongly diagnosed the water leak from temperature controller, refused to detect the water leak and asked me to call another plumber.

There was no leak from temperature controller as it was not leaking.   .  ",HomeServe
"HomeServe, customer service plumber blamed a lack of silicon as the root cause of recent claim. Nothing to do with a botched job in my wet room drain, no tanked basin, crap joints under invisible drain. Wood was rotten on every wall frame, from ground level up to chest level. And he blames a lack of silicon. I have lifted all the flooring, tiles and slate flooring in kitchen bathroom and living area, all at my cost and time. You have earned your commission Mr Plumber and avoided a genuine claim. I have cancelled HomeServe, Not, and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be back. CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see any point in having pipe or drain insurance. Broken Britain at every level. Two joiners and a fully qualified plumber I hired indicated a faulty drain was the cause, fitted two years before I bought the house. Honesty and honor are values no more recognized at the expense of the customer. I signed his home report to get rid of him out of my house. Fuming ! ",HomeServe
I waited 6 hours for the plumber in a cold house only to be called just before 6.00pm to say there was a delay and the visit wouldn't take place. Really not happy ,HomeServe

"Engineer turned up, took one look at the tap which was faulty and stiff as required a new cartridge, sneered and said ''it ain't broken, it kinda works, you're not covered'' and off he went. No common sense applied to fix issue before it got worse to save another call out.Thank you for your prompt reply.  In addition to my comments above it was the engineer's attitude that compounded my dissatisfaction, not particularly helpful and wanted to leave as quick as possible. I have however managed to reclaim my excess as know work was done.",HomeServe
External water leak identified by South West Water requiring replacement piping.  Operator forced to cut through mass of tree roots to reach pipe.  Hard work that took him hours but he finally managed it - and all done with a smile.,HomeServe
I called to say a long standing drainage problem was causing issues and had back up. They sent a plumber not a drainage engineer who did the basic unblock. Even he wrote down the drainage engineer needed to come. No one bothered to contact me. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re fast enough to take your Ã‚Â£30 excess and put your yearly bill up though! Not good ,HomeServe

Found the problem and rectified it within minutes, he had to lift the drain in the front garden, you'd have never had know he's been there, he put everything back how it was.  Absolutely fantastic service all sorted within under 12 hours from 1st call to engineer leaving. 5 star.  ",HomeServe
Easy to book on line for engineerEngineer arrived on time and fixed leak,HomeServe
The response was so quick when I called with a burst pipe. Although the man who came out from emergency team did nothing but tell me someone else would come and he shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been called out for this after 3 days the engineer who came out was so helpful. He apologised for me being left for that time and spent the time to find where the leak came from. He removed all pipes that were empty and not used and fixed the leak soon as he found it. He was clean working and tidying up as he went along. I was grateful for the help he gave me that day. He went above and beyond to find all the parts of the pipe that were faulty. ,HomeServe
The plumber made the visit on time looked at repairing the tap on my sink unit on inspection he commented on how old the plumbing was and said he couldn't make the repair due to the access was too limited for him on this he said he would send another fitter. I ended up employing another plumber to fix my problem which I had to pay for consequently SChidwick,HomeServe
The engineer who came out was so quick and helpful. Very friendly. Helped me find a new toilet seat too which was above and beyond. I had been struggling to find it because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a weird shape and size. ,HomeServe
Easy phone process to log fault and receive an emergency appointment. The plumber attended exactly as promised and carried out the repair quickly and efficiently.,HomeServe
ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s was very easy from start where I reported my leaking outside water stop tap through to the work being carried out by a very professional individual who completed everything to a very good standard ,HomeServe
"Ive had an insurance policy for years covering two properties. Ive not really liked the attitude of engineer's in the past,  its often felt like they dont want to be here and its a chore to do the job they're being paid for. However the last engineer Haithem came to do some plumbing repairs and he has changed my whole view on the company, polite worked fast and made me feel at ease. Haithem has restored my faith in homeserve, ill be renewing my policy instead of cancelling as i see a huge improvement of who they employ now. Thank you Haithem from your frieinds in kensal rise!",HomeServe

The engineer arrived on time and rectified the problem with the toilet flush button quickly and efficiently. Thank you HomeServe,HomeServe
Very quick response. . Plumber came within 4 hours and stopped a leak. He was also a very nice and helpful guy ,HomeServe
Homeserve recently replaced the flushing mechanism on our downstairs toilet.Three weeks later the mechanism broke and we have had to call them out again (incurring a further Ã‚Â£30 charge which I hope will be refunded).The same thing happened last year when we called them out to repair our upstairs toilet.,HomeServe
The plumber who came was excellent ,HomeServe
We almost had to dig up the kitchen floor to get to a pipe but the guys from home serve came up with a much better plan and because of their thoughtful approach saved us from a massive headache. ,HomeServe
"I was treated with respect when I phoned up initially. The engineers let me know in advance when they would arrive and were prompt. They protected my hall carpet with sheeting and overshoes. The work was carried out efficiently and with minimum disruption. However, I was not informed on what was being done, apart from that my water tank was to be partially emptied. It wasn't until they were leaving that I was informed I had been fitted with a new immersion heater, and that was only when I asked what had been done. I thought the main engineer was a bit abrupt and condescending. ",HomeServe
"We were 6,000 miles away.My 18 year old boy was at home.He accidentally left the emersion heater on when he went to work. The hot water backed up through the system and filled the loft cold water tank with scolding hot water. The tank eventually developed a split in the plastic tank. As the metal plumbing reacted against the plastic.I had to talk him through tying up the (now collapsed) ballcock to stop the incoming water flow.This he did (I don't know how well!) Bail out as much of the water in the tank.He then contacted Homeserve.All they did, on their visit, a day later... Was say everything was OK.*I would have appreciated having an isolation valve fitted in the pipework.I have used you for years on end.I find 'Your' response GLIB. Considering the hourly wage of your fitters. Running a fleet, including fuel outlay... Would an extra Ã‚Â£5 cripple the company?  ",HomeServe
Although I had a leaking pipe the earliest that an engineer could attend was in 3 days. This is too slow when there is an active leak!When he did attend the engineer was very good and repaired the leak very professionally.,HomeServe
"Engineer rang on way to our home, informed e of his name (Connor) and arrived. Very pleasant and got straight on to the problem. Tap changed as existing one unrepairable. Connor was fantastic and did a great job leaving no mess, full 5 stars for great service, please pass on our thanks.",HomeServe
Plumber got hot and cold mixer taps wrong way round ie hot is cold  cold is hot. did arrive at time stated,HomeServe
Carl was punctual and communicative prior to the visit. He was very understanding and explained everything in simple terms so that I understood the problem. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very good and knowledgable plumber. ,HomeServe
"The plumber just looked took a photograph and said its your shower,which he left running,and went.He also said there could be a leak from one of the central heating pipes and we should get it checked.we thought this was his job?He was here about 10 minutes and went.He sat in his van longer than he was in the houseThat cost me Ã‚Â£30.I then contacted my usual plumber who came straight out and re sealed the shower and checked all my pipe work,including taking up the floorboards.",HomeServe
Good quick job done by a friendly  efficient plumber. ,HomeServe
I was told that the leak I had from my shower bar was not covered in the policy. I am elderly and the plumber left without advice of how to sort out the problem. So lam still without a shower. ,HomeServe
Had a problem with an underground water leak contacted home serve paid the Ã‚Â£30 excess they arranged an engineer to call two days later two polite lads arrived located the leak and replaced the pipe with new plastic one filled in the hole and replaced the patio slabs only took about 3 hrs everything was left clean and tidy.cant fault them.,HomeServe

Very good customer service and fix of a complicated drain blockage,HomeServe
The plumber arrived when expected and did a full leak check and confirmed there was no leak between the metre and the house. We were then able to advise the water company of this and they are giving us an allowance.,HomeServe
Polite and efficient. The plumber came the same day to fix my tap and it was Sunday. DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the right tsp so made another appointment and kept to it.,HomeServe
I had a leak on my basin waste. Contacted Homeserve and an engineer came 2 days later. Good service Thank you.,HomeServe
The plumber was quick snd my tap works well,HomeServe
I put a call in to fix a dripping tap. The tap is a mixer tap with water filter on the cold tap. When the plumber arrived he stated this type of tap was not covered and walked out. I asked about the Ã‚Â£30 fee. He stated he still got this and even boasted that he got the fee when no one was in. I pursauded him to change the cartridge on the hot tap just in case the drip was there. He found he did not have quite the right cartridge so he forced a larger one in. It stopped the drip but the tap is now out of alignment.I will have to get another plumber to do the job properly. I cancelled by subscription.,HomeServe
"Arranging the visit was straightforward,  we didn't have to wait too long for the plumbers visit. He was friendly and capable. He also gave me advice about another issue which might need attention in the future.",HomeServe
"Engineer who visited to fix our kitchen tap was very nice and spent time to make sure job was done properly and to high standard, as oppose to engineer who visited earlier to fix our flush and rushed the job to complete by cleaning and putting back same part instead of replacing it to make sure it does not break again.",HomeServe
Faulty push button flush system. Problem diagnosed and replacement complete unit obtained within week and fitted successfully. Very impressed. Thanks ,HomeServe
Simple to book. Plumber was prompt and solved problem with leaky cistern,HomeServe

I had a blocked toilet drain and had no other toilet facility in my home.My request for assistance was given a priority and had excellent service here dealing with the blockage,HomeServe
"Came out quickly. Efficient. Unable to clear problem as further down a shared drain, but he contacted Yorkshire Water for us. He said they would be here within a couple of days, but in fact they arrived within a few hours.",HomeServe
"Initial response was rapid but I had to go through three different engineer appointments (plumber, Outside engineer and SOS) to get an initial diagnosis.  This was from SOS, but subsequently turned out to be inaccurate as no leak could be found in the pipe SOS had diagnosed! Seven holes dug around the property with one very minor and one more major leak found.  However, the leak continues and the problem is not yet fixed.  Two loo cisterns were reported as 'weeping' but no-one has appeared to fix them.The jobsworth in the office wanted a second job card created to continue the work after the first minor leak was found as this was now considered a second job!  There's still a leak, its still the same day, its the same job!",HomeServe
The technician arrived as promised. Fitted a replacement tap promptly.Excellent company attitude and representation.Homeserve can send a plumber so quickly it is almost unbelievable as most other plumbers never arrive.,HomeServe
I phoned the helpline mentioning a blockage with the kitchen waste drain outside. Appointment made for the following day with the agent arriving on time & quickly rectified the problem. Explained the issue in a polite & helpful manner.,HomeServe
"Booking appointment for leaky kitchen tap was very easy online, the engineer (Jose) was very efficient arriving in the allocated time slot and replacing the tap unit in good time. Altogether an excellent experience.",HomeServe

"I have been waiting for a leak under our kitchen floor to be fixed for over 2 months. So far it has taken 5 different visits to tell us we have a leak, but they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deal with it, it always Ã¢â‚¬Å“needs to be referred.Ã¢â‚¬Â We are still waiting for a call for the contractors to fix the leak. The long term damage and mould is now quite severe. Beyond frustrated and would not recommend this company at all.Update: still not resolved and can not get through to anyone in senior management and they do not call back. Sadly no option other than to take legal action. ",HomeServe
"Good response time for initial visit, with planned full repair then set up and carried out to schedule by friendly, neat and efficient plumber.",HomeServe
"Drain blocked. Engineer arrived and jetted a bit but then announced we had a soak away (despite me asserting otherwise), werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered and cleared off. Found Thames water plans showing it was a drain, not a sw, called dynorod who put a bit more effort in and cleared the problem in 15 mins.-- update -- After hearing about my experience, Homeserve contacted me and quickly refunded my costs. Hence an upgraded review.",HomeServe
Quick appointment.Very pleasant plumber  who completed the jobs - a seized mains stop tap?( inappropriate language corrected: think - male chicken )  and wobbly tap on shower room basin within 35minutes.both jobs very satisfactory.  ,HomeServe

"Homeserve claim to be there Ã¢â‚¬Å“24/7Ã¢â‚¬Â unfortunately that is not the case. I called at around 4pm as my elderly motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  upstairs toilet had become blocked. By the time I had got past Hannah, the virtual advisor who could not answer my query, and been left on hold, I finally managed to get hold of an actual person. They told me that we needed a drain engineer and they could not come out as they did not work past 5.30pm. So much for 24/7!!  insisted they sent a plumber, which they did, but he was unable to help. My elderly mother is now having to wait another day without an upstairs toilet, despite being listed as vulnerable, and having medical conditions that mean she finds it difficult to get up and down stairs, and needs an easily available toilet. We are now left waiting to hear if she will be first on the list for tomorrow, or left to suffer for several more hours. We pay for Homeserve as an emergency service,as they advertise a 24/7 service! What a joke! They actually told us we could call another service if we needed our plumbing fixing urgently, which begs the question, why on earth are we paying for Homeserve??!! I would not recommend this company to anyone. Save your money. Either find an alternative, or put your monthly Homeserve fee to one side and if you need an emergency plumber you can afford to pay for one. ",HomeServe
Shower problems resolved quickly and efficiently by Homeserve engineers.I would recommend them to all human beings.,HomeServe
Plumber unable to sort the problem he said if they have to order the part it would be expensive. My local plumber fixed the problem without any replacement parts for sixty pounds.,HomeServe
Having reported drainage issues Home Serve responded within 24 hours and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re fantastic ensuring they got to the bottom of the problem.  When it required some additional work Home Serve arranged drainage to come out and removed the blockage.  Michael was fantastic and knew what the problem was and fixed the issue in no time ensuring everything was nice and clean before he left. Really nice chap and did a fantastic job. Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’,HomeServe
"Recently had 2 issues at my property, a leaking cistern on my downstairs toilet and a leaking overflow on my upstairs toilet. Had to pay 2 payments of Ã‚Â£30 as told 2 separate claims. Plumber came same day to fix leaking cistern but as unable to replace cistern on that day the job was booked for 5 days later so water supply was cut off to this toilet. Was told by person on phone to ask plumber when he came if he could look at upstairs toilet but this was refused as he said job was booked for 3 days later.  Leaking overflow was eventually fixed 3 days later. With regards to the downstairs toilet I received no communication stating what time the plumber would call or even that he was on his way. Unfortunately he turned up at an early hour when the person in the house was in bed and as she is deaf did not hear him at the door. He left a card saying to rebook appointment. On doing this I was told plumber would be back on the same day. As he did not turn up I rung again and had to have the job rebooked for the next day. This time I did receive a phone call from the plumber to say he was on his way and the job was finally completed.",HomeServe
"The drain engineer caused a leak in our ceiling. The repair involved cutting open the ceiling to fix the pipe. Now that it's been done, we're left with a gaping hole in our ceiling and have been told to sort it ourselves. There was a lot of mix up with our claim, plumbers and engineers being sent at the wrong time, mix up of jobs. It has altogether been an unpleasant experience ",HomeServe
Quick response with helpful and friendly plumber who arrived on time and did a very good job.,HomeServe
The plumber was very helpful went into the loft found the leak and fixed it ,HomeServe
"I was pleased with the service, the only concern I had was that it was nearly 2 full days before someone came to fix the problem-leaky taps wasting water! I know you are busy but one suggestion was to come to me @ a time of up to 10pm which would not have been acceptable.",HomeServe
Leak coming through the ceiling on a Sunday morningÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ not ideal. Called Homeserve and they had a plumber out to us in a few hours and all we had to pay was Ã‚Â£30 excess chargeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦!! ,HomeServe
"Not too keen on the automated booking service but the robot was quite efficient.  DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have too wait very long for an engineer to visit.  The rumbling pipes didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happen when he visited, but he guessed what the problem was and changed a part.  This indeed solved the problem.",HomeServe
Although it took 2 days for the rep to attend the drain clearance was effectively and sensibly handled and the Homeserve Rep was quick and efficient,HomeServe

"The young man that  came out to fix the tap, was very professional and did a great job ",HomeServe
"Feeling quite angry as 2 jobs booked for 25/10 and total cost confirmed when booking as Ã‚Â£30. When plumber arrived he said only one job booked (and that was the minor one) which he did do. He suggested I phone Homesense but did say that it was usually Ã‚Â£30 per job. I rang while he was here and was told the same thing, which was not what I was told when I booked. (When booking the cistern leak I just happened to mention the tap in the same area was a bit tight and was told that could be done at the same time and that the TOTAL cost would be Ã‚Â£30. I was then put through to the secure line to pay  before being returned to book the appointment date and time. So the job I originally phoned about was the one where there was actually a water leak). I was given an apology and told the complaint woul be escalated and also that I would be contacted within a few days. This has not happened and I am quite disgusted.",HomeServe
No action taken Your engineer advised me to get tape to repair the crack in the wash basin waste pipe as to replace the pipe would be a larger job entailing removal of tiles.  As I am a widow of 88 I had to get help.  I had paid Ã‚Â£30 to you as excess and so hope that this will be refunded.as excess and hope that will be refunded,HomeServe
Service was great but not happy that plumber travelled 70+ miles to fix a simple blockage,HomeServe

"The plumber, who repaired my bathroom tap, was very pleasant & positive, clearly explaining what he needed to do & why.Just wish my Homeserve policy was cheaper each year rather than more expensive.",HomeServe
Sympathetic telephonist realised the urgency and had engineer visit within a couple of hours. Theengineer (who was helping out from Newcastle)was brilliant and managed to do a temporary repair until the other team could do a permanent repair. This did take several days to happen but the 2 engineers who attended came a few days earlier than booked as they finished previous job early and they did a very good permanent repair in a very short time with no mess.,HomeServe
"Excellent, problem identified and sorted very quickly. Plumber very polite and obviously highly skilled ",HomeServe
The plumber was very polite and repaired the tap leak but unfortunately he only used plumbers tape which is a temporary repair. It needed 2 washers replaced for a permanent repair. Also he loosened the nut which controls the arm of the tap which came undone and caused a flood on the underneath cupboard tap leak,HomeServe
"Drainage engineer Scott was very professional and helped to resolve the problem. Was very polite and friendly, excellent service. ",HomeServe

"It was about 4 oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢clock on Saturday afternoon when I realised the drain was blocked and rang  Homeserve. My telephone call was answered promptly and my details checked from the telephone I used. The operator said someone would be with me by 6.30 and just after half five a beautiful red van arrived. The engineer was neat, friendly and polite. He got his equipment from the van, lifted the drain cover and prodded the blockage. He asked me to flush both toilets and fill the sink with with cold water , which I did, he said when to flush the downstairs toilet again and empty the sink. The water ran through the pipe and out into the main drain. He packed up his equipment, wished me a good evening and went on his way.An excellent prompt job, thank you very much ",HomeServe

"We have been paying for insurance with HomeServe UK for nearly 2 years. We called them on Thursday to alert them of a blocked drain with sewage leaking out above ground. They told us they would come the next day, and didn't show up. When we contacted them they said they would come this morning (Monday), but still no show, and they have not confirmed an appointment for tomorrow in writing, despite many long phone calls stressing the urgency of the situation.  We have been left living in a health hazard and will be making a formal complaint. ",HomeServe
This was the 3rd time I have had to call home serve out for same issue. in the last 4 months. A faulty toilet flush which meant I had to pay the excess.  each time they put a new part in .

"Plumber was excellent, but arrived at 6.30pm despite my appointment being 8am til 1pm. I had to call during the afternoon to be told my appointment had been changed to 12 noon til 6pm. A simple phone call to let me know of this change would have saved me waiting in all day. Communication should be better!",HomeServe
Friendly response to my initial call and appointment confirmed.Unfortunately the plumbers did not arrive within the time scale and then couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t complete job on a further appointments - they were late  due to accompanying plumber not turning up.  This happened again.There seems to be a lack of organisation and the plumbers who came had travelled quite a way so were obviously delayed by traffic etc.  it would have been good to be kept informed about what was happening rather than me having to check.  Job not completed as originally stated.I do realise that plumbers are called to emergencies and often run late but each time they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do what had been specified,HomeServe
Your engineer turned up very quick and on time. Seamed in the morning nd set of not wanting to carry out any work. Then within a couple of minutes of looking at the blockage he had decided was a Yorkshire water issue and had called them on my behalf ,HomeServe
Excellent and speedy response to a leak - worth every penny,HomeServe
I had a leak under my bathroom sink and the home serve plumber fixed the leak quickly and professionally. ,HomeServe
To respond to Homeserve's answer: the tap was dripping onto part of the sink that created a residue (the small chrome hole surrounding the plug hole) causing a residue. This residue then stopped the sink from draining. Sometimes things are not binary and I have cleared the sink myself only for the residue to build up because of the non working tap. The excess is payable everytime thus making the service not fit for purpose,HomeServe
Quick response to sort out a water leak. Helpful and efficient engineer (Paul). Reasonable annual fee.,HomeServe
Great company the service we got was excellent the plumber that came fixed leak and  he  fitted two new valves he was very polite thankyou. ,HomeServe

This caused an issue of water leaking over our laminated floor and the electric wires of our electric chairs ( dangerous).only this time both valves were leaking as he had loosened the other for water drainage. 3rd one ordered new valves said he woul come next day ( Mon 12th November) no show. Rang up Homeserve they said we would get a call back within 24 hours. Ended up ringing them again same night as there was water all over the floor and wires. They had someone come today( November 13th). When the engineer rang me I then had to come out of work. The parts had been cancelled and job had been closed. Parts ordered again. Engineer put ptfe tape and tightened it as much as he could. Got another engineer coming out( 5th one)",HomeServe
the engineer who came was friendly and tried to repair the leak first before having to put in a new mixer tap.              it was quite tricky due to space and other connections. I was very pleased with the job he did and he cleaned everything up after him,HomeServe

"My outdoor water tap was dripping slightly so I decided to repair it if possible. I assumed that a stop valve situated under the kitchen sink would isolate the tap and enable me to do this. However, the stop valvewould not turn. I did not wish to apply too much force so I sought your advice. You duly sent a plumber. He came on Saturday November 2nd and confirmed the stop valve was stiff to turn but he turned it off quite easily. (Stronger fingers than mine) The job took him about a minute. He also advised that if I wished him to look at the dripping outdoor tap it would be a further Ã‚Â£30 on top of the Ã‚Â£30 charged already. I decided not to accept his offer because if we can rack up 30 pound extras as easily as this I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have confidence that I will not be financially bust by the time he goes.IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been paying you premiums for years but this was my first use of your services.I think we should part company donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you?I had to rewrite this message because according to your wokery I used Ã¢â‚¬Å“inappropriate languageÃ¢â‚¬Â In calling a stopc*ck, a stopc**k.We are decidedly not on the same planet.",HomeServe

However, he made no attempt to free the siezed stop tap & no attempt to fit 2 new washers to the mixer tap which was brown and matched the sink. Instead he took that away and fitted a new chrome unit which does not match at all and, being the swan neck type, continues running every time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turned off - hopeless!The 1 good thing he did was to fit a pair of isolator valves on both pipes which will help going forward ",HomeServe

And to top that of, said water tank had just been serviced with themselves a couple of weeks prior, we asked for several things to be checked as had noticed some unusual changes, but was told it's all working perfectly, would seem this was incorrect now we have a flood as now we have a flood due to these changes we asked to be looked at!",247 Home Rescue

"Please, please, please think very carefully before taking out a contract with this company. We have a Home Care policy which covers plumbing amongst other things and when I logged a claim regarding a leaking water pipe in the kitchen, I was initially told that an engineer would NOT be able to come out until the leak was clearly identifiable, visible and accessible. Forgive my confusion, but is this not part of a plumberâ€™s remit?After taking advice from a plumber friend, my husband cleared the area around the pipe. The leak was now clearly visible and accessible.Great, we thought, 247 Home Rescue will now be able to help and I immediately logged the claim a second time. How wrong we were : (When the call handler phoned me I again explained the fault but I was told because Iâ€™d informed (wrongly - itâ€™s not the main supply pipe at all. But hey, what do I know about plumbing?) him it was a main water supply pipe, this is not covered under the policy. I actually asked how can they provide plumbing services when they donâ€™t do plumbing? Ludicrous?!?! I was then asked to email a photo over which I did straight away. Itâ€™s now 24 hours later and Iâ€™ve still not received any communication from them.Please be extremely cautious before you sign on the dotted line.Please also note that the majority of 5* reviews on here are for the low price of the cover or boiler services.",247 Home Rescue

"Absolutely shocking service once again! I should have learned first time around. They will not send anyone to view and assess anything. I have a leak in a wall, and I suggested it could be a leaky tap (within the wall) and they said I wasn't covered because they don't cover taps. I explained i wasn't a plumber and they still said i wasn't covered as it is a tap! I couldn't warn people off this company more. There is always an excuse to not come out.

It took me ages to get through only to be told that if I could not identify where the leak was myself, my insurance would not cover this. All of the summary info and start of the policy did not mention this. Tucked away on page 10 under â€˜trades and accessâ€™ there it was, they wonâ€™t find the problem? What- are you serious. Would never ever insure with this company again",247 Home Rescue
"The service is awful.  They are NOT an emergency service. 2 weeks for a simple toilet repair and still waiting.  Their staff and verifications are pain staking and they are NOT 24.7.  Be warned. Go to another provider.  Horrendous service - truly horrendous.  If I could have given 0 stars I would have done.  Their on line systems are also useless .. They keep calling me despite me asking them to call a different number.  To top it off, if you work then this service is not for you.  Its daytime only and you need to wait in all day for them.  Its only for the unemployed or people who work from home.  This is my genuine experience.  Pathetic !",247 Home Rescue

Complete fabrication as they tried to fix the stopcock before and obviously failed.

"Outside tap wouldn't stop gushing water, so rang them for cover. Turned out that taps aren't covered by the policy, but we could pay for someone to come out, so we did.Plumber said that we needed a new outside tap so went away to get one. When he came to tighten it, he snapped the connection at the wall, so had to just cap the pipe and leave it. Their note says ""Travelled to collect bib tap when fitting tap snapped at not even full tightness will need new tap and new wall plate, capped pipe to stop leak so water could go back on."" Offered to repair the damage for Â£92.12, which I declined.Cancelled the account in November and now they keep texting and emailing me to say that I can come back.

Absolutely diabolical ! I am glad I was up for renewal /cancelled and left for goodMake sure you read the terms and conditions as they basically cover you for nothing ! A broken tap is not an emergency / a completly stuck outside acess door is not covered when I paid premium and thought I was covered for everything+ they call you at ridiculous hours like 6 am this morning waking me and my baby up !!!! And they constantly harass you on the phone to try and sell you more stuffStay away from this rip off company !,247 Home Rescue

"I was with this company for 5 years. They were good but are no longer competitive with rivals and tend to change term and condition without informing. I asked them not to renew my policies and found out they were still charging me for plumbing. Beware of their plumbing cover. Other companies charge less and cover everything but they only cover a leak they can physically see. In the UK all pipes are concealed so this not a genuine plumbing cover, they donâ€™t even cover the unconcealed stuff like cisterns and taps or even the drainage or pipe work behind the plasterboard. They should call it the toilet blockage cover. I asked them for a refund but found out they renewed the contract when I asked them not to and this has been going on for sometime. Find cover elsewhere this company is not honest on what they cover and what they donâ€™t. I was told they covered everything except for taps. ",247 Home Rescue

The repair could not be completed on the first visit as my cistern needed to be removed and the engineer didnâ€™t have the bolts to replace the rusty ones that needed to be hacksawed off. He returned 2 days later and replaced the flush system and the float valve. Communication via text was good throughout. Considering I only pay Â£6.99 a month I thought the service was good, even with a Â£45 excess",247 Home Rescue

"Terrible company. We paid for the full package. Had them out once to unblock a drain which was fine. The second time we called they refused to come and do it unless we found a private company to first put a cctv camera down the drains-  all at our own expense. We never had a problem like this with our previous more well known company. Basically refusing to do the service we are paying for.Also refused to fix our door lock as the door was on a conservatory not attached to the house, even though we pay to cover doors and locks! Policy can't even be cancelled as that will be another Â£134! Don't be fooled into thinking all is good after the first visit, after that, all they care about is taking your money. Complete Con!! Avoid at all costs!! Both of your replies to this complaint are not in any way helpful. You have not contacted me directly, despite me sending you my contact details. You are more concerned with your reputation then good customer service. Shocking. ",247 Home Rescue

"Had a problem with hot water supply. Engineer visited and stated our pipe work was all wrong and a valve fitted was the wrong type. Took some pics and left. Later had a call from 24/7 stating â€˜the field engineer has reviewed the pics and confirms what the visiting engineer has said. We will not cover itâ€™.We got our own plumber in. He laughed, changed the valve, tested the system and left. He stated on his invoice that the valve and the pipe work were completely unremarkable. The only reason Iâ€™ve given 2 not 1 stars is that 24/7 reimbursed me immediately on receipt of my plumbers invoice and report. Like all insurance companies, it seems 24/7â€™s first reaction is NOT to cover if they can get away with it. Donâ€™t give up, stand your ground, and do NOT renew your policy with this company.

Canâ€™t believe the positive reviews on here!Worst company I have ever dealt with.Have Home Emergency cover & they did not provide a service for a blocked toilet (only one in house) however it took them 2 days to advise me they werenâ€™t coming after a delay with the Easter Weekend.Iâ€™m now Â£660.00 out of pocket whilst paying for this cover - or rather wonâ€™t be paying anymore for this cover.,247 Home Rescue

"AVOID AVOID AVOID ITS A CON VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND MUST BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.After bad review last time I dont know where its gone but update on last one.If i could give -ve feedback 24/7 would not get -ve infinity. The company is a CON. I raised a claim that my sink is blocked and shower is blocked. Their Engineer came and said I dont have the parts to fix we will have to come out again to fix. Then it took over 5 days for 24/7 to come back to me on phone and say its not in terms and conditions. Your pipe work is not correct. It was correct when it was working fine but now when it needs fixing its not correct.The Engineer on site also said your boiler drain is not connected and it leaking in the property which needs fixing. I pay preminum price to 24/7 to fix the issues but its a CON. The guy necr fixed the problem and the kitchen sink and shower is still blocked. Boiler pipe is leaking. I want to take 24/7 to court. I would need the reports from your professioanl (unprofessional) engineer who came to the property with out informing.When i raised a complainet 24/7 have the guts to call me and say we will give you compensation for Â£30 and our engineer has said the job is complete.Utter lie. The job is incomplete. The Engineer did not unblock the shower. he did try unblocking the sink by exerting pressure in the sink waste which eventually knocked the bioler pipe out of the ""T"" and now that is also drainging in the house. How unprofessioanl the Engineer also left his tools at my house.They are CON and know they are worng and hence trying to fob off by giving compensation. I need my full money to be returned which is in couple of hundreds and not Â£30.I will for sure cancel with 24/7. British Gas I have had over 15 years at my second house with out any issue or terms and conditions issue like 24/7 has. They just want easy money and not willing to fix the problem.My previous review on 5th April has more details. I would recomend all to think carefully about this company if its easy job they will fix it as its quick in and out which most people can do themselves but if it requires investigation and implmentation they will fob you off and refer you to terms on conditions.BE VERY CAREFUL. THIS IS A CON COMPANY",247 Home Rescue

"This is my second negative experience with this company. I reported a leaking tap on their online page. A couple of days later I received an email saying theyâ€™d tried to phone me and had no answer so if I still required assistance to phone them. They hadnâ€™t tried to phone me as I had no missed calls on my phone, so that wasnâ€™t true.I phoned them only to be told my leaking tap wasnâ€™t covered. I was a bit baffled as itâ€™s on their drop down menu and isnâ€™t mentioned in the one page of whatâ€™s covered and whatâ€™s not covered. The operator then without hesitation said itâ€™s in page 7 of the T&Cs. Obviously a page all their operators are familiar with so they have no need to scour the lengthy documentation to find the clause.Iâ€™ve now looked at all the documentation I received and there is no mention anywhere that they will not repair a leaking tap. So I would like the company to tell me where that clause is buried?My homecare agreement has a big green tick for all plumbing.Last time they refused to fix a lock on my back door as my conservatory door was considered my back door. I could only see a mention of a porch. I left the operator a 1 out of 5 although itâ€™s not his fault. I later received an email asking why I was unhappy?? Really. No reply yet but Iâ€™m not expecting one. Ridiculous that companies say they cover plumbing etc.Theyâ€™ve even removed my claim from my account so itâ€™s no longer there. Iâ€™ll leave my service contract number so the company can show me the clause on page 6 as I canâ€™t find it in anything I have.Well, after telling me theyâ€™d look into their policies to make sure my experience with them doesnâ€™t happen again, I have heard nothing whatsoever. No explanation of where this get out of jail clause they quoted is. Thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve scoured the documents and itâ€™s not there. So they donâ€™t have it.I final bit. I did get my service and on my boiler last time with these guys. I asked the engineer to fill the readings in on my Valliant service book. He didnâ€™t know them as he hadnâ€™t done them, so he made them up!Also, I have a filter attached to the return pipe to the boiler. He hadnâ€™t cleaned that as I had a bit of paint in the seal which wasnâ€™t broken. Heâ€™d never touched it.Can I have a reply about all that ? ",247 Home Rescue
"Dreadful customer service. I have had HUGE problems both times I have tried to use them despite having a Landlord complete house policy including boiler, plumbing and electrics. The first time I had HUGE problems trying to book my boiler service in time for compliance with legislation. Initially they told me that I was calling too early so to try again nearer the time. When I tried nearer the time they tried to give me an appointment which was too late to be compliant. Recently I had problems with booking an emergency plumber. They could not immediately get through to the managing agents so tried to leave a message on an unrelated mobile. They eventually managed to get through to my tenant but then failed to book an appointment and left a potentially problematic water leak for a whole bank holiday weekend. I was eventually informed via my Managing Agent that the supplier had failed to go ahead as they needed to speak to the policy holder- however the supplier had not at any time tried to contact the policy holder and I ended up having to call them. This was due to the excess on my policy which needed to be paid first/upfront. If the policy holder had not been contactable (e.g. abroad etc) then the plumbing fix would not have proceeded as the supplier refuses to invoice for this excess fee and wants immediate payment before any job takes place. This is even despite the problems I explained to their customer service team regarding booking any appointment.Further Update (8/5/24) Despite having reported all the problems that I am having messages that should go to tenant regarding timing of plumbers visit still being sent to landlord's mobile when this is not appropriate/required as these should be sent to the tenant instead. Also as the landlady after the plumber's visit I phoned up 24/7 to obtain a report as to how the plumbers visit had gone and whether the issue was now fixed. Unfortunately 24/7 customer service were unable to advise me. It was important for me to know quite quickly as I am having a new washing machine delivered. I did explain this to the representative but they did not seem at all interested in my dilemma.",247 Home Rescue

Extremely disappointed with this company. After paying Â£14 every month I called them for a pipe leak. They charged Â£95 but took 2 days to send a plumber. He came and said he cant fix because pipes are behind kitchen cabinet. I must go and remove everything for him to work. Contacted the company but a bunch of looters sit there and say they cant do anything. Never touch this company again. I regret choosing them. Homeserve and British gas are much better,247 Home Rescue

"I am extremely disappointed with the handling of my claim for a blocked bathroom sink. I reported the issue on June 8th, and despite several follow-up calls and multiple missed appointments, no proper service was provided. The engineer finally visited on June 13th but stated he couldn't fix the blocked sink. After further unfulfilled promises, I had to hire a local plumber to resolve the issue myself. This lack of service is unacceptable, and I am demanding a refund for the past three years of payments. Avoid this company if you value reliable service!",247 Home Rescue
"Cancelled my cover after 2 1/2 weeks. The plug hole in my Bathroom sink got stuck and I called them to come out and help me. They refused to help me said that this was not covered in my policy, even though they could not point out where in the policy this was written. According to them, this was a maintenance issue. Was very unhappy with the service and ended up cancelling Even though I had already paid for a month of cover. The call centre seems to be based in India Where the staff constantly put you on hold to check with managers. Now I realise why the cover was so much cheaper than HomeServe and British Gas. It may be cheaper, but itâ€™s not worth it. Stay Well clear.In response to their reply- they never gave me a reference number for the issue I had. I am happy for them to look at it further but I have now cancelled my policy with them but my policy number was WS659264. Iâ€™m not surprised they donâ€™t have it on their system ðŸ¥±",247 Home Rescue
Brilliant service from start to finish. The engineer was efficient and polite and got the leak resolved immediately. ,247 Home Rescue
Poor customer service. They are competitive in price but most of the jobs are not covered. I leaked into the shower wall and I have been asked by the Customer advisor to break the tiles so that their engineer can see the leak visible. I'm not sure why you would ask customers to break things for their competent (or not) engineers to observe. They will insist on collecting excess before even confirming whether they can fix the job. Unless you like to throw away the money do not waste your time on this company. ,247 Home Rescue

"I reported a blocked pipe in the kitchen and they sent a drainage engineer who couldn't handle it as the pipe was indoors, despite me telling them beforehand that it was inside. I was then charged Â£93 for a plumber to attend with ""special"" equipment and told I could have a refund if it wasn't used. Two days later a plumber arrived, but could not correct the problem saying the pipework was installed incorrectly when in fact a clip had simply come loose. He did not use any equipment. The company point blank refused to refund me, effectively calling me a liar, and apparently refusing to investigate further. i had the plumber's phone number so got him  to  contact 247 to confirm what I had told them. They offered a refund but no apology. I made a formal complaint and also obtained copies of my phone calls which their investigators showed no signs of having listened to. I was offered Â£30 compensation. In disgust I asked to cancel my policy, due to run for the rest of the year. They eventually agreed. ",247 Home Rescue
"This company charge extra for everything! I had a leaking pipe - they would not attend until I found the pipe and leak location. I had to pay for them to attend. When I tried to cancel my policy, they wanted to charge  for the boiler service but this was an extra amount added to the policy which I have already paid. The terms and conditions say you won't pay more than your annual premium to cancel - it should say ""you will have to pay your annual premium, even if you cancel!""Would not recommend.",247 Home Rescue

I signed up to pay the Â£95 excess on call outs, and it has usually been a lower cost to get a tradesperson direct, after wasting time talking to a totally inept call centre. Now I don't even bother calling them, and certainly won't be renewing our cover on our properties.",247 Home Rescue

First of all the booking appointment is very stressful. Operator asked many questions regarding where is leaking from. Answer that is leaking pipe wasnâ€™t enough. He asked profesional questions to check seals etc.Secondly appointment slot is 9 to 18- all day.There was some miscommunication as contractor come without earlier phone call or message that he is on the way. He thought that he will do boiler job where there was not related to boiler leak.He was polite and did a job that is why 3 stars.

Tomorrow came went and 6 phone calls later they said we did not receive my email. That is after they had confirmed they had. Two days later I am still chasing them as after locating my email they said the leak is not too visible on the pictures. Shocking company.

"I hope someone is fortunate enough to read this review. Iâ€™ve been a long-time customer of British Gas and HomeServe, and there's simply no comparison between them and this company. Trustpilot reviews may not reflect the true experience. This company asks for 5-star feedback after a pleasant conversation, but thatâ€™s before you actually need to make a claim or request a repair.Compared to industry standards set by companies like British Gas, this company falls short. While Iâ€™ve had my frustrations with British Gas, 24/7 Home Rescue is an outright nightmare. My tenant experienced a leak, and while British Gas had no issues with handling repairs directly, 24/7 Home Rescue created endless obstacles. They don't allow tenants to arrange repairs directly, dragging out the process to the point where my tenant was left stranded while I was on holiday.In contrast, British Gas once promptly repaired a leak under the bath without any fuss. But with 24/7 Home Rescue, they insisted we identify the source of the leak ourselves, asking us to open panels and send them videos. How are tenants or students supposed to do that, especially when the landlord lives two hours away? After endless discussions and phone calls, they never even showed up.When I requested a refund for the 10-11 months we had already paid, they flatly refused. Consider yourself lucky if you see this review and avoid this company at all costs. This nightmare happened 10 months ago, and Iâ€™m still appalled by their service.",247 Home Rescue
"I had a home care policy from 247 Home Rescue with an excess claim of Â£95 and â€œUnlimited Call Outs.â€ When I experienced a water leak, I contacted customer service and was asked to pay Â£95 for an engineer visit. Additionally, the engineer was not available immediately, with a wait time of 2-3 days and no guarantee of availability. This policy is misleading; it is not truly â€œUnlimited Call Outsâ€ as it depends on the specific policy. The company, â€œHome Rescue,â€ did not provide the help I needed. They seem more focused on making money than on customer care. I wouldnâ€™t recommend them as they play around with words and provide poor customer service. ",247 Home Rescue
"This company needs to rethink its whole philosophy and what they stand for, and have stated they can do for customers. It's all a complete fabrication. No great customer services. Can't understand most of them as they have staff not in UK!! cheap staff payroll I guess!.. and if you complain they don't listen, and have pre written decisions which tell you that you'll never win or get your money's worth, OR A FAIR DECISION, and then they want to charge you large amounts of money for the whole year worth if you ask to leave because you are not impressed or happy with their poor shoddy treatment. I wish I'd stayed with British Gas Home Care. Guys!... cheaper is not always better. Lesson!They say they cannot move a 'close to the wall' toilet in order to stop the water from constantly flushing. They sent 3 different 'engineers' to my house - and then each time they state that you have to wait in ALL DAY 8-6pm for them to visit (Even British Gas have sorted themselves out and will give you a window of when they will call... who has time to wait in all day for a silly engineer, when we are all so busy?) and if you miss the appointment they will charge you Â£30 for the pleasure!!. The 1st man just came and wandered around my house and didn't even attempt to flush the toilet to see why it was leaking. He reported the job was 'COMPLETE'! The 2nd man was much better and he said in his report that the TOILET NEEDS TO BE MOVED FORWARD to get to the rubber washer behind to sort out the issue.... SO THE COMPANY KNEW THIS .. so why did they then insist on sending another man a few days later to 'LOOK' at my toilet... He then said that the toilet needs to be moved forward to get the washer... 24/7 said he shouldn't do this - even though he was a qualified plumber and had all the tools and replacement parts in his van and the experience to do this. THEN  THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME Â£93 so they could move the toilet forwards. TALK ABOUT A SCAMMMMMM!!! THEY 'UPSELL' their services and things that should have been inclusive in getting the job done in such a shocking barefaced manner.BUYER BEWARE. I am a real life customer and I am tied into this company for the next 10 months and I won't be using them ... but they will still get my money by direct debit MONTHLY.Hey 24/7 NOT SO home care. I am really disappointed in your sales and your customer services. You sold me a damp squib. I need to be allowed to leave your company with NO false charges as you are not going to do my work, and will probably blacklist me as I have spoken out. But the truth needs to be told - so other vulnerable customers don't lose their hard earned cash coming to you. I've been a British Gas Home Care customer for many years, but thought cheaper was better. DON'T DO IT. its not better. Go direct to British Gas Homecare .. all the other startups are simply fakes and cant even live up to their standards with better staff and better customer services as BGH. I need the truth to be told. They have trumped up that i said this and that just to validate their refusal to let me leave and to refuse my complaint. So I have used my voice here to warn other customers of the issues Ive been left to deal with at the hands of this company. I BET IM NOT THE ONLY ONE TO SPEAK OUT WITH THIS COMPANY. But we know we can get 'great' reviews!!!Your response that the complaints dept. will get back to me... They already did. That's why I had to voice my honest and open review on here...This is what they said... 'We therefore are unable to waive your cancellation fee of Â£140 and maintain our position to repair your toilet if you are happy to pay for your toilet removal in the sum of Â£96.Please note that, under terms of our Complaints Procedure, this is our final response.'Its your final response...

I called again after I had to turn the main water supply to avoid more damages. After calling them continuously and me trying to explain the severity and the inconvenience of not having water in the house especially that I have a disabled child and we couldnâ€™t use any water! It was disaster and after me calling few times they refused to send a plumber saying that they donâ€™t cover repairing leak from a main pipe!!!! How is that even possible! I explained that it is a 15mm copper pipe and it is not the main water pipe! They didnâ€™t even apologise or offer a solution. I had to hire a private plumber on an emergency basis and the leak was done in less than 10 minutes! I was fuming and will not renew or recommend this company to anyone. Be wary!

The problem went on for months via phone and emails this caused me anxiety and stress. On one occasion whilst on the phone to them I suffered anxiety attack because we were going around in circles with the conversation hence I ended the call. The call left me unwell for a few days. ,247 Home Rescue
I have been with 24/7 home rescue  for 7 years And 2 times they have let me down .called them out for a pipe leaking in the kitchen and was left  flooded .they left me to call out a emergency  plumber..this time I called  them out for a flooded bathroom on Saturday a morning  but decided  to back to me on Sunday  .Thank you WS0163816,247 Home Rescue
I've had the policy for many years and two sucesful repais. Premium was very cheap but I'm now giving up on it.Ihave a flat where the pipes are behind walls or under floors.I had a leak in the bathroom which was showing up on the floor. To get to the leak the plumber would have needed to access the pipe through the wall. This is turned out was not covered in the policy. The leak must be visible for it to be repaired. The relevent clause says no investigation or access is inlucded. As far as I am concerend this makes the claim to cover plumbing worthless as in most cases the source of the leak is not visible as most pipes are behind walls (unless your home is the Pompidou Centre). Most plumbers do know how to access pipes behind walls in my experience.,247 Home Rescue
Engineer was attentive and very good. Managed to resolve a tap pressure as well and explain how I can deal with it going forward,247 Home Rescue

"What a sham. Gold package we pay for to cover plumbing and phone up with several issues with internal plumbing only to be told they don't cover any of it. Cover not worth the paper it's written on. Complete and utter waste of money. Happy to take money every month but not willing to fix any plumbing issue.Be careful taking anything out with this mob.I would like to update this ,as they wanted more detail. I had reported 3 different issues poor flow at 3 of the 4 taps in house ( stated it wasn't flow into house so nothing to do with scottish water. 2nd problem luke warm water coming out of taps unless u put 2 or more taps on at least.3rd problem toilet wasn't flushing in downstairs toilet, after speaking on phone to 24/7 I was told none of it was covered and nothing they could do.After complaining and highlighting that is specifically said on website Toilet not flushing was covered they then said it was under the terms and conditions and can send someone out but other 2 issues weren't even though I have boiler cover and heating and plumbing cover",247 Home Rescue
I recently had to call out 24/7 for a plumbing emergency.  The engineer was polite professional and friendly.  Excellent service ,247 Home Rescue
Plumber was very polite and new his stuff,247 Home Rescue
"Avoid this company. Absolute no transparency whatsoever and their customer service will entice you as if theyâ€™re selling a dream. I had plumbing work done which was supposed to be the excess paid ONLY. When they arrived, they told me that the system needs flushing and iâ€™d have to pay an extra Â£120 to do this. Whats the point of having the cover if youâ€™re going to charge more? GOD KNOWS HOW MANY MORE HIDDEN CHARGES THERE ARE! The customer representative did not disclose this at the time of making the claim or even mentioned there COULD be an additional cost. All in all, its cheaper to actually source local. Dont be fooled by â€œjust the excess to payâ€",247 Home Rescue
Had a policy for drainage cover and they do not cover drainage issues!,247 Home Rescue
Complaint handlers are not based in uk.When you try to speak to them thry dotn understand you A complaint handler gave me ceo email address. So I can email him.It's over a week no reply from the ceo or anyone from the ceo office.This company is very corrupted and doesn't want to take any ownership.Agent talk like a parrot ðŸ¦œ and they lie through there teeth.I will request everyone to think twice before registering with them.They think customers money in the tree and they just take it without providing good serviceThey don't have there own engineers.They outsource there plumbers.U might aswell go on Google amd find a plumber your self,247 Home Rescue
"My partner and I needed someone to unblock our drains, and 24/7 Home Repairs sent a plumber without the equipment needed to sort out the problem. The booking cost Â£120.00 and the plumber cost Â£120.00. This is back in August 19th 2024. I was upset that we were charged Â£240.00 with no benefits - just a booking but no work was done on the actual property /drains at all. I asked for a refund and 24/7 Home Repairs agreed they would refund Â£120.00. They have not done this and itâ€™s now November. Every time I call, I get many apologies and them asking me again for my details like card number, account number etc â€¦ But they just will not refund me. They are given me lots of apologies with no action despite them telling me theyâ€™ll sort it by the close of day and write credit notes etc. This is why I have now reported them to trading standards.

"Toilet blocked, claim raised on the mobile app, 24/7 called me to confirm an appointment. Next day I got a call asking me if the engineer/plumber could come in a day earlier which was great. The plumber, Mr. Musa went above and beyond to make sure the problem is fixed. First he tried couple of obvious methods to fix the issue which didn't work but he shown true professionalism by not giving up. Finally he fixed the issue despite the challenges. His outfit was soiled, he kept calm and carried on his job. He left the place cleaned. I truly appreciate this gentlemen. All those who attended my previous claims are also great, sorry I don't remember the names of those engineers. Keep up the good work. ",247 Home Rescue
"Very disappointed with the service and engineer that visited my property yesterday. Firstly he was very moody as soon he came in. It was just after 8.30am. If your not a morning person then DONT do any jobs in the morning. He was rude and frankley no help at all. I then rang the desk today advising as my policy includes drainage the engineer should have cleaned it out. Instead the engineer quoted, he isnt going to clean out other people dirt out of the pipes. I need to request for someone to do it. VERY DISAPPOINTED and disgusted with the lack of professionalism. The team on the phone were also no help and said I have to get someone independently to do it. Why am I paying monthly when these people reject to help EVERYTIME I request for a issue to be resolved. This is the first time I have rang them for help and appalled with the negative response. Very bad experience.",247 Home Rescue
"I am utterly disgusted with this home emergency cover with so called 24/7 Home Rescue i called with an gushing water flooding at the house at 17:39, the Rep told me they have no one available today it will have to be tomorrow,In the following morning i called they said no one is available today it will have to be tomorrow.A severe water flooding by the water mains pressure and they leave me a disabled person with my young family in a such a condition without water and they call them self 24/7 home rescue??I requested to speak with the manager but was declined by the Representative.I had to arrange my own plumber even though I had a full house gas Electric water drain and pest cover a full emergency cover yet left me and my family in a devastating situation without help.",247 Home Rescue

poor service when needed. No offer to resolve a simple plumbing issue. Used the excuse that it is a maintenance issue for a leaking damaged u bend pipe under the kitchen sink to deny the claim. would have probably cost them less then Â£20 for parts but willing to take over Â£200 for cover. spoke to Luke a manager and a customer service lady called Millie. Both very intent on telling me T&C and not looking at how they can help me. loosing a new customer,247 Home Rescue
The engineer Musa did a very good job in under an hour in a cramped area behind the toilet.,247 Home Rescue
Daniel was great. He was courteous and professional. He mended my TOLIET even though he thought he was coming to mend my boiler. Absolute diamond geezer!!!,247 Home Rescue
"Absolutely shocking experience with 24/7. I had a slow running sink which suggested an issue was present. Given I had yearly cover with 24/7, I called to have someone come down to take a look. I was sent an engineer 3days later, the engineer suggested a drainage issue but mentioned he wasnâ€™t a drainage engineer and that he would create a report for 24/7 to send out an engineer. I followed up with 24/7 that same day, however they refused to send out a drainage engineer claiming that the job would require a drainage camera to locate the cause of the issue and they donâ€™t cover that despite the fact that I took out the full cover with them and my drains were covered under that plan.  Absolute scammers.",247 Home Rescue
"He arrived very quickly although think must have been having lunch as came in 25 mins after parking.  He was very polite, did the job but with a screwdriver so hopefully hasn't just made a small hole and the problem won't reoccur, only time will tell.",247 Home Rescue
"24/7 an absolute rip off. I kept paying monthly direct debit and paid excess fee Â£95 twice for one event when I had a drainage blocked last month. They send out engineers(cowboys) whom more likely to view and write reports only rather than to complete the task and finally I was told those blocks are not included in the policy. I had to call out plumbers from Checkatrade and job is done after 10 days of 24/7 saga. Surprisingly, this 24/7 is leading all the major comparison sites for boiler and drainage cover, not sure how. Please stay away from 24/7, hassle is not worthy!!!!! A pure SCAM !!!!!!!!!",247 Home Rescue
"I called 24/7 Home Rescue as my kitchen had flooded from a pipe under the sink. After much pressing, someone was sent the same day to fix the pipe. The following day the kitchen was flooded again, I called back and was told the engineer would come out again. Half way through the day the engineer called to say there wasn't much point in the visit, as I had mentioned I was having a plumber come to check the pipes in 4 days and that he couldnâ€™t do anything further. I complained and asked for my Â£95 excess back as the leak was not stopped and did not get resolved and I was refused. They then said I dismissed the engineer and would arrange my own plumber which doesnâ€™t make sense and isnâ€™t true. Iâ€™ve been a customer for many years but when my policy expires I will be going elsewhere. If you have an emergency, I wouldnâ€™t call this company. ",247 Home Rescue

"The engineer was polite and helped remove the blockage.I suspect I have a leak also as the cupboard under the sink was wet yesterday however, it is hard to pinpoint as the pipes feel dry.. I will continue to monitor it.The only issue I had with the engineer is how he left my bathroom. He politely asked to use it  which I agreed to of course.When I went in after he had left there was water everywhere. This includes all over the floor and the basin unit. As I was unsure why, I had to disinfect the entire bathroom. ",247 Home Rescue
"Great availability for the works that took place, works was undertaken in less than 10 minutes but would have been explained the issue before the works took place as we may have decided not to go ahead as excess charge could have been avoided if we decided to do our own works. Engineer was friendly and professional however a little rough in removing the radiator cover which left a broken piece of wood. ",247 Home Rescue

"To be correct â€¦.. the technician was wonderful and sorted out the problem BUT to charge over Â£230 per hour is absolutely scandalous. We clearly stated that this was not an emergency and even if it was most plumbers will charge up to Â£70 call out charge and then Â£60-100 per hour. They charged me for 4 hours work Â£925â€¦. with together with the call out charge would have been nearly Â£1000. Absolutely disgraceful. They initially came out â€¦. as an emergency call on the Friday but the guy couldnâ€™t do the job but I was still charged, then they sent John out the next day ( who was great ) on the Saturday but I was charged more because it was at the weekend. I was also told I would get a price for the job beforehand â€¦.. never happened and I could kick myself for not asking. Just be careful with this company, great job done but scandalous charge. I refused to pay the Â£925 and was given a discount, now paying Â£800 which I still think is very expensive.",247 Home Rescue

"I took out the Complete cover level with Corgi, thinking that whatever went wrong would be covered, including the boiler and central heating system, and all internal plumbing, including waste pipes. I also carefully read the ""exclusions""  shown on the web page describing the details of Complete cover.However, when I had a waste pipe problem, Corgi told me that they would repair the pipe once I had removed the bath and taken up the floor boards.  Despite the list of ""exclusions"" on the sales webpage, on page 15 of their 28 page Terms and Conditions book is a section which reads; ""Access and Making Good Any costs for materials and labour needed: â€¢ to gain access to your boiler or central heating system, â€¢ to gain access to pipes or wiring within walls, ceilings or underfloor and â€¢ for redecoration, restoration of walls, ceilings fixtures and fittings or replacement of floor coverings, once we finish.""In other words, Corgi cover for internal plumbing and pipes only applies to already exposed pipes.  In any modern house, of course,  99% of the pipework is covered; thus your plumbing and pipework is , in effect, not covered by the Corgi plan.Needless to say I will not be renewing my cover with Corgi.",Corgi HomePlan
"Please make sure you read ALL 28 pages of their Terms and Conditions. Especially the two sentences at the bottom of page 10...""If a waste or water leak from internal pipework is discovered and is not directly accessible....we will be unable to repair the fault until you have traced the leak and arranged for access to be made"".

Appalled by the service.My drain issue from 2022 was only fixed  last week. I have had no apology from Corgi for the appalling service. The customer service manager cannot even pick up the phone to apologise. To Corgi customer service- Do NOT reply to this message saying you have got in touch with me as you did under my last review. Because nobody did! I have been a corgi member for over 5 years and this is how you treat your customers.

Craig the man who did the service and replaced the valve on the radiator was so very pleasant and helpful.,Corgi HomePlan
Very helpful plumber who attended.  My only slight criticism (hence no 5 star) was that the pump that needed attention was leaking about a litre of water every couple of hours.  Because of the location of the pump it was difficult to put a tray in place that could manage that much of a leak.  The water was soaking the down stair ceiling but none the less I had to ring after 2 days to find out what was happening to be told that they we still waiting for Corgi to authorise the repair. Once authorised the repair was quickly dealt with.,Corgi HomePlan

I checked my Corgi policy and rang asap, Margret said they would send an engineer soonest, he would give me a call. Minutes later, Simon rang, asked for detail and said he would be with us before lunch, wow, Saturday, thought we would have to wait till Monday. Simon drained the system a bit, swapped out the valve in 30mins, but on refilling, there was some kind of air lock, so boiler didn't fire up. After a couple of goes, success, back in action. An hour later, we noticed a radiator not heating up, so rang Corgi again, James advised me to close off all the other rads and see if that forced the water through the cold one, bingo, I called Corgi back to let them know it was a success, and wouldn't need the engineer back. Andrew, updated their system and said he'd let the others know too. Super helpful all round. Never used the corgi service before, I'm so glad they were there.",Corgi HomePlan

"Great service from Anthony who quickly identified the problem with our leaking central heating pipe. Friendly, courteous service. ",Corgi HomePlan
A first phone call in the morning about two non urgent plumbing issues produced a nearly immediate offer of a visit that same afternoon. We could not make that so the engineer called the next day before 9am. That engineer was highly effective. Excellent service all round. Our only slight criticism was in the initial phone call the two issues in the same bathroom were taken so separately that absolutely everything had to be done twice.,Corgi HomePlan
The engineer came within 4 hours of reporting the problem and the plumber quickly resolved the leak,Corgi HomePlan
It's nice to know that your not judged by your lack of knowledge regarding anything plumbing especially when I was trying to explain my problem to the best of my abilities,Corgi HomePlan

"Reported leak on cistern on March21st. 2 engineers (plumbers)  attended advised eventually that a new water cistern could be fitted April 8/9. I made numerous phone calls to corgi and was fobbed off with excuses . The access would mean the engineer would be bent over all day and this would need 2 engineers!, it would take 5/6 days to get the new part once approval was obtained! Corgi were waiting for their engineer to tell them what was needed but their plumber had already told them on the 23rd, eventually getting customer services to ring me back and I was told they would report back in 6 to 8 weeks.I called a local plumber and the cistern was fitted 3 days later,",Corgi HomePlan
I am very please with plumber who came to sort out my problem with my radiator. Because the previous plumber came had no idea what he supposed to do and also he let me down at the last minute. I highly recommend for the prompt service I received to repair my problem ,Corgi HomePlan

The engineer immediately identified the cause of the leak and replaced the faulty fitting with a new component which he had in his van. He then showed me a photo of the old fitting and its replacement. He had a friendly no fuss disposition and proved to be a worthy ambassador for Corgi. It was a welcomed all-round experience for the customer!,Corgi HomePlan
Problem rapidly sorted out by the engineer and he also resolved a leaking valve. Very happy.,Corgi HomePlan

The tap in my kitchen sink has been splashing all over the sink since the engineer checked the boiler on 18 April 2024. Next day I discover a small piece from the tap. I told another engineer when he was here checking my shower. I asked him to repair it but he said that was not in the contract and suggested that I should get a local plumber but it was caused by the first engineer and I think the company should repair it.,Corgi HomePlan
Plumber arrived as and when we arranged.Did the required work in good time.I have nonegative comments in this regard.,Corgi HomePlan

Helpful member of staff on phone.Quick response by Corgi plumber to my request.Friendly and efficient service by plumber.,Corgi HomePlan
The service was very good. But trying to get the phone number for plumber not great.,Corgi HomePlan
Corgi will find every little way not to come out so definitely would avoid this company. Don't know where all the positive reviews come from but they definitely do not ring true from my experience. Have a leak suspected in my kitchen or bathroom but because I can't identify where the leak is coming from corgi won't come out. Paying Â£34 a month for them to do nothing and they want me to opt in for auto renewal so it's more convenient for me...right ! And to top it off it takes them a minimum of 9 months to have an annual boiler service. Complete sham company who don't do a single thing to help the customer. Merely.interested in lining their own pockets. I would completely avoid this company like the plague and if you have read this review and decided to take out a policy with corgi more fool you.  31.5.24 sounds like corgy plumbers are not covered to do any work. I think they are in the wrong profession. Nail technician seems more suitable for corgy,Corgi HomePlan
the plumber was very competent and very cheerful.,Corgi HomePlan
Stuck with the problem until finally resolved after 5 months mainly down to the last plumber who hung with it until finalised. ,Corgi HomePlan

Issue dealt with promptly from the call centre to the plumber attending.  Happy with the service received. ,Corgi HomePlan
A selection of vulnerable washers and seals should be available to be replaced as part of the annual service.    The requirement for me to pay a policy excess of Â£60 for a further visit to replace a washer worth Â£10 is I believe unreasonable.,Corgi HomePlan
"Great communication by engineer, told me what he was doing and why, and answered a question about why shower goes cold then hot, when someone else turns a tap on/off, where as previous corgi engineer visit said this was normal, and it isn't. Will follow up",Corgi HomePlan

"I have their "" Complete "" level plumbing and boiler insurance . I phoned in to report a leak from my shower tray causing damp on the skirting boardand another leak in the downstairs cloakroom . I had to pay the Â£60 excess on my claim ahead of anyone doing anything . I sent thier plumber pictures of the issue that evening . The following day , their plumber turns up , a bit late after chasing him on the phone . He identifies the issues , leaking shower mastic , so new beading needs to be done and there is a leak from the waste hose on my dishwasher which is causing the damp in the cloakroom . All fine , he says I need to call Corgi , I make myself a coffee and sit in my lounge . I'm wondering why he's taking so long and see his van has gone , no idea what he's doing , but I have a missed call and voicemail from Corgi . None of this work apparently falls under the cover of their "" Complete"" Insurance , they never cover anything shower related , and the waste hose is apparently a machine fault and so we aren't going to do anything about it . "" It's in our T's and C's "" . This is true , the 27 page booklet of small print does specify they don't cover shower cubicles , trays etc.. but this is at odds with the covering letter sent proclaiming everything is insured . I feel it's a con , they took the excess whilst nowing they wouldn't cover at least part of the work required and never mentioned this on the initial phone call .I have previously had a good experience with them , when they did replace my original shower unit ( with a much cheaper model but it's still a shower ! ) . The plumber just left me , no "" Good bye  , or there's a problem with your cover , he just left , with my dishwasher in the middle of the kitchen and the cloakroom light on and fan running , just so very rude and unprofessional . I will not be renewing my cover with them . ",Corgi HomePlan

"I would put 0 if I could, appalling service, will not pay out for repairs, we had two different reasons why they wouldnâ€™t pay our claim. One being lead piping of which it doesnâ€™t state they do not cover repairs to lead piping in their t&cs it just states they will not replace lead piping just for legislation reasons, we were then told that copper piping wonâ€™t be covered it it is damaged, most pipes leak because there is damage to the pipe. They will not pay out so donâ€™t use. They also want you to pay the entire yearâ€™s payments to cancel your contract. Please do not use!!.",Corgi HomePlan

Too many clauses in homeplan. Does not cover you for essential wear and tear such as thermostatic showers  kitchen waste pipes although this should be covered under plumbing as the monthly premiums are not cheap and expensive excess. Waste of time having insurance . Does not even cover unvented cylinder tanks as part of hot water central heating system. Wont be renewing.,Corgi HomePlan
"Your first engineer that came to inspect our blocked drain was a complete waste of time. He insisted on checking out kitchen sink for blockage when we told him it was an outside blockage, then agreed it was and would come back on Monday morning with a camera etc and colleague.

The second engineer couldn't do enough to sort out blocked outside drain which still took a number of days to get sorted but thanks to him everything is back to working properly.",Corgi HomePlan

"Started off with we had to find the water leak in our house. Which we did and then promptly you sent an engineer who didn't get his tools in to be told we need more access. Then though we discussed with him how the job could be completed via another room. When I called I logged a complaint as it was clear the engineer did not want to do the work. He was approx 30th engineer you contacted. By this point we had been without water for 3 days. But it wasn't an ""emergency "" as the water was off. Finally after asking what the budget was and we would find someone local you sent an engineer on day 4. He was at the house no more than an 1hr30min and the jobs was done as discussed with your 1st engineer. This guy was practical and considerate and he didn't waste time in getting it sorted. On day 4 of all of this our downstairs sockets tripped and would not reset. We thought that water from the leak might be involved, the engineer came and identified the fault on day 5 (nothing to do with the water) made a temporary fix by removing the room that was tripping it. He wrote a quote to corgi to get the work completed. I called corgi to check it was in the policy and on day 7 the new ring main was installed. However 2weeks later, I am still waiting a call from customer relations regarding the 9 phone calls to get the 2nd plumber out and why is it not an emergency.  As well as the electrical certificate for the new ring main. All staff were polite and helpful but it did feel like walking through treacle with the call out team when it was clear finding an engineer was not going to be easy, call backs were slow",Corgi HomePlan
"Great service, temporary fix on the day and returned next day with parts and sorted it",Corgi HomePlan
"Friendly and helpful call staff. Action a bit slow, and first engineer totally ineffectual. The second lot worked jolly hard and eventually cleared the blockage.Just be patientâ€¦ and ignore the holding music.",Corgi HomePlan

Efficient friendly helpful engineerLeonâ€¦from Dartford..Explained what he was doing..Mended the problemâ€¦Initial engineer who came earlier did not resolve the problemâ€¦,Corgi HomePlan
Awful experience. Engineer came out and used my wifeâ€™s tongue scraper to unblock the sink. Then left me with no hot water with 2 vulnerable kids. Then questioned by contact centre why I want a SAR. forced to pay Â£60 further to get a valve fixed on top of the original Â£60 where the engineer was here for 8 minutes. All in all raises serious questions on how they deal with vulnerable customers and if they have even considered the FCA recent paper on consumer dutyâ€¦will be canx my policy as soon as this valve is sorted. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL,Corgi HomePlan

He turned up at 7.30 am and sorted the leak out and said any more problems, just ring him! You can't fault that service!",Corgi HomePlan

"After giving a 5 star review last year for a boiler repair I am somewhat disappointed to only give 1 star for a repair to a toilet flexible coupling that was first reported 5 weeks ago, I have lost count of the phone calls I have made, 1 visit from engineers who then failed to come back as promised, I suppose they have to get someone to come out even if itâ€™s only to look at the problem, then they can charge the Â£60 excess. I await for the engineer to come back tomorrow and he seemed decent, this saga is to be continued, after many years of great service I may have to re think and move elsewhere, I have to say though the customer service is very good, poor show in general though, thank god it wasnâ€™t a burst pipe or something more serious.

Very understanding of the situation, he went way above and beyond to help my family. He successfully rerouted the cold water supply, which made a very difficult situation a little better. That was the start of getting the house back into better shape following the accident the previous evening.The customer service from Corgi and the engineer was exemplary.

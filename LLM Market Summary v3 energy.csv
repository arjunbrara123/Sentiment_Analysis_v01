2024,Energy,Appointment Scheduling,"(60.7% positive vs 73.3% market avg) - Customers praise the odd smooth booking ("" appointment made for next day... text confirmation both times "") but far more often complain of long lead-times and missed EV-tariff installs ("" still no charger slot a year after buying my car ""). By contrast, E.ON Energy wins plaudits for proactive follow-ups ("" 100% service once engaged; engineer phoned ahead to tighten the window ""), while Scottish Power shows what to avoid ("" website down, 40-min queue just to clarify what I booked ""). <br><br><b>Action</b>: copy E.ON's ""call-back 24 h before"" practice and publish real-time slot availability."
2024,Energy,Customer Service,"(55.1% vs 85.5%) - Positive calls describe polite agents ("" advisor switched me in five minutes, answered every question ""), yet reviews are dominated by unreturned messages and month-long escalations ("" 5 Aug - still no response... next stop Ombudsman ""). Octopus stands out ("" nice and competent staff "") for rapid, empathetic, single-touch resolution, while Shell's ""vulture-hold music"" reminds us what bad feels like. <br><br><b>Action</b>: pilot Octopus-style front-line empowerment: first-contact ownership and e-mail follow-ups within 2 hrs."
2024,Energy,Energy Readings,"(51.4% vs 75.0%) - Confidence is eroded by missing or stuck smart-meter feeds ("" BG can't be trusted... knowingly mis-billed for months ""). Octopus' ""Meter Catch-up"" emails ("" offered money back if readings disagreed "") reassure users; Shell's disputes show what happens without transparency. <br><br><b>Action</b>: push real-time reading dashboards in the app and auto-credit any estimate >10% off verified usage."
2024,Energy,Engineer Experience,"(77.1% vs 73.6%) - strength - Our engineers are a bright spot: "" punctual, friendly, cleared up afterwards & explained everything "". Only E.ON and OVO score higher, both thanks to courtesy calls and tidy workmanship. <br><br><b>Action</b>: formalise engineer NPS hand-off (photo evidence of tidy site + one-click feedback request) to keep this edge."
2024,Energy,Meter Installations,"(67.6% vs 75.6%) - Install professionalism is praised when it happens, yet many cite repeat visits and Live-Chat dead-ends ("" four chats, still no date ""). E.ON's ""first-time-fit"" process ("" fantastic job of installing our new smart meters "") cuts churn; Shell's poor fits show the risk. <br><br><b>Action</b>: adopt ""install-complete-first-time"" KPI, with engineer stock-check and 30-min pre-arrival triage call."
2024,Energy,Value For Money,"(63.4% vs 79.9%) - Positive movers like the loyalty fixes ("" moved to BG earlier this year, tariff clear and fair "") but many feel over-charged ("" paying more than neighbours, bunch of liars ""). Octopus leads with transparent credits ("" transfer-in tariff sorted quickly ""). <br><br><b>Action</b>: publish personalised ""price-check"" email each quarter benchmarking against Ofgem cap and usage peers."
2024,Energy,Accounts & Billing,"(53.9% vs 78.8%) - Some pensioners value monthly call-backs to check balances, yet the bulk complain of opaque estimates and credit holds ("" within weeks you put my DD up 70%... I have proof ""). Octopus wins again for plain-English bills; Shell's horror stories show the danger. <br><br><b>Action</b>: roll out simplified PDF bill with colour-coded variance and one-click refund request."
